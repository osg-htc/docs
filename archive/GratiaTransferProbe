---+ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for System Administrators who are planning to enable Gratia !GridFTP  transfer probe installed with installation of !BeStMan service,  stand-alone !GridFTP service, or with !GridFTP on top of another storage system such as Hadoop or Xrootd. Gratia !GridFTP  transfer probe generates accounting  information about file transfers and reports it to the central Gratia collector.

All procedures presented in this document in general require _root_ privilegevalidatios.

---++ Introduction

The !BeStMan server is using !GridFTP server to transfer files to/from any Posix compliant file system. Gratia !GridFTP  transfer probe monitor these transfer  by parsing the Globus !GridFTP server logs and reports it to Gratia Collector.  This document describes the Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe configuration procedure. This procedure must be repeated once for every stand-alone !GridFTP server that is installed.

---++ Installing Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe

Gratia !GridFTP  transfer probe is installed simultaneously with any meta-packages containing globus-gridftp-server.  If you have installed =osg-se-bestman=, =osg-se-bestman-xrootd=, =osg-gridftp=, or followed the Hadoop installation instructions, you probably already have these problems.

If you have not followed any of these instructions, the probe can be installed using:
<pre class="rootscreen">
yum install gratia-probe-gridftp-transfer
</pre>

---++ Configuring Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe


%STARTSECTION{"Configuration"}%

Here are the most relevant file and directory locations:

| Purpose | Needs Editing? | Location |
| Probe Configuration | Yes | /etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig |
| Probe Executables | No | /usr/share/gratia/gridftp-transfer |
| Log files | No | /var/log/gratia |
| Temporary files | No | /var/lib/gratia/tmp |
| Gums configuration | Yes | /etc/gums/gums-client.properties |

The RPM installs the Gratia probe into the system crontab, but does not configure it.  The configuration of the probe is controlled by the file

<verbatim>
/etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig
</verbatim>

This is usually one XML node spread over multiple lines.  Note that comments (#) have no effect on this file.  You will need to edit the following:

| Attribute | Needs Editing | Value |
| !ProbeName | Maybe | This should be set to "gridftp-transfer:&lt;hostname&gt;", where &lt;hostname&gt; is the fully-qualified domain name of your gridftp host. |
| !CollectorHost | Maybe | Set to the hostname and port of the central collector.  By default it sends to the OSG collector.  See below. |
| !SiteName | Yes | Set to the resource group name of your site as registered in OIM. |
| !GridftpLogDir | Yes | Set to /var/log, or wherever your current gridftp logs are located |
| !Grid | Maybe | Set to "ITB" if this is a test resource; otherwise, leave as OSG. |
| !UserVOMapFile | No | This should be set to /var/lib/osg/user-vo-map; see below for information about this file. |
| !SuppressUnknownVORecords| Maybe | Set to 1 to suppress any records that can't be matched to a VO; 0 is strongly recommended. |
| !SuppressNoDNRecords | Maybe | Set to 1 to suppress records that can't be matched to a DN; 0 is strongly recommended. |
| !EnableProbe | Yes | Set to 1 to enable the probe. |

---+++ Selecting a collector host

The collector is the central server which logs the !GridFTP transfers into a database.  There are usually three options:

   1 *OSG Transfer Collector*: This is the primary collector for transfers in the OSG.  Use !CollectorHost="gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80".
   1 *OSG-ITB Transfer Collector*: This is the test collector for transfers in the OSG.  Use !CollectorHost=" gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80".
   1 *Site local collector*: If your site has set up its own collector, then your admin will be able to give you an endpoint to use.  Typically, this is along the lines of !CollectorHost="collector.example.com:8880".

*Note:* if you are installing on an itb site, use *gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org* instead of "gratia-osg-transfer.opensciencegrid.org* above.


---+++ Using GUMS authorization mode

The =user-vo-map= file is a simple, space-separated format that contains 2 columns; the first is a unix username and the second is the VO which that username correspond to.  In order to create it you need to configure the gums client.

The primary configuration file for the gums-client utilities is located in =/etc/gums/gums-client.properties=.  The two properties that you must change are:

| Attribute | Needs Editing | Value |
| gums.location | Yes | This should be set to the admin URL for your gums server, usually of the form gums.location=https://GUMS_HOSTNAME:8443/gums/services/GUMSAdmin |
| gums.authz | Yes | This should be set to the authorization interface URL for your gums server, usually of the form gums.authz=https://GUMS_HOSTNAME:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort |

After the gums client is configured to generate the file run the following once by hand:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% gums-host-cron
</pre>

=user-vo-map= should be created in the following location:

<verbatim>/var/lib/osg/user-vo-map</verbatim>

To have cron regularly update this file start the following service:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service gums-client-cron start
</pre>

Make sure the *UserVOMapFile* field is set to this location in

<verbatim>/etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig</verbatim>

Without =user-vo-map= , all gridftp transfers will show up as belonging to the VO "Unknown".


---+++ Using Gridmap based authorization mode

Note: If you are using this mode for authorization, make sure the files /etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf and /etc/grid-security/prima-authz.conf do not exist.

In order to enable generation of grid-mapfile and  osg-user-vo-map.txt by using the edg-mkgridmap cron process to get information form VOMS servers do the following:
<pre class="rootscreen">
edg-mkgridmap 
</pre>
If you have not installed this package, you will need to run =yum install edg-mkgridmap= first.

%ENDSECTION{"Configuration"}%

---++ Validation

%STARTSECTION{"Validation"}%

Run the Gratia probe once by hand to check for functionality:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /usr/share/gratia/gridftp-transfer/GridftpTransferProbeDriver
</pre>

Look for any abnormal termination and report it if it is a non-trivial site issue.  Look in the log files in =/var/log/gratia/&lt;date&gt;.log= and make sure there are no error messages printed.

%ENDSECTION{"Validation"}%

---++ Enabling/Disabling

%STARTSECTION{"Enabling"}%
You can enable the Gratia Transfer probe (and other Gratia probes) with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service gratia-probes-cron start
</pre>

You can disable the Gratia Transfer probe (and other Gratia probes) with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service gratia-probes-cron stop
</pre>


%ENDSECTION{"Enabling"}%

---++ Viewing information

To access the information, go to http://&lt;gratia_host&gt;:&lt;gratia_port&gt;/gratia-reporting/, click on "Custom SQL Query" on the left site menu frame, enter the following query into provided text box:
<pre class="screen">
select * from MasterTransferSummary where ProbeName like 'gridftp-transfer:&lt;your_host_name&gt;';
</pre>
click on "Execute Query" and you will see the total number of transfer per user. To get more detailed information you can execute the following query:
<pre class="screen">
select j.dbid, j.ResourceType ,j.LocalJobId,LocalUserId,j.CommonName,j.KeyInfoContent,j.Status,j.StartTime,
         j.EndTime,j.SubmitHost,m.ReportedSiteName,m.Grid, n.Value,n.StorageUnit 
         from JobUsageRecord j, JobUsageRecord_Meta m, Network n  
         where j.dbid=m.dbid and j.dbid=n.dbid and m.ProbeName like 'gridftp-transfer:&lt;your_host_name&gt;'  order by dbid;
</pre>
