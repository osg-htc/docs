---+ About this Document

The Hadoop Distributed File System (!HDFS) is a highly scalable, very reliable distributed file system developed by the Apache project as a part of the Hadoop data processing system.  The primary contributor (and largest user) is Yahoo.  !HDFS is based on the design of the Google File System.  !HDFS's strengths is in its ability to use commodity hard drives in worker nodes; it can turn a large amount of semi-reliable hardware into a system which is very reliable.

To find out more information about HDFS, [[http://hadoop.apache.org/hdfs/][visit its home page]].  If you are thinking about installing Hadoop, we also recommend reading the [[http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/hdfs_design.html][HDFS architecture page]].

This page covers the OSG's usage of Hadoop, and includes instructions for installing a grid-enabled HDFS system.
