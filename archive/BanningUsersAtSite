---++ About This Document
This document describes the different methods of how to ban users in OSG whether sites are using GUMS or gridmap files for authorization.

---++ Sites using GUMS 1.3
   * Go to the GUMS web interface
      * https://gums-host:8443/gums/
   * Add new  manual group called banned
      * Configuration -> User Groups -> Add

     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/UserGroupAdd.png" alt="UserGroupAdd.png" width='700' height='750' />    

      * Select type = manual and provide name, description. Then save

    <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/BannedGroupAdd.png" alt="BannedGroupAdd.png" width='733' height='304' />    

   * Add this group to a “banned user group”
      * Click on Configuration 
      * Select the group from drop down menu and save

    <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ConfigBannedGroup.png" alt="ConfigBannedGroup.png" width='700' height='300' />    


   * Add user FQAN to the banned group
      * Click on “Manual User Group Members” in “User Management” section
      * Click Add, select the appropriate “user group”
      * Add the user FQAN and save
       %IMPORTANT% We have noticed that just banning DNs instead of FQANs does not work. So please remember to ban FQAN.

---+++ Test if Banning is successfully applied
   * Test the mapping from your CE (as su)
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% gums-host mapUser %RED%"DN"%ENDCOLOR% 
null
</pre>
   * Only if the mapping returns null, the user is banned

---++ Sites using GUMS 1.2
   * No banning option is available directly in GUMS 1.2.x.
   * To ban users an upgrade to 1.3.x is required

---++ Sites using edg-mkgridmap
   * Update /etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf [NOTE: Old Location is edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf (in $VDT_LOCATION)]
      * Add a line 'deny “DN”'  
      * Wild cards are also accepted
      * Regenerate grid-mapfile executing  /usr/sbin/edg-mkgridmap [Old: edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap]
      * Log file can be generally found at /var/log/edg-mkgridmap.log [Old: edg/log/edg-mkgridmap.log]
   * Check your grid-mapfile and confirm that the DN has indeed been removed
