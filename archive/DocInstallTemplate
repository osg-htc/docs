%GRAY%
   * Layout the table of contents before you start writing the document if possible.
   * The purpose of the table of contents is to provide a good overview about the installation procedure. The reader should be able to identify major steps by reading the table of contents.
   * The table of contents also provides quick navigation within the document. Please use expressive names for the individual headings that allow readers to determine what a specific section is about.
   * Adjust the =depth= such that overview and navigation are served best.
   * Example: [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationComputeElementInstall][Compute Element Installation Guide]]
   * All headings start at Level1 "+".
   * The main heading is to be excluded from the table of contents.

---# Applicable Versions (Optional)

%GRAY%
In case the procedure differs significantly for different versions of the OSG or VDT, please include this section.
%ENDCOLOR%

The applicable software versions for this document are %RED%OSG Version >= x.y%ENDCOLOR% and %RED%VDT Version >= a.b%ENDCOLOR%.

---# Introduction (Optional)

%GRAY%
%NOTE% This section may sometimes be called differently, such as "About Compute Element Services".

This optional section may contain a brief technical description. It may explain what the purpose of the installed software is and when it is needed. It should help the reader make a decision if the content of the document is relevant for him. It may also explain terms being used throughout the document complete with links to the Glossary if possible. See for example  the introduction of the [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationWorkerNodeClient#What_is_the_Worker_Node_Client_a][Worker Node Client]].

%ENDCOLOR%

---# Engineering Considerations (Optional)

%GRAY%
Please provide this section if an extensive amount of planning is required before the installation can proceed. This could be installations that require services and/or software to be installed on several machines.
%ENDCOLOR%

---# Requirements
%GRAY%
This section serves as a possible early exit point for readers of the document. It must list all requirements that have to be met in order for a typical installation to succeed. All tools mentioned must be linked. All terminologies used should be linked to the Glossary explaining them.  The Requirements are broken into 4 subsections with the following formatting (example):
%ENDCOLOR%
---## Host and OS
   * A host to install the RSV Service (Can be the CE or a separate, standalone computer)
   * OS is %SUPPORTED_OS%. 
   * Root access

---## Users
The RSV installation will create two users unless they are already created.

| *User* | *Comment* |
| =rsv= | Runs the RSV tests. The RSV certificate (below) will need to be owned by this user. |
| =cndrcron= | Runs the Condor Cron processes to schedule the running of the tests. |

---## Certificates
| *Certificate* | *User that owns certificate* | *Path to certificate* |
| RSV service certificate | =rsv= | =/etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvcert.pem= <br> =/etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvkey.pem= |

---## Networking
%STARTSECTION{"Firewalls"}%
%INCLUDE{"Documentation/Release3.FirewallInformation" section="FirewallTable" lines="rsvin,rsvout,various"}% \
| HTTP |  tcp  |  80  |  %ICON{choice-yes}%  | | My custom HTTP server with special explanation |
%ENDSECTION{"Firewalls"}%
%NOTE% The Networking table should be defined in as section starting with <verbatim> %STARTSECTION{"Firewalls"}% </verbatim> so that they all can be sourced and collected together by the Firewall document.

---## Additional Requirements
Can be added if needed, e.g. for testing requirements:
   * Access to your own certificate if you want to create your voms proxy
   * Your certificate uploaded into a browser if you want to test the WEB UI

---# Installation Procedure

%GRAY%
This section should contain the entire installation procedure. The configuration of the software should be contained in an own subsection (see below) if it requires a significant amount of work and cannot easily be included in the installation procedure presented here.  There are includes for information on repositories and installing certificates as shown below.
%ENDCOLOR%

%INCLUDE{"YumRepositories" section="OSGRepoBrief" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%

%INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefCaCerts" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%


%GRAY%
%NOTE% This procedure covers the success legs only. Everything else should be included in the 'Troubleshooting' section at the bottom! 
%ENDCOLOR%

---## &lt;1st Step of the Installation Procedure&gt;

%GRAY%
Each subsection might start with a brief explanation what the goal of the subsection is.
%ENDCOLOR%

%GRAY%
Each step that involves a terminal display should show the commands in a green box for a user terminal and a red box for the root terminal using:

<verbatim><pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% <command> <parameters>
<output>
</pre></verbatim> 

tag which will look like this for a user terminal.
%ENDCOLOR%

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% command parameters
output
</pre>

%GRAY%
%NOTE% Output that is longer than a few lines should be wrapped into the [[Documentation.DocFormattingRules#Command_Line_and_Output][output twisty]].

Standard variables (such as =OSG_VERSION=) should be used where they exist. The terminal interaction must be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command line _after_ the prompt!

Please consult the [[Documentation.DocFormattingRules#Presenting_the_Unix_Command_Line][formating rules for the command line]] for more detailed information.
%ENDCOLOR%


---## &lt;2nd Step of the Installation Procedure&gt;

%GRAY%
Everything above said about the 1st step applies to this section.
%ENDCOLOR%


---# Configuration Procedure (Optional)

%GRAY%
Non-trivial configuration steps for the software should be presented here. Include an overview of the configuration procedure if the procedure itself is lengthy:
%ENDCOLOR%

In the next step we will configure the service using following steps:

   1 edit this file
   1 open that firewall port
   1 ...

%GRAY%
Steps listed as part of the numbered list above should have their own sub-section inside this section. For example:
%ENDCOLOR%

---## &lt;1st Step of the Configuration Procedure&gt;

%GRAY%
The procedure may require the reader to edit configuration files. We will use a CSS class named _file_ to render a yellow box around the content ( or parts of it ) of the file:

<verbatim><pre class="file">
Config file line a
Config file line b
</pre></verbatim>

%ENDCOLOR%

<pre class="file">
Config file line a
Config file line b
</pre>

%GRAY%
%NOTE% For more information [[Documentation.DocFormattingRules#Presenting_File_Content][see here]].
%ENDCOLOR%

---## &lt;2nd Step of the Configuration Procedure&gt;

%GRAY%
Everything said about the 1st step applies to this and every following step.
%ENDCOLOR%


---# Services 
%NOTE% This is a partial example to show what is included and the formatting.  
Services brief description

---## Starting and Enabling Services
%STARTSECTION{"StartVOMSServices"}%
To start VOMS you need to start several services:
   1. %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlStart"}%
   1. Start voms server<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service voms start
</pre>
%ENDSECTION{"StartVOMSServices"}%

You should also enable the appropriate services so that they are automatically started when your system is powered on: 
   * %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlEnable"}%
   * To enable the other services: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig voms on
</pre>

---## Stopping and Disabling Services
%STARTSECTION{"StopVOMSServices"}%
To stop VOMS you need to stop voms,... , and also the services they use if nothing else is using them:
   1. Stop voms server<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service voms stop
</pre>
   1. %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlStop"}%
%ENDSECTION{"StopVOMSServices"}%

In addition, you can disable services by running the following commands.  However, you don't need to do this normally.
   * %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlDisable"}%
   * To disable the other services: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig voms off
</pre>

---# Validation of Service Operation (Optional)

%GRAY%
Occasionally the steps to validate the success and correct operation of an installation may be _non-trivial_. Please use this _optional_ section to describe how the user can verify the success of the installation.

%NOTE% This section should not become a user guide! Please link to the applicable sections of the user documentation if the service validation requires the reader to execute a user command.
%ENDCOLOR%

---# Troubleshooting
%GRAY%
Please include this section if you can provide useful troubleshooting information here. Use sub sections for each topic you want to address.  Include file locations in a table as shown.
%ENDCOLOR%

---## Useful Configuration and Log Files
In the troubleshooting section of each Install Document, the file locations should be specified as follows:
| *Service/Process* | *Configuration File* | *Description* |
| Service1 | /etc/Service1.cfg | Configuration information for this service |
| Service2 | /etc/Service2.cfg | Configuration information for this service |

| *Service/Process* | *Log File* | *Description* |
| Service1 | /var/log/service.log | Records all service errors |
| | /var/log/service1b.log | Records all service updates |
| Service2 | /var/log/service2.log | Records all service errors |

---# Known Issues

%GRAY%
Restrictions and/or work around for known issues. 
%ENDCOLOR%

---## &lt;How can I resolve this Problem?&gt;

%GRAY%
Use sub-sections for each problem you want to address in particular. Link to ReleaseDocumentation.HelpProcedure at the end if the problem could not be resolved.
%ENDCOLOR%

---# Get Help/Support
To get assistance please use [[Documentation/Release3.HelpProcedure][this page]]. 


---# References (Optional)

%GRAY%
References to additional information.  This document should be as concise as possible, but the reader can use these links if he/she wants more background or information. Link related material here, such as the user guide to the software the user was just installing.
