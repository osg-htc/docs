---++ About This Guide
This page explains how to install the stand-alone Globus !GridFTP server.

The !GridFTP package contains components necessary to set up a stand-alone gsiftp server and tools used to monitor and report its performance. A stand-alone !GridFTP server might be used under the following circumstances:

   * You are serving !VOs that use storage heavily (CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0) and your site has more than 250 cores
   * Your site will be managing more than 50 TB of disk space 
   * A simple front-end to a filesystem allowing access over WAN - for example NFS.
   * !BeStMan is capable of distributing its workload among several gsiftp servers so if you expect large movements of data into/out of your site, multiple gsiftp servers can be set up. 

---++ Before Starting

Before starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting [[#ReferenceSection][the Reference section below]] as needed):

   * *Service certificate:* The HTCondor-CE service uses a host certificate at =/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem= and an accompanying key at =/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem=
   * *Network ports:* !GridFTP listens on TCP port 2811 and the list of ports configured by =GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=

---++ Installing !GridFTP

First, you will need to install the !GridFTP meta-package:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install osg-gridftp
</pre> 
%ENDSECTION{"Install"}%

---++ Configuring !GridFTP

#ConfiguringAuthentication
---+++ Configuring authentication

In OSG 3.3, there are three methods to manage authentication for incoming jobs: the [[InstallLcmapsVoms][LCMAPS VOMS plugin]], [[Edg-mkgridmap][edg-mkgridmap]] and [[InstallGums][GUMS]]. edg-mkgridmap is easy to set up and maintain, and GUMS has more features and capabilities. The LCMAPS VOMS plugin is the new OSG-preferred authentication, offering the simplicity of edg-mkgridmap and many of GUMS' rich feature set. If you need to support [[https://www.racf.bnl.gov/Facility/GUMS/1.4/use_configuration.html][pool accounts]], GUMS is the only software with that capability.

In OSG 3.4, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin is the only available authentication solution.

---++++ Authentication with the LCMAPS VOMS plugin

To configure your CE to use the LCMAPS VOMS plugin:

   1. <p>If you are using OSG 3.3, add the following line to =/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server=:</p>\
<pre class="file">
export LLGT_VOMS_ENABLE_CREDENTIAL_CHECK=1
</pre>
   1. <p>Follow the instructions in [[InstallLcmapsVoms][the LCMAPS VOMS plugin installation and configuration document]] to prepare the LCMAPS VOMS plugin</p>

---++++ Authentication with edg-mkgridmap

%NOTE% edg-mkgridmap is unavailable in OSG 3.4

By default, !GridFTP uses a gridmap file, found in =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile=.
This file is not generated by default.  There are two ways you can generate this file.
You can generate this file manually, by including DN/username combinations.  This is most
useful for debugging.  Otherwise, you can install edg-mkgridmap, which will periodically contact a list of VOMS servers that you specify. It assembles a list of users from those servers and creates a grid-mapfile.  This grid-mapfile serves both as a list of authorized users and provides a mapping from user dns to local user ids. 

To install edg_mkgridmap, perform the following steps
<pre class="rootscreen">
yum install edg-mkgridmap
</pre>
Review =/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf= to make sure that it has all VOs that you are interested in and also to comment out any VOs that you do not wish to support. 
<pre class="rootscreen">
vi /etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf
</pre>
This utility =edg-mkgridmap= runs as a cronjob =/etc/cron.d/edg-mkgridmap-cron= (by default every 6 hours). You can also run =edg-mkgridmap= manually to see that it generates =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile=.  
<pre class="rootscreen">
edg-mkgridmap
</pre>
Then, you can enable/start the service.
<pre class="rootscreen">
/sbin/service edg-mkgridmap start
/sbin/chkconfig edg-mkgridmap on
</pre>

You can read more on this page:
[[Documentation/Release3.InstallComputeElement#5_2_Using_edg_mkgridmap_for_auth][edg_mkgridmap (on the CE)]]

---++++ Authentication with GUMS

%NOTE% GUMS is unavailable in OSG 3.4

By default, !GridFTP uses a gridmap file, found in =/etc/grid-security/gridmap-file=.
If you want to use GUMS security (recommended), you will need to enable it using the following steps:

First, edit =/etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf= and uncomment the globus callout.
<pre class="file">
globus_mapping liblcas_lcmaps_gt4_mapping.so lcmaps_callout
</pre> 
Note that this used to be the full path to the library (=/usr/lib64= or =/usr/lib=), but now we 
rely on the linker for proper resolution in this file.

Next edit =/etc/lcmaps.db= to edit your gums information:
<pre class="file">

...
gumsclient = "lcmaps_gums_client.mod"
             "-resourcetype ce"
             "-actiontype execute-now"
             "-capath /etc/grid-security/certificates"
             "-cert   /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem"
             "-key    /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem"
             "--cert-owner root"
# Change this URL to your GUMS server
             "--endpoint https://%RED%gums.fnal.gov:8443%ENDCOLOR%/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort"
</pre> 

If you would like to run SAZ, you will need to enable the relevant lines in the above file as well (more documentation to be added later).

---+++ Enabling Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe

The [[Documentation/Release3/GratiaTransferProbe][Gratia GridFTP probe]] collects the information about the Gridftp transfers and forwards it to central Gratia collector. You need to enable the probe first. To do this, make sure following is set in =/etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig=:

<pre class="file">
EnableProbe="1"
</pre>

All other configuration settings should be suitable for most purposes. However, you can edit them if needed. The probe runs every 30 minutes as a cron job.

---+++ Optional configuration

---++++ Modifying the environment 

%STARTSECTION{"Environment"}%
Environment variables are stored in =/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server= which is sourced on service startup.
If you want to change LCMAPS log levels, or globus port ranges, you can edit them there.

<pre class="file">
#Uncomment and modify for firewalls
#export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=min,max
#export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=min,max
</pre>

Note that the variables =GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE= and =GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE= can be set here
to allow globus to navigate around firewall rules.

To troubleshoot LCMAPS authorization, you can add the following to =/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server= and choose a higher debug level:
<pre class="file">
# level 0: no messages, 1: errors, 2: also warnings, 3: also notices,
#  4: also info, 5: maximum debug
LCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL=2
</pre>
Output goes to =/var/log/messages= by default. Do not set logging to 5 on any production systems as that may 
cause systems to slow down significantly or become unresponsive.

%ENDSECTION{"Environment"}%

#ConfigMultiHomed
---++++ Configuring a multi-homed server

%STARTSECTION{"MultiHomed"}%
The !GridFTP uses control connections, data connections and IPC connections. By default it listens in all interfaces but this can be changed by editing the configuration file =/etc/gridftp.conf=.

To use a single interface you can set =hostname= to the Hostname or IP address to use:<pre class="file">hostname IP-TO-USE</pre>
You can also set separately the =control_interface=, =data_interface= and =ipc_interface=. E.g. on systems that have multiple network interfaces, you may want to associate data transfers with the fastest possible NIC available. This can be done in the !GridFTP server by setting =data_interface=: <pre class="file">
control_interface IP-TO-USE
data_interface IP-TO-USE
ipc_interface IP-TO-USE</pre>
%ENDSECTION{"MultiHomed"}%

For more options available for the !GridFTP server, read the comments in the configuration file (=/etc/gridftp.conf=) or see the [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/latest-stable/gridftp/admin/#gridftp-configuring][Globus manual]].


---++ Using !GridFTP

%STARTSECTION{"UsingGridFTP"}%
As a site administrator, there are a few ways in which you might use the HTCondor-CE:

   * Managing the !GridFTP server and associated services
   * Using !GridFTP user tools to test transfer operations

#ManagingServices
---+++ Managing !GridFTP and associated services

In addition to the !GridFTP service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation. The specific services are:

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Software* | *Service name* | *Notes* |
| Fetch CRL | =fetch-crl-boot= and =fetch-crl-cron= | See [[InstallCertAuth#Start_Stop_fetch_crl_A_quick_gui][CA documentation]] for more info |
| Gratia | =gratia-probes-cron= | Accounting software |
| !GridFTP | =globus-gridftp-server= | |

%INCLUDE{"Documentation/Release3.DocumentationSnippets" section="ServiceManagement"}%

---++ Validating !GridFTP

%STARTSECTION{"Validation"}%

The !GridFTP service can be validated by using globus-url-copy.  You will need to run =grid-proxy-init= or =voms-proxy-init= in order to get a valid user proxy in order to communicate with the !GridFTP server.

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-url-copy file:///tmp/zero.source gsiftp://yourhost.yourdomain/tmp/zero
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
0
</pre>
Note that you should preferably not try to run validation as root, as globus-url-copy will sometimes
attempt to use the host certificate instead of your user certificate, with confusing results.

[[InstallCertScripts][Instructions]] to request a service certificate.

You will also need a copy of CA certificates (see below).

---+++ Users

%STARTSECTION{"GridUsers"}%
For this package to function correctly, you will have to create the users 
needed for grid operation.  Any user that can be authenticated should be created.

For grid-mapfile users, each line of the grid-mapfile is a certificate/user pair.  Each user in this file should be created on the server.

For gums users, this means that each user that can be authenticated by gums should be created on the server.

Note that these users must be kept in sync with the authentication method.  For instance, if new users or rules are added in gums, then new users should also be added here.
