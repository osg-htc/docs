---+ Removing OSG Software

While =yum= is excellent at installing software, it's not very good at removing unused software.  As most OSG functional units are spread across many RPMs, it is difficult to remove each RPM individually.

OSG provides a plugin, =yum-remove-osg=, to assist sysadmins in removing our software.  It has two design goals:

   * Remove as many unnecessary RPM packages as possible when one of the top-level packages are removed.
   * Provide strong guarantees that removing OSG software will not damage the rest of the system.

The =yum-remove-osg= plugin is a fork of the standard =remove-leaves= plugins, except it will only remove packages if they are only available from a repository considered as part of OSG.

---++ Pitfalls / Gotchas

Please read this section before first using this plugin!

   * The plugin will only remove packages if the corresponding =.repo= file in =/etc/yum.repos.d= contains =consider_as_osg=yes=.
      * All OSG repos have this by default.
      * Packages from EPEL will *not* be removed by default.  OSG uses quite a few packages from EPEL.  If you want to remove EPEL packages that got brought in by OSG, add =consider_as_osg=yes= to the [epel] section in =/etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo=.
   * The plugin will only remove packages if they are from an "OSG" repo, *and that repo is enabled*.  If the OSG repo isn't enabled by default, you'll want to add =--enablerepo=osg= to your =yum remove= command line.
   * If you remove a package =foo=, yum will first try to remove all packages that depend on =foo=, then remove all unused packages.
      * Suppose you have package =bar= depending on =foo= and =foo= depends on =baz= (and nothing else on the system needs =baz=).  Then, =yum remove --osg foo= will first remove =bar=, then =foo=, then =baz=.
   * =osg-ce= depends on =osg-client=, which depends on =osg-wn-client=.  Hence, if you remove =osg-client= or =osg-wn-client= on a CE, *then this will remove the CE* also.
   * Even with this plugin, =yum remove= is not the perfect reversal of a =yum install= command.  If you need a perfect reversal, restore from backup.  This plugin will be acceptable for many, but not all, sites.
      * For example, if an RPM package installed a Unix user named =glexec=, the user will remain on the system after the package removal. 

Before any action happens, =yum= will print out the list of packages it will remove.  *Please review this* list before you confirm!

---++ Installing and Using

To install the plugin, do the following with the appropriate =osg= repo enabled:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install yum-remove-osg
</pre>

Then, to remove a package (such as =osg-ce=):

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum remove --osg osg-ce
</pre>

The two prompts above assume that the =osg= repo is enabled (=osg-testing= if you are an ITB site).
