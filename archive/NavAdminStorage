---+ About this Document

This document is an overview of all twiki document pages related to storage elements.
Included, you will find links to pages to explain the various storage technologies and plan your development.
The following documents are split into the following categories:
   * [[#Planning_and_Reference][Planning and reference]]: General information about each component in a SE
   * [[#Installation_Documents][Installation Documents]]: Specific step-by-step installation instructions
   * [[#Monitoring_Documents][Monitoring Documents]]: Information on how to set up monitoring and probes
   * [[#Client_Storage_Use_Documents][Client tools]]: Information about SRM storage clients and user tools

---+ Storage Elements

Storage Elements are physical sites where data are stored and accessed, for example, physical file systems, disk caches or hierarchical mass storage systems. Storage Elements manage storage and enforce authorization policies on who is allowed to create, delete and access physical files. They enforce local as well as Virtual Organization policies for the use of storage resources. They guarantee that physical names for data objects are valid and unique on the storage device(s), and they provide data access.  A storage element is an interface for grid jobs and grid personnel to access underlying storage through the Storage Resource Management protocol (SRM), the Globus Grid FTP protocol, and possibly other interfaces as well.

To create a storage element, you will need:
   * An SRM interface (such as !BeStMan 2)
   * A !GridFTP server (Globus !GridFTP Server)
   * An underlying storage system (Hadoop, !XrootD, Dcache, Lustre, etc)
