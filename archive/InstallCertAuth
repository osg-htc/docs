---+!! Installing Certificate Authorities Certificates and related RPMs
%TOC%

---+About this Document
This document provides you with details of various options to install the Certificate Authority (CA) certificates and have up-to-date certificate revocation list (CRL).

---+ How to get Help?
To get assistance please use [[HelpProcedure][Help Procedure]].

---+ Background

When installing software with RPMs, you need to decide how you want to install the Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. You might ask "why do I care? Can't you just give them to me?" We can, but you have a few things to consider:

   * What set of CA certificates do you want? How much control do you want over the set of CA certificates? (Some sites might not want to install specific CAs for policy or security reasons.)
   * How do you want to update them?
   * Do you want to centrally manage the CA certificates or install them on each computer at your site?

You have four options for installing CA certificates:

   1. Install an RPM for a specific set of CA certificates.
   1. Install =osg-update-certs=, a program that lets you install/update a predefined set of CA certificates, then adjust the set by adding or deleting specific CAs.
   1. Install an RPM that installs *no* CAs. This is useful when you want your RPM installations to succeed (because our RPMs require CA certificates, and this RPM satisfies that dependency) but you want to manage them with your own technique.
   1. Make no choice, let =yum= decide for you.

Additionally this page also provides instruction on installation of a tool (fetch-crl) to ensure your site has up-to-date certificate revocation list (CRL) from the CA.

---+ First: Set up the yum repositories

%INCLUDE{"YumRepositories" section="OSGRepoBrief"}%

---+ Install CA certificates: Options
Please choose one of the four options to install the CA certificates.

---++ Option 1: Install an RPM for a specific set of CA certificates

If you want to install an RPM for one of our predefined CA certificates, you have two choices to make:

*Choice: Which set of CAs?*
   a. (_recommended_) The OSG CA certificates. This is similar to the IGTF set, but may have a small number of additions or deletions. (See [[InstallCertAuth#Contents_of_OSG_CA_package][here]] for details)
   a. The default [[http://www.igtf.net/][IGTF]] CA certificates.

Depending on your choice, you select one of two RPMs:

%TABLE{ sort="off" valign="top" }%
| *Set of CAs* | *Format* | *RPM name* | *Installation command (as root)* |
| OSG | !OpenSSL-both | osg-ca-certs | =yum install osg-ca-certs= |
| IGTF | !OpenSSL-both | igtf-ca-certs | =yum install igtf-ca-certs= |

*How do I keep CAs updated?*

Please follow the instruction under OsgCaCertsUpdater make sure that the CAs are kept updated.

---++ Option 2: Install osg-update-certs

(In the Pacman world, this was vdt-update-certs).

Install this with: <pre class=screen>%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install osg-ca-scripts</pre>

You have the same choices for CA certificates as above. In order to choose, you will run osg-ca-manage, which will install the CA certificates. Then (if desired) you need to enable periodic updating of the CA certificates.

%TABLE{ sort="off" valign="top" }%
| *Set of CAs* | *Format* | *CA certs name* | * Installation command (as root)* |
| OSG | !OpenSSL-both | osg | =/usr/sbin/osg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url osg= |
| IGTF | !OpenSSL-both | igtf | =/usr/sbin/osg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url igtf= |

Here is an example:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /usr/sbin/osg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url osg
Setting up CA Certificates for OSG installation
CA Certificates will be installed into /etc/grid-security/certificates
osg-update-certs
  Log file: /var/log/osg-update-certs.log
  Updates from: http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version-new

Will update CA certificates from version unknown to version 1.21NEW.
Update successful.

Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

Initially the CA certificates will not be updated. You can tell by looking at:

<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service osg-update-certs-cron  status
Periodic osg-update-certs is disabled.</pre>

You can enable the =cron= job that updates the CA certs with:
<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service osg-update-certs-cron  start
Enabling periodic osg-update-certs:                        [  %GREEN%OK%ENDCOLOR%  ]</pre>

A complete set of options available though =osg-ca-manage= command, including your interface to adding and removing CAs, could be found at [[OsgCaManage][osg-ca-manage documentation]]

---++ Option 3:  Install an RPM that installs no CAs
Install this with: <pre class=screen>yum install empty-ca-certs --enablerepo=osg-empty</pre>

%RED%*Warning:*%ENDCOLOR% If you choose this option, you are responsible for installing the CA certificates yourself. You must install them in =/etc/grid-security/certificates=, or make a symlink from that location to the directory that contains the CA certificates.

---++ Option 4: Make no choice, let yum decide for you
If you use =yum= to install software that requires CA certificates but you haven't made one of these choices, yum will choose a default. Right now, it is Option #1 from above (_Install an RPM for a specific set of CA certificates_), and the osg-ca-certs RPM is chosen.

---++ Install other CAs

In addition to the above CAs, you can install other CAs via RPM. These only work with the RPMs that provide CAs (that is, =osg-ca-certs= and the like, but not =osg-ca-scripts=.) They are in addition to the above RPMs, so do not only install these extra CAs.

%TABLE{ sort="off" valign="top" }%
| *Set of CAs* | *Format* | *RPM name* | *Installation command (as root)* |
| cilogon-basic & cilogon-openid | !OpenSSL-both | cilogon-ca-certs | =yum install cilogon-ca-certs= |

---+ Managing Certificate Revocation Lists

In addition to CA certificates, you normally need to have updated Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) which are are lists of certificates that have been revoked for any reason. Software in the OSG Software Stack use these to ensure that you are talking to valid clients or servers. We use a tool named =fetch-crl= that periodically updates the CRLs.  Fetch CRL is a utility that updates Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). These are lists of certificates that were granted by the CA, but have since been revoked. It is good practice to regularly update the CRL list for each CA to ensure that you do not authenticate any certificate that has been revoked.

Unlike the older Pacman-based version, fetch-crl is now installed as two different system services. The  fetch-crl-boot service runs only at boot time.  The fetch-crl-cron "service" runs fetch-crl every 6 hours (with a random sleep time included) by default.  Both services are disabled by default.  At the very minimum, the fetch-crl-cron "service" needs to be enabled otherwise services will begin to fail as the existing CRLs expire.
In RHEL5 (!CentOS 5, SL5) systems there has been a disruptive update in OSG 3.1.15 that changed the name from fetch-crl to fetch-crl3. If you are affected by the update or want to read more please [[UpgradeFetchCrl2to3][check here]].

---++ Install =fetch-crl=
%STARTSECTION{"FetchCRLInstall"}%
Normally fetch-crl is installed when you install the rest of the software and you do not need to specifically install it. If you do wish to install it, you can install it as:
%STARTSECTION{"FetchCRLInstallShort"}% <pre class="rootscreen">
%RED%# For RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and SL5 %ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install fetch-crl3
%RED%# For RHEL 6 or 7, CentOS 6 or 7, and SL6 or SL7, or OSG 3 _older_ than 3.1.15%ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install fetch-crl
</pre> %ENDSECTION{"FetchCRLInstallShort"}%

%NOTE% The fetch-crl scripts for RHEL 5 (CentOS 5, and SL5) have changed name in OSG 3.1.15. Both the package and the scripts are called =fetch-crl3...= instead of =fetch-crl...=
%ENDSECTION{"FetchCRLInstall"}%


%STARTSECTION{"FetchCRLConfig"}%
---%SHIFT%++ Enable and Start =fetch-crl=
To enable fetch-crl (fetch Certificate Revocation Lists) services by default on the node:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%RED%# For RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and SL5 %ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl3-boot on
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl3-cron on
%RED%# For RHEL 6, CentOS 6, and SL6, or OSG 3 _older_ than 3.1.15 %ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-boot on
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-cron on
%RED%# For RHEL 7, CentOS 7, and SL7 %ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% systemctl enable fetch-crl-boot
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% systemctl enable fetch-crl-cron
</pre>
To start fetch-crl:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%RED%# For RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and SL5 %ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service fetch-crl3-boot start
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service fetch-crl3-cron start
%RED%# For RHEL 6, CentOS 6, and SL6, or OSG 3 _older_ than 3.1.15 %ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service fetch-crl-boot start
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron start
%RED%# For RHEL 7, CentOS 7, and SL7 %ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% systemctl start fetch-crl-boot
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% systemctl start fetch-crl-cron
</pre>
*NOTE*: while it is necessary to start =fetch-crl-cron= in order to have it active, =fetch-crl-boot= is started automatically at boot time if enabled. The start command will run =fetch-crl-boot= at the moment when it is invoked and it may take some time to complete.

---%SHIFT%++ Configure =fetch-crl=
To modify the times that fetch-crl-cron runs, edit =/etc/cron.d/fetch-crl= (or =/etc/cron.d/fetch-crl3= depending on the version you have).

%STARTSECTION{"FetchCRLConfigProxy"}%
By default, =fetch-crl= connects directly to the remote CA; this is inefficient and potentially harmful if done simultaneously by many nodes (e.g. all the worker nodes of a big cluster).  We recommend you provide a HTTP proxy (such as squid) the worker nodes can connect to. [[InstallFrontierSquid][Here]] are instructions to install a squid proxy.

To configure fetch-crl to use an HTTP proxy server:
   * If using =fetch-crl= version 2 (the =fetch-crl= package on RHEL5 only), then create the file  =/etc/sysconfig/fetch-crl= and add the following line: <pre class="file">
export http_proxy=%RED%http://your.squid.fqdn:port%ENDCOLOR%
</pre> Adjust the URL appropriately for your proxy server.
   * If using =fetch-crl= version 3 on RHEL5 via the =fetch-crl3= package or on RHEL6/RHEL7 via the =fetch-crl= package, then create or edit the file =/etc/fetch-crl3.conf= (RHEL5) or =/etc/fetch-crl.conf= (RHEL6/RHEL7) and add the following line: <pre class="file">
http_proxy=%RED%http://your.squid.fqdn:port%ENDCOLOR%
</pre> Again, adjust the URL appropriately for your proxy server.

Note that the ==nosymlinks== option in the configuration files refers to ignoring links within the certificates directory (e.g. two different names for the same file). It is perfectly fine if the path of the CA certificates directory itself (=infodir=) is a link to a directory.

Any modifications to the configuration file will be preserved during an RPM update.

%IF{"$ TOPIC != 'InstallCertAuth'" then="For more details, please see our [[Documentation.Release3.InstallCertAuth][fetch-crl documentation]]." else=""}%
%ENDSECTION{"FetchCRLConfigProxy"}%

Current versions of fetch-crl and fetch-crl3 produce more output. It is possible to send the output to syslog instead of the default email system. To do so:
   1. Change the configuration file to enable syslog: <pre class="file">
logmode = syslog
syslogfacility = daemon</pre>
   1. Make sure the file =/var/log/daemon= exists, e.g. touching the file
   1. Change =/etc/logrotate.d= files to rotate it

---%SHIFT%+ Install the CA Certificates: A quick guide

You must perform one of the following =yum= commands below to select this host's CA certificates.

| *Set of CAs* |  *CA certs name* | * Installation command (as root)* |
| OSG | osg-ca-certs | =yum install osg-ca-certs= %RED%<b>Recommended</b>%ENDCOLOR% |
| IGTF | igtf-ca-certs | =yum install igtf-ca-certs= |
| None* | empty-ca-certs | =yum install empty-ca-certs --enablerepo=osg-empty= |
| Any** | Any | =yum install osg-ca-scripts= |

* The =empty-ca-certs= RPM indicates you will be manually installing the CA certificates on the node. <br/>
** The =osg-ca-scripts= RPM provides a cron script that automatically downloads CA updates, and requires further configuration. <br/>

%NOTE% If you use options 1 or 2, then you will need to run "yum update" in order to get the latest version of CAs when they are released. With option 4 a cron service is provided which will always download the updated CA package for you.
%NOTE% If you use services like Apache's httpd you must restart them after each update of the CA certificates, otherwise they will continue to use the old version of the CA certificates.

---+ Updating CAs/CRLs
---++ Why maintain up-to-date Trusted CA /CRL information
The Trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates, and their associated Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), are used for every transaction on a resource that establishes an authenticated network connection based on end user's certificate. In order for the authentication to succeed, the user's certificate must have been issued by one of the CAs in the Trusted CA directory, and the user's certificate must not be listed in the CRL for that CA. CRLs can be thought of as a black list of certificates. CAs are the trust authorities, similar to DMV that issues you the driving license.  (Another way of thinking CRLs is the do-not-fly lists at the airports. if your certificate shows up in CRLs, you are not allowed access.) This is handled at the certificate validation stage even before the authorization check (which will provide the mapping of an authenticated user to a local account UID/GID). So you do not need to do worry about it; the grid software will do this for you. However, you should make sure that your site has the most up-to-date list of Trusted CAs. There are multiple trust authorities in OSG (think of it as a different DMV for each state). If you do not have an up-to-date list of CAs it is possible that some of your users transactions at your site will start to fail.  A current CRL list for each CA is also necessary, since without one transactions for users of that CA will fail.

%STARTSECTION{"OSGBriefCaCrlUpdates"}%
---++ How to ensure you are get up-to-date CA/CRL information
   1. <p>If you installed CAs using rpm packages (osg-ca-certs,igtf-ca-certs) (Options 1, 4),  you will need to install the software described in OsgCaCertsUpdater, and enable osg-ca-certs-updater service to keep the CAs automatically updated. If you do not install OsgCaCertsUpdater you will have to regularly run yum update to keep the CAs updated.</p>
   1. If you use Option 2 (i.e. osg-update-certs) then make sure that you have cron enabled\
<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service osg-update-certs-cron  status
Periodic osg-update-certs is enabled.</pre>
   1. Ensure that fetch-crl cron is enabled\
<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron  status
Periodic fetch-crl is enabled.</pre>

---++  Useful configuration and log files

Configuration files:
| *Package* | *File Description* | *Location* | *Comment* |
| All CA Packages | CA File Location | =/etc/grid-security/certificates= | |
| All CA Packages | Index files | =/etc/grid-security/certificates/INDEX.html= or =/etc/grid-security/certificates/INDEX.txt= | Latest version also available at http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ |
| All CA Packages | Change Log | =/etc/grid-security/certificates/CHANGES= | Latest version also available at http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/CHANGES |
| osg-ca-certs or igtf-ca-certs | contain only CA files |  | |
| osg-ca-scripts | Configuration File for osg-update-certs | =/etc/osg/osg-update-certs.conf= | This file may be edited by hand, though it is recommended to use osg-ca-manage to set configuration parameters. |
| fetch-crl-2.x | Configuration file | =/etc/fetch-crl.conf= | |
| fetch-crl-3.x | Configuration file | =/etc/fetch-crl3.conf= | |
The index and change log files contain a summary of all the CA distributed and their version.

Logs files:
| *Package* | *File Description* | *Location* | *Comment* |
| osg-ca-scripts | Log file of osg-update-certs | =/var/log/osg-update-certs.log= |  |
| osg-ca-scripts | Stdout of osg-update-certs | =/var/log/osg-ca-certs-status.system.out= |  |

| osg-ca-scripts | Stdout of initial CA setup | =/var/log/osg-setup-ca-certificates.system.out= |  |

---++ Tests
---+++ Test the host certificates
To test the host certificate of a server =openssl s_client= can be used. Here is an example with the gatekeeper:
<pre class=screen>%UCL_PROMPT% openssl s_client -showcerts -cert /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -key /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem -CApath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ -debug -connect osg-gk.mwt2.org:2119</pre>

---++ Frequently Asked Questions
---+++ Location of Certificates?
<pre class="file"> /etc/grid-security/certificates </pre>

---+++ What is the version of OSG CA package I have installed and what are its contents?
The version of the CA package ca  be found at =/etc/grid-security/certificates/INDEX.html= or =/etc/grid-security/certificates/INDEX.txt=. The changes file can be found at =/etc/grid-security/certificates/CHANGES=.

---+++ Contents of OSG CA package?

The OSG CA Distribution contains:
   * [[http://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current/][IGTF Distribution of Authority Root Certificates]] (CAs accredited by the [[http://igtf.net/][International Grid Trust Federation]])
   * [[http://tg-ca.purdue.teragrid.org:8080/ejbca/][Purdue TeraGrid CA]]

Details of CAs in OSG distribution can be found [[Documentation.CaDistribution#Contents][here]]. For additional details what is in the current release, see the [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/][distribution site]] and [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/CHANGES][change log]].

---+++ How can I add or remove a particular CA file?
Add and remove of CA files are supported only if you CA files are being installed using osg-update-certs, which is included in the osg-ca-scripts package (option 2), for all other options no support for adding and removing a particular CA  file is provided by OSG. The preferred approach to add or remove a CA is to use  [[OsgCaManage][osg-ca-manage]]. For adding a new CA =osg-ca-manage add [--dir <local_dir>] --hash <CA_hash>= may be used, while a CA is removed using =osg-ca-manage remove --hash <CA_hash>=.

---+++ Are there any log files or configuration files associated with CA certificate package?
If CA files are installed using =osg-ca-certs= or =igtf-ca-certs= rpms (i.e. options 1, 4) no log or configuration files are present.

Log and configuration files are however present for =osg-ca-scripts= rpm package (option 2).

Config files:  =/etc/osg/osg-update-certs.conf=
Log files: =/var/log/osg-update-certs.log=, =/var/log/osg-ca-certs-status.system.out=, =/var/log/osg-ca-manage.system.out=, =/var/log/osg-setup-ca-certificates.system.out=

---+++ Are CA packages automatically updated?
If CA files are installed using =osg-ca-certs= or =igtf-ca-certs= rpms (i.e. options 1, 4), you will  need to install the software described in OsgCaCertsUpdater, and enable osg-ca-certs-updater service to keep the CAs automatically updated.

If CA files are being installed using  =osg-ca-scripts= rpm package (option 2), CA files are kept up-to-date as long as =osg-update-certs-cron= service the package provides has been started.

---+++ How do I manually update my CA package?
For Option 1: run one of the following =yum update osg-ca-certs= or =yum update igtf-ca-certs= depending on the rpm package you installed.

For Option 4: run =yum update osg-ca-certs=

For Option 2: You do not need to do a manual update, make sure =osg-update-certs-cron= is enabled using
<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service osg-update-certs-cron  status</pre>
If the service is disabled, enable it using
<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service osg-update-certs-cron  start</pre>
If for some extraordinary reason you need to manually update the CA you could run =osg-ca-manage [--force] refreshCA=.

---+++ Where are the configuration files for fetch-crl?

=/etc/fetch-crl.conf= or =/etc/fetch-crl3.conf= for fetch-crl 2.x or 3.x respectively
