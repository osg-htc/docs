---++ !RSV Support

It's a given that there will be bugs in !RSV. Given the distributed ownership of probes, we must have a solid support model to make sure we can deal with them quickly and efficiently.

The model is relatively simple: the VDT team provides front-line support for RSV and asks the probe owners for help as needed. To be more precise.

   1. A user emails either the GOC (goc@opensciencegrid.org) or the VDT (vdt-support@opensciencegrid.org) with a description of the problem. 
   1. If the user emails the GOC and problem is with the !RSV software (as opposed to the !RSV central operations at the GOC), the GOC will assign the ticket to the VDT. 
   1. If the user emails the VDT and the problem is with the !RSV central operations at the GOC (as opposed to the !RSV software), the VDT team will redirect the user to the GOC. 
   1. The VDT team will attempt to answer the ticket as best they can. They are likely to make requests for more detailed logs, perhaps the one created by =osg-system-profiler= or the one created by the =rsv-profiler=.
   1. If the VDT team cannot answer the ticket without help from an expert, they will add the relevant probe developer(s) to the ticket. The VDT will still own the ticket and is responsible for properly resolving the ticket. However, the VDT team expects and needs the probe developers to help out--please help out as much as possible. 

The people that the VDT team will contact are listed [[RsvOwners][in the list of !RSV Owners]].
