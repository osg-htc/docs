---+!! Grid User Management System (GUMS) and Authorization
%TOC%

---+ Introduction

[[Documentation.GlossaryG#DefsGridUserManagementSystem][GUMS]] is a service used to authorize users and map them from their global identity (from their X.509 certificates) to a local Unix account. Some sites prefer to use GUMS instead of a =grid-mapfile= because they can have a single centrally configured service that works for all of the services that need authorization. It's particularly useful for sites that use glexec on all their worker nodes because the =grid-mapfiles= do not need to be replicated to all the worker nodes.

---+ Other tools for Authorization and User Mapping
GUMS is the recommended tool to manage authorization and map grid users to local accounts. alternatively a server can use =edg-mkgridmap= or maintain manually the =grid-mapfile= (not recommended). Here some links about these alternatives
