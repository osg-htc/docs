---+ Introduction

!XRootD is a high performance network storage system widely used in high energy physics experiments such as ATLAS and ALICE. The underlying !XRootD data transfer protocol provides highly efficient access to ROOT based data files.  

This page provides instructions for using a Xrootd client to connect to a !XRootD storage system.

---+ Installing a !XRootD Client

As a user you have three different ways to interact with Xrootd: a file system mounted with !XrootdFS, the application =xrdcp=, LD_PRELOAD.

To use a Xrootd file system mounted with !XrootdFS you don't need any special setup, you will need the !XRootD !FUSE module. 

To use =xrdcp= you need to have it in your path (e.g. =source $INSTALL_DIR/setup.sh=, where =$INSTALL_DIR= is the Xrootd installation directory)

The use of LD_PRELOAD is not recommended if you have any alternative available. 

---++ Install Repositories

If you have not done so, you will need to install the proper repositories:

%INCLUDE{"YumRepositories" section="OSGRepoBrief" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%

---++ Installing !XRootD Client

The !XRootD client is needed to access !XRootD via =xrdcp= or via POSIX preload.

<pre class="rootscreen">
yum install xrootd-client
</pre>

---++ Installing !XRootD Fuse

The !XRootD fuse package is needed to access via !XRootDFS.

<pre class="rootscreen">
yum install xrootd-fuse
</pre>

---+++ Mounting via !XRootD

%INCLUDE{"InstallBestmanXrootdSE" section="mount"}%

---+ Using the !XRootD Client Mechanisms

---++ Using the xrdcp client

From the redirector node, you can run this:
<pre class="screen">
echo &ldquo;This is a test&rdquo; &gt;/tmp/test 
xrdcp /tmp/test xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/test 
xrdcp xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/test /tmp/test1 
diff /tmp/test1 /tmp/test 
</pre>

Users can write in their own space. E.g. a user with Unix account name  =myuser= (the account must exist, eg. in =/etc/passwd=, etc,  on the redirector and on all the data servers) could save a file in Xrootd: 

<pre class="screen">
echo &ldquo;This is a user test&rdquo; &gt;/tmp/test 
xrdcp /tmp/test xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/myuser/test 
</pre>
Note that =xrdcp= creates missing directories.

---++ Tests using the !libXrdPosixPreload library

Using Xrootd with the POSIX preload library 
(replace =/usr/lib64= with =/usr/lib= on 32-bit systems)

<pre class="screen">
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libXrdPosixPreload.so 
echo &ldquo;This is a new test&rdquo; &gt;/tmp/test 
mkdir xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/subdir
cp /tmp/test xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/subdir/test 
cp xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/subdir/test /tmp/test1 
diff /tmp/test1 /tmp/test 
rm xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/subdir/test 
rmdir xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/subdir
</pre>

---++ Tests using !XrootdFS

The directory mounted using !XrootdFS can be used as any other directory mounted on your file system.
All the normal Unix commands should work. You don't need any special setup or library.
Try using =cp=, =rm=, =mv=, =mkdir=, =rmdir=.

Assuming your mount is =/mnt/xrootd=:
<pre class="screen">
echo &ldquo;This is a new test&rdquo; &gt;/tmp/test 
mkdir -p /mnt/xrootd/subdir/sub2
cp /tmp/test /mnt/xrootd/subdir/sub2/test 
cp /mnt/xrootd/subdir/sub2/test /mnt/xrootd/subdir/sub2/test1 
cp /mnt/xrootd/subdir/sub2/test1 /tmp/test1 
diff /tmp/test1 /tmp/test 
rm -r /mnt/xrootd/subdir
</pre>
