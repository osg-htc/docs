---+ About this Document
This document is about the a RSV probe included in the default distribution. 
You need a host with RSV installed according to [[InstallRSV]]. The same document instructs on [[InstallRSV#Configuration][how to configure RSV]] and [[InstallRSV#Troubleshooting][<b>how to troubleshoot framework errors</b>]].

---+ Description

This probe checks the CA certificates on the host where it runs (this new python probe runs the same tests as the old perl probe):
   * Compare the CA certs with the list of CA and md5 checksums at GOC
   * flag a warning if the md5 checksum differs from the one in the list
   * flag a warning is one of the IGTF CA is missing (flag --type EGEE)
   * warnings become critical errors after some hours (option --error-hours 72 as default)
Certificates not included in the GOC list are not verified.
Expiration date and validity are not checked.

This probe can run locally on the RSV host or on remote servers (e.g. CEs, SEs,...)

| *Metric* | *Test description* |
| org.osg.certificates.cacert-expiry | Test the CA certificates as described above |

---+ Manual invocation
This probe can be invoked manually.
It requires:
  * =rsvprobe.py=, providing the base class in Python for RSV Probes, in the PYTHONPATH or in the current directory  
  * optionally =timed_command.py= to be able to enforce timeouts

It accepts the following additional options:
| *Option* | *Description* |
| --error-file FILE_LOCATION | Location where errors should be recorded |
| --error-hours HOURS | Number of hours elapsed before error is to be issued |
| --type TYPE | This parameter determines whether the test should confrom to EGEE or OSG requirement. (Accepted values: osg, egee) (Default: osg) |
| --cacerts-dir DIR | Location of CA certificate files (Default: /etc/grid-security/certificates) |


To invoke manually: <pre class="screen">
$ ./cacert-verify-probe 
RSV BRIEF RESULTS:
OK
OK: CAs are in sync with OSG distribution
</pre>


---+ Provided metrics
The remainder of this page is dedicated to explaining the failure modes of the this probe, and how you might try to resolve them.

---++ Metric  org.osg.certificates.cacert-expiry
Checks the CA certificates on the host where it runs:
   * Compare the CA certs with the list of CA and md5 checksums at GOC
   * flag a warning if the md5 checksum differs from the one in the list
   * flag a warning is one of the IGTF CA is missing (flag --type EGEE)
   * warnings become critical errors after some hours (option --error-hours 72 as default)
Certificates not included in the GOC list are not verified.
Expiration date and validity are not checked.

Failure modes of this metric:
   * *CRITICAL*: one of the following occurred more than _error_hours_ (72) hours from the check:
      * certificate is missing
      * md5 checksum differs form the expected one
   * *UNKNOWN*: 
      * invalid parameter (test type not in list, error hours not integer)
      * cannot find certificate directory or it contains no CA certificates
      * cert dir has unknown certificates type
      * could not calculate md5sums of a CA file
      * could not download the md5sum for CA list from OSG or the file is empty
      * could not download the CA list from OSG or the file is empty
   * *WARNING*: one of the following occurred less than _error_hours_ (72) hours from the check:
      * certificate is missing
      * md5 checksum differs form the expected one
