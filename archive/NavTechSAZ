---+ Introduction

SAZ enables a Grid site administrator to enforce a Grid job whitelist/blacklist capability at his/her site. It does so by providing the site administrator the capability to ban (disable) or enable identity attributes that are associated with the credential that the user uses to run Grid jobs.  These identity attributes are:
   * =User= - A user can be authorized or disabled from running grid jobs based on his/her DN (%LINK_GLOSSARY_DN%), certificate serial number or proxy remaining lifetime. This is useful if you want to temporarally (or permanently) ban a user in response to a security incident or investigation (e.g. following a report that a certificate has been compromised).
   * =Proxy Lifetime= - Enforce a limit on proxy (%LINK_GLOSSARY_VOMS_PROXY%) lifetime on your grid resource.
   * =CA= (%LINK_GLOSSARY_CA%) based on its DN. This would ban a CA and thus all users using grid certificates issued by that CA from running grid jobs on your site.
   * =VO= (%LINK_GLOSSARY_VO%) based on its name. This would ban a VO and thus all users belonging to that VO from running grid jobs on your site.
   * =FQAN= (Fully Qualified Attribute Name) based on its name. This would disable any jobs coming in with voms credentials generated using this FQAN from running on your site.

SAZ also enables an administrator to "trust" a user - which means user is allowed to run grid jobs on the site in question using a vanilla grid proxy (i.e. without a FQAN)

---+ Why might I need SAZ ?
As a site admin for multiple/single grid site, if you have wished for a centralized service to 

   * ban/authorize users/CAs/VOs/Roles across all your sites 
   * control maximum allowed lifetime for incoming user proxies

then, SAZ is exactly what you need.

---+ Is it an alternate to GUMS?

SAZ is not an alternative to %LINK_GLOSSARY_GUMS%.
GUMS primary purpose is to map incoming grid credentials to local user accounts that also provides a limited banning capability.
SAZ is a banning tool that lets you ban credentials based on the attributes described above. 
The grid authentication/authorization infrastructure setup at [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov][FermiGrid]] has been successfully using both GUMS and SAZ for several years.

---+ How Scalable is it?

SAZ has been extensively stress tested by [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov][FermiGrid]] against both legacy and XACML protocols. 
Details on the stress tests and observed SAZ performance are available [[http://cd-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=3811][here]]
