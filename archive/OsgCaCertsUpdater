---+!! OSG CA Certificates Updater
%TOC%

---+About this Document 
This document explains the installation and use of =osg-ca-certs-updater=, a package in the OSG Software 3.x distribution that provides automatic updates of CA certificates.

---+ Requirements
   * OS must be Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 6 or variants.
   * The OSG repositories must be installed and enabled. See the [[YumRepositories][Yum Repositories]] page for instructions.
   * One grid-certificates package from the OSG repositories must be installed as described [[InstallCertAuth#First_Set_up_the_yum_repositorie][here]]. Currently, these are: =igtf-ca-certs=, =osg-ca-certs=.

---+ Install instructions

Run the following command to install the latest version of the updater.
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install osg-ca-certs-updater
</pre>

---+ Services
---++ Starting and Enabling Services

Run the following to enable the updater. This will persist until the machine is rebooted. 
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service osg-ca-certs-updater-cron start
</pre>
Run the following to enable the updater when the machine is rebooted.
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chkconfig osg-ca-certs-updater-cron on
</pre>
Run both commands if you wish for the service to activate immediately and remain active throughout reboots.

---++ Stopping and Disabling Services

Enter the following to disable the updater. This will persist until the machine is rebooted.
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service osg-ca-certs-updater-cron stop
</pre>
Enter the following to disable the updater when the machine is rebooted.
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chkconfig osg-ca-certs-updater-cron off
</pre>
Run both commands if you wish for the service to deactivate immediately and not get reactivated during reboots.

---+ Configuration
While there is no configuration file, the behavior of the updater can be adjusted by command-line arguments that are specified in the =cron= entry of the service.
This entry is located in the file =/etc/cron.d/osg-ca-certs-updater=.
Please see the Unix manual page for =crontab= in section 5 for an explanation of the format.
The manual page can be accessed by the command =man 5 crontab=.
The valid command-line arguments can be listed by running =osg-ca-certs-updater --help=.
Reasonable defaults have been provided, namely:
   * Attempt an update no more often than every 23 hours. Due to the random wait (see below), having a 24-hour minimum time between updates would cause the update time to slowly slide back every day.
   * Run the script every 6 hours. We run the script more often than we update so that downtime at the wrong moment does not cause the update to be delayed for a full day.
   * Delay for a random amount of time up to 30 minutes before updating, to reduce load spikes on OSG repositories.
   * Do not warn the administrator about update failures that have happened less than 72 hours since the last successful update.
   * Log errors only.


---+ Troubleshooting
---++  Useful configuration and log files 

---+++ Configuration file

| *Package* | *File Description* | *Location* | *Comment* |
| osg-ca-certs-updater | Cron entry for periodically launching the updater | =/etc/cron.d/osg-ca-certs-updater= | Command-line arguments to the updater can be specified here |
| osg-release | Repo definition files for production OSG repositories | =/etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo= or =/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-el6.repo= | Make sure these repositories are enabled and reachable from the host you are trying to update |

---+++ Log files

Logging is performed to the console by default.
Please see the manual for your =cron= daemon to find out how it handles console output.

A logfile can be specified via the =-l= / =--logfile= command-line option.

If logging to syslog via the =-s= / =--log-to-syslog= option, the updater will write to the =user= section of the syslog.
The file =/etc/syslog.conf= determines where syslog messages are saved.
