---+ OSG Software Release 3.2.7

*Release Date*: 2014-03-25

---++ Summary of changes

A few sites encountered a situation where the Globus GRAM Job Manager
would repeatedly crash. The circumstances to trigger the initial crash
were rare. However, once it crashed, it could not recover. This problem
is present in OSG versions 3.2.4 through 3.2.6. We applied a patch from
the Globus developers that addresses both the crash and the failure to
recover.

Changes include:
   * Fix globus-gram-job-manager repeated crashes

[[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SOFTWARE%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%223.2.7%22][1 JIRA ticket]] was addressed in this release.

Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the [[Documentation.Release3][Release3]] area of the !TWiki.

---++ Known Issues

---++ Updating to the new release

---+++ Update Repositories

This is the second release in a new [[Documentation.Release3.OSGReleaseSeries][OSG Release Series]].
To update to this new series, you need [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the new OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>


%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
