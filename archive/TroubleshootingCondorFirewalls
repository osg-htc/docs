---++Setting high and low ports for Condor

If a client is firewalled it may be necessary to specify a port range for Condor's use.

---+++Recommendations
In the condor_config file (pointed to by the environment variable =$OSG_CONDOR_CONFIG=) set the following values:
<pre class="file">
HIGHPORT = &lt;high port&gt;
LOWPORT = &lt;low port&gt;
</pre>

Remember to check the client's firewall as well to be certain the specified range is compatible.
