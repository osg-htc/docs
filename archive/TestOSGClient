%ICON{hand}% This document is for OSG users. Simple tests will be introduced which may help testing the correct authentication with and operation of grid resources. This document also provides a _step-by-step guide_ to determine the approximate cause of an error followed by recommendations when a ticket with the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET% should be opened. 

%NOTE% This document does not demonstrate how the Open Science Grid should be used for production runs. None of the techniques presented will _scale_ to production levels! %RED%Do not use these tools for large scale productions runs%ENDCOLOR%, as these will cause the remote site to crash and possible get your account banned - [[Documentation/CondorSubmittingSingleJob][Condor-G]] will work much better.

---+ Introduction

Using a grid resource involves a series of steps that differ from the steps taken on a Unix resource. The following sections introduce and demonstrate each step required to run a basic grid job submission scenario. By understanding these simple tests you will be well prepared to understand, operate and debug complex grid scenarios. The series of tests are:

   1 [[#Authentication_Test][Authentication Test]]: create and verify your grid proxy used to authenticate yourself with a grid resource
   1 [[#Job_Submission_Test][Job Submission Test]]: execute a program on a grid resource
   1 [[#Data_Transfer_Test][Data Transfer Test]]: copy data to and from a grid resource

%NOTE% The *Data Transfer Tests* and the *Job Submission Tests* all depend on the successful completion of the *Authentication Test*. All tests except the authentication test are independent of each other for the purpose of this document and you can select to run only the ones you choose. The _Job Submission Tests_ require access to a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%, which is the terminology used in the OSG to describe a grid resource that can run jobs. Most OSG %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%s have also a !GridFTP server that allows to complete the basic _Data Transfer Tests_ . More complex _Data Transfer Tests_ , the ones using SRM, require access to a SRM %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE%.

---+ Requirements

   1 access to a resource that has [[InstallOSGClient][OSG client tools]] installed
   1 a [[Documentation.CertificateWhatIs][grid user certificate]] installed on the same resource in =$HOME/.globus=
   1 access to a potential test resource ( see next paragraph )

---+ Choose a Test Resource

%ICON{hand}% Except for the [[#Authentication_Test][Authentication Test]] all tests require a grid resource to test against. Consider [[Documentation.FindAvailableResource][this guide]] for choosing an OSG grid resource to run the tests. Make sure to know what your membership %LINK_GLOSSARY_VO% is and that the grid resource you choose supports this VO! This document uses =%UCL_CE%= as an example. It can be customized in the form above. The default is =ce.opensciencegrid.org= which should not be used to run your tests!


---+ Authentication Test

The purpose of your [[Documentation.CertificateWhatIs][grid certificate]] is to authenticate yourself with every service provided by a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%. The authentication process is based on the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509][X.509 Public Key Infrastructure]] which consists of a private key (=userkey.pem=) and a public key (=usercert.pem=). Both files together form your _certificate_ and are by default located in =$HOME/.globus=:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% ls -al $HOME/.globus
total 68
drwxr-x---  4 %UCL_USER% %UCL_USER%  4096 Mar 18 18:50 .
drwx------ 29 %UCL_USER% %UCL_USER% 12288 Jul 28 08:38 ..
drwxrwxr-x  5 %UCL_USER% %UCL_USER%  4096 Jul 20 11:18 .gass_cache
drwx------  4 %UCL_USER% %UCL_USER%  4096 Mar 27 12:14 job

-r--------  1 %UCL_USER% %UCL_USER%  1919 Dec 16  2008 userkey.pem
</pre>

Your certificate can be used to create a limited life-time %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRID_PROXY% or a %LINK_GLOSSARY_VOMS_PROXY%. You should use a VOMS Proxy if your membership %LINK_GLOSSARY_VO% supports VOMS Proxies and is providing a VOMS Server. Some OSG sites may require the use of a VOMS Proxy and will reject authentication requests using Grid Proxies.

%NOTE% If uncertain please contact the *VO Manager* for your membership *VO*.

#AuthenticationTest
---%SHIFT%++ Authentication using a Grid Proxy

To display detailed information about your grid proxy =grid-proxy-info= can be used:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% grid-proxy-info
subject  : /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Firstname Lastname 392994/CN=1692124231

</pre>

_Identity_ is sometimes also referred to as _Grid Identity_ or more frequently as %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN%. The last line of the output above indicates how long your current grid proxy will be valid. A grid proxy is said to have _expired_ if there is not time left on it. To _renew_  your grid proxy the program =grid-proxy-init= is used together with your grid password:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% grid-proxy-init -valid 500:00

---%SHIFT%++ Authentication using a VOMS Proxy

To display detailed information about your voms proxy =voms-proxy-info= can be used:

<pre class="screen">

_Identity_ is sometimes also referred to as _Grid Identity_ or more frequently as %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN%. Note the display of the %RED%extended attributes%ENDCOLOR% The first line marked =timeleft= of the output above indicates how long your current voms proxy will be valid. A voms proxy is said to have _expired_ if there is not time left on it. To _renew_  your voms proxy the program =voms-proxy-init= is used together with your grid password:


<pre class="screen">

</pre>

%NOTE% The command line option =%RED%-voms LIGO:/LIGO%ENDCOLOR%= tells =voms-proxy-init= to contact the VOMS server for the LIGO VO. This may be different for your VO. Locate a file named =vomses= on your submission host to find out more about available VOMS servers. 

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_DETAILED% showlink="Show the example of a failed request"}%

Here what happens with a group you do not belong to, e.g., _/MyGroup_:

<pre class="screen">

</pre>

%NOTE% If a subsequent attempt at a voms proxy fails, as ours did here, the previously generated proxy is still in effect. You can do another =voms-proxy-info --all= to verify this.

%STARTSECTION{"MappingTest"}%
#MappingTest
---%SHIFT%++ Mapping Test

A valid grid proxy does not guarantee that you may successfully authenticate with a remote grid resource. For a successful authentication your %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN% must be _mapped_ on the remote resource. A simple and quick way to check if your *DN* is mapped is to use =globus-run=:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globusrun -a -r %UCL_CE%

GRAM Authentication test successful
</pre>

%NOTE% This example requires the _Grid Resource Allocation Manager (%LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%)_ to be available on the resource. This is usually the case on a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%, but not on a  %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE%. If you want to test authentication with a Storage Element, use the next example instead.
%ENDSECTION{"MappingTest"}%


---+ Job Submission Test

%STARTSECTION{"GramTest"}%
#GramTest
---++%SHIFT% Job Submission using GRAM

The <b>G</b>rid <b>R</b>esource <b>A</b>llocation <b>M</b>anager (%LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%) is a service running on a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% that services your job submission request and which puts your job into execution after successful authentication.

Here we use the =globus-job-run= command to execute the =id= command on the remote resource using the default *fork* %LINK_GLOSSARY_JM%: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE% /usr/bin/id
uid=506(ligo) gid=506(ligo) groups=506(ligo)
</pre>

Upon success =/usr/bin/id= returns information about the user account which has been used to execute the program itself on the grid resource. This is the account that your %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN% is mapped to. Unlike the [[#Mapping_Test][Mapping Test]] this test also verifies that the account exists and that the job manager was able to run the command on your behalf on the compute element.

%NOTE%  If you have a restrictive firewall in place, some of this testing will not work, and you will likely get Globus error 74 or 43. See the [[InstallOSGClient#Firewall_tunning][Condor firewall tuning]] section on how to solve this.<br>
Moreover, if your client is on a home network behind a NAT, you will also need to configure a GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE (range of non privileged ports) on your home router to forward them to the server.

%NOTE% Please open a ticket with the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET% for the resource in case all your configurations are correct and the command did not succeed.

---+++%SHIFT% Test the Availability of a Job Manager

A %LINK_GLOSSARY_JM% is a process running on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% which is managing the execution of your job. By default the job manager =fork= will be used to _fork_ your program directly on the compute element. As a general rule of thumb you should %RED%avoid to use fork%ENDCOLOR% and to execute programs on the compute element unless that is your intention. A not complete list of job managers includes =fork=, =managedfork=, =ccs=, =condor=, =lsf=, =pbs= and =sge=. Depending on the setup of the grid resource more than one job manager may be supported.

Just like in the previous example we can use =globus-job-run= to verify that the =fork= job manager is available and used for the execution: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE%/jobmanager-fork /usr/bin/id
uid=506(ligo) gid=506(ligo) groups=506(ligo)
</pre>

Notice how we append =/jobmanager-fork= to the grid resource to explicitly request it. This can be used to detect if a certain job managers such as =condor= is available: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE%/jobmanager-condor /bin/hostname
dom118
</pre>

Because the job is scheduled to be executed through %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% this command will likely require more time to complete. Here we used the =/bin/hostname= command to return the _hostname_ of the worker node executing the job.

To specify a job manager that is not supported by the grid resource creates a convenient way to find out what job managers are supported by the resource from the comfort of the command line: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE%/jobmanager-pbs /bin/hostname
GRAM Job submission failed because the gatekeeper failed to find the requested service (error code 93)
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
93
</pre>

%NOTE% The <b>names for job managers are case sensitive</b> and are <b>all lower case for %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%</b>.

%ENDSECTION{"GramTest"}%


%STARTSECTION{"CondorTest"}%
#CondorTest
---++ Job submission using Condor-G
This section only applies, if you have installed Condor-G in your client. Skip to the next section if otherwise.

This is a simple test. The [[CondorSubmittingSingleJob][Condor-G tutorial]] documents better more complex examples and you can find even more information in the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/condorg/][Condor-G documentation]].

   1. Create a dummy shell script <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% cat << SCRIPT > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
uname -a
id
SCRIPT
%UCL_PROMPT% chmod a+x test.sh
</pre>
   1. Create a job submit file (replace the %RED%jobmanager-pbs%ENDCOLOR% with the jobmanager you want to use on the CE)<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% cat << JOB > submit.job
universe = grid
grid_resource = gt2 %UCL_CE%/%RED%jobmanager-pbs%ENDCOLOR%

JOB
</pre>
   1. Submit job <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_submit submit.job
Submitting job(s).
1 job(s) submitted to cluster 1.
</pre>
   1. Monitor the job with job <pre class="screen">

   1. Once the job finishes (i.e. is not in the queue anymore), you will get the output in the =output= file.  Check the =log= file for reports on progress or if the job fails.

---+ Data Transfer Test

Data can be transferred to and from a grid resource using a version of ftp that supports grid authentication called %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP%. Each %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% has a %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP% server. Also all %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE% have %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP% servers, either public or behind a different frontend like %LINK_GLOSSARY_SRM%. The =globus-url-copy= command can be used to transfer files using %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP%.

To verify that !GridFTP is working correctly we will 

   1 create a file using =dd=
   1 transfer the file _to_ the grid resource using =globus-url-copy=
   1 transfer the file back _from_ the grid resource using =globus-url-copy=
   1 compare both files using =diff=

First let's create the test file: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/%UCL_CE%.test.0 bs=1k count=1024
1024+0 records in
1024+0 records out
1048576 bytes (1.0 MB) copied, 0.005332 seconds, 197 MB/s
</pre>

Next let's transfer the file to the grid resource: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-url-copy file:///tmp/%UCL_CE%.test.0 gsiftp://%UCL_CE%/~/%UCL_CE%.test.0
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
0
</pre>

To copy the file back to your resource use:<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-url-copy gsiftp://%UCL_CE%/~/%UCL_CE%.test.0 file:///tmp/%UCL_CE%.test.1
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
0
</pre>

Finally let's compare the _original_ with the _copy_ received back from the remote resource: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% diff /tmp/%UCL_CE%.test.0  /tmp/%UCL_CE%.test.1
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
0
</pre>

%NOTE% The =file= protocol in the *URI* is used for files on a local file system. In this case no authentication is performed with the local resource before the file is read or written. Replacing =file= by =gsiftp= always requires a %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP% server running at the resource specified in the URI.


---++ File Transfer using !UberFTP
=uberftp= is another command to transfer files using %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP%. 

<pre class="screen">

#OtherInfoTest
---++ Other Information System Tools
There are many other tools that can query different components of the OSG information system.  The following examples are directed the OSG-ITB repositories (=osg-ress-4.fnal.gov=, the production one is =osg-ress-1.fnal.gov=).
More information can be found in [[Documentation.FindAvailableResource][find available resources]].

[[Documentation.GlossaryR#DefsRess][ReSS]] ([[https://osg-ress-1.fnal.gov:8443/ReSS/][here a Web page]]) can be queried using Condor and !ClassAds: <pre class=screen>%UCL_PROMPT% condor_status -pool osg-ress-4.fnal.gov -format '%s\n' GlueSiteName | sort | uniq
<b>CIT_ITB_1
ITB_INSTALL_TEST_2
ITB_INSTALL_TEST_3
CMS-BURT-ITB
...</b>
</pre>

[[Documentation.GlossaryB#DefsBDII][BDII]] can be queried with =ldapsearch=:
   1. If you have no ldapsearch, you can install =openldap-clients= it with yum: <pre class=rootscreen>%UCL_PROMPT% yum install openldap-clients
</pre>
   1. Query: <pre class=screen>%UCL_PROMPT% ldapsearch -x -LLL -p 2170 -h is-itb.grid.iu.edu -b mds-vo-name=LBNL_VTB,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid

LCG tools (=lcg-info= and =lcg-infosites=) can be used  for queries to the BDII as well:
