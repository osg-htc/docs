---+ Load Balancing !GridFTP

%TOC{depth="3"}%

---++ About This Guide

!GridFTP is designed for high throughput data transfers and in many cases can handle all of the transfers for a site. However, in some cases it may be useful to run multiple !GridFTP servers to distribute the load. For such sites, we recommend using a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)][load balancer]] to distribute requests and present the appearance of a single high-throughput !GridFTP server.

One general-purpose technology for implementing a load balancer on Linux is [[http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/whatis.html][Linux Virtual Server]] (LVS). To use it with !GridFTP, a single load balancer listens on a virtual IP address, monitors the health of the set of real !GridFTP servers, and forwards requests to available ones. Optionally, there can be one or more inactive, backup load balancers that can activate and take over the virtual IP address in case the primary load balancer fails, resulting in a system that is more resilient to failure. LVS is implemented by the [[http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/software/ipvs.html][IP Virtual Server]] kernel module, which can be managed by userspace services on the load balancers such as [[http://www.keepalived.org][keepalived]].

This guide explains how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot the =keepalived= service on a load balancing host for a set of [[Documentation.Release3/InstallOSGGridFTP][GridFTP]] servers.

#BeforeStarting
---++ Before Starting

Before starting the installation process, consider the following requirements:

   * You must have [[http://oim.opensciencegrid.org/oim/gridadmin][grid administrator privileges]]
   * There must be a shared file system for file propagation across !GridFTP servers
   * You must have reserved a virtual IP address and associated virtual hostname

As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:

   * Ensure the host has [[SupportedOperatingSystems][a supported operating system]]
   * Obtain root access to each host

---++ Designing Your Load-Balanced !GridFTP System

Before beginning the installation process, you will need to plan the overall architecture of your load-balanced !GridFTP system: the number of !GridFTP servers, the type of shared file system to run on the !GridFTP servers, whether or not backup load balancers are required, and hardware requirements.

---+++ !GridFTP servers

The number of !GridFTP servers that you should run is determined first and foremost by the expected !GridFTP transfer load at your site and the speed of the links available to each server. For example, if you expect a 20Gbps peak transfer load and have 10Gb links with 80&ndash;90% efficiency, you would need a minimum of 4 !GridFTP servers: 3 to satisfy your desired throughput + 1 for failover or growth.

---++++ Shared file system

The number of !GridFTP servers can also be determined by your hardware needs, which are determined by your choice of shared file system. If you choose a POSIX-based shared file system, plan for machines with more cores, or more !GridFTP hosts to distribute the CPU load. If you are running [[Documentation.Release3.InstallHadoop200SE#Standalone_Gridftp_Node_Installa][GridFTP with Hadoop]], plan for machines with more memory, or more !GridFTP hosts to distribute the memory load.

%NOTE% If you determine that you need only a single !GridFTP host, you do not need load balancing. Instead, follow the [[Documentation.Release3.InstallOSGGridFTP][standalone-GridFTP installation guide]].

---+++ Load balancer(s)

In the recommended direct routing mode, load balancers simply rewrite initial packets from a given request so the hardware requirements are minimal. When choosing load balancer hosts, aim for stability. If your chosen host is unstable or if you do not want to introduce downtime for operating system or hardware updates, one additional load balancer as a backup should be sufficient.

---++ Preparing the !GridFTP Servers

Before adding your !GridFTP hosts to the load-balanced system, each host requires the !GridFTP software, special certificates, and load-balancing configuration.

#ServiceCert
---+++ Acquiring service certificate(s)

When authenticating with a !GridFTP server, clients verify that the server's host certificate matches the hostname of the server. In the case of a load-balanced !GridFTP system, clients contact the !GridFTP server through the virtual hostname, so the !GridFTP server will have to present a certificate containing the virtual hostname as well as the !GridFTP server's hostname. Use the [[Documentation/Release3/GetHostServiceCertificates#Install_the_OSG_PKI_Command_Line][OSG PKI tools]] to request these types of certificates.

If your !GridFTP servers are also running !XRootD, you will need unique certificates for each !GridFTP server. Otherwise, you can request a single certificate that can be shared among the !GridFTP servers.

#WithoutXrootd
---++++ Without !XRootD

The single shared certificate must have the hostname associated with the load-balanced !GridFTP system as its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509_attribute_certificate][common name]] and each !GridFTP servers hostname listed as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name][subject alternative names]].

   1. Request and generate the shared certificate:\
   <pre class=screen>
%UCL_PROMPT% osg-gridadmin-cert-request -H <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">VIRTUAL-HOSTNAME</span> -a <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">GRIDFTP-SERVER-#1-HOSTNAME</span> <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">[&hellip;]</span></pre>
   1. Copy the resulting certificate-key pair to each !GridFTP server
   1. Create a directory to contain the shared service certificate:\
     <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir /etc/grid-security/gridftp</pre>
   1. Place the shared service certificate-key pair in the newly created directory:\
     <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mv <span style="background-color: #D1CAF2;">PATH-TO-SERVICE-CERT</span> /etc/grid-security/gridftp/gridftp-hostcert.pem
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mv <span style="background-color: #D1CAF2;">PATH-TO-SERVICE-KEY</span> /etc/grid-security/gridftp/gridftp-hostkey.pem</pre>
   1. Edit =/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server= to identify the shared service certificate-key pair:\
     <pre class="file">export X509_USER_CERT=/etc/grid-security/gridftp/gridftp-hostcert.pem
export X509_USER_KEY=/etc/grid-security/gridftp/gridftp-hostkey.pem</pre>


#WithXrootd
---++++ With !XRootD

!XRootD requires that the certificate's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509_attribute_certificate][common name]] refers specifically to the host it resides on. To ensure each !GridFTP server can authenticate using the virtual hostname, add it as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name][subject alternative name]] for each certificate.

   1. Create a list of !GridFTP server hostnames in =load-balanced-hosts.txt=:\
<pre class=screen>
<span style="background-color: #D1CAF2;">GRIDFTP-SERVER-#1-HOSTNAME</span> <span style="background-color: #D1CAF2;">VIRTUAL-HOSTNAME</span>
<span style="background-color: #D1CAF2;">GRIDFTP-SERVER-#2-HOSTNAME</span> <span style="background-color: #D1CAF2;">VIRTUAL-HOSTNAME</span>
<span style="background-color: #D1CAF2;">[&hellip;]</span>
</pre>
   1. Submit a batch request for the per-GridFTP server certificates:\
<pre class=screen>
%UCL_PROMPT% osg-gridadmin-cert-request -f load-balanced-hosts.txt
</pre>
   1. Copy the resulting certificates and keys to their corresponding !GridFTP servers in =/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem=, respectively.

---+++ Installing !GridFTP

Whether you are starting from scratch or adding more !GridFTP servers to your load-balanced !GridFTP system, follow the documentation for [[Documentation.Release3.InstallOSGGridFTP][installing a standalone !GridFTP server]] for each of your intended !GridFTP servers (skip section 2.2, requesting a certificate). For hosts with !GridFTP already installed, skip this section.

---+++ Configuring your !GridFTP servers

Each !GridFTP server requires changes to its IP configuration and potentially its arptables: 

   * [[#AddingVIP][Adding your virtual IP address]]
   * [[#DisableArp][Disabling ARP]] &minus; if your !GridFTP servers are on the same network segment as the virtual IP

#AddingVIP
---++++ Adding your virtual IP address

Use the virtual IP address of your load balancer(s) as the secondary IPs of each of your !GridFTP servers. 

   1. Add the virtual IP using the =ip= tool:\
<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% ip addr add <span style="background-color: #D1CAF2;">VIRTUAL-IP-ADDRESS</span>/<span style="background-color: #D1CAF2;">SUBNET-MASK</span> dev <span style="background-color: #D1CAF2;">NETWORK-INTERFACE</span></pre>
   1. To persist the virtual IP changes across reboots, edit =/etc/rc.d/rc.local=, and add the same command as used above.
   1. Make sure that =/etc/rc.d/rc.local= is executable:\
<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chmod u+x /etc/rc.d/rc.local</pre>

#DisableArp
---++++ Disabling ARP

If your !GridFTP servers and load balancer(s) are on the same network segment, you will have to disable ARP on the !GridFTP servers to avoid [[http://kb.linuxvirtualserver.org/wiki/ARP_Issues_in_LVS/DR_and_LVS/TUN_Clusters][ARP race conditions]]. Otherwise, skip to [[#PreparingKeepalived][the section on preparing keepalived]].

#PreparingKeepalived
---++ Preparing Keepalived Load Balancer(s)

---+++ Installing Keepalived

Whether you run a single load balancer, or have one active load balancer and some inactive backups, each load balancer host must have the =keepalived= software installed, configured, and running.

%NOTE% Do not install =keepalived= on the !GridFTP servers themselves.

The =keepalived= package is available from standard operating system repositories. Install it on each load balancer host using the following commands:

<ol>
%INCLUDE{"Documentation/Release3/OSGReleaseSeries" section="Update"}%
  <li>
    <p>Install the =keepalived= package:</p>
    <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install keepalived</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

---+++ Required configuration

On the primary load balancer, edit =/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf=:

<pre class="file">global_defs {
   router_id <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">STRING-LABEL-FOR-YOUR-LOAD-BALANCED-SYSTEM</span>
}

vrrp_instance VI_gridftp {
    state MASTER
    interface <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">NETWORK-INTERFACE</span>
    virtual_router_id <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">INTEGER-BETWEEN-0-AND-255</span>

        TCP_CHECK {
            connect_timeout 3
            connect_port 2811
        }
    }
    real_server <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">GRIDFTP-SERVER-#2-IP-ADDRESS</span> {
        TCP_CHECK {

        }
    }
    <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">[&hellip;]</span>
}</pre>

%NOTE% Use the same =VIRTUAL-IP-ADDRESS= throughout the configuration of your load-balanced !GridFTP system.

%NOTE% In the =virtual_server= section, write one =real_server= subsection for each !GridFTP server behind the load balancer.

#OptionalConfig
---+++ Optional configuration

The following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be required for setting up a small cluster of !GridFTP hosts. If you do not need any of the following special configurations, skip to [[#UsingKeepalived][the section on using keepalived]].

   * [[#BackupLoadBalancers][Adding backup load balancers]]
   * [[#EmailNotifications][Enabling e-mail notifications]]

#BackupLoadBalancers
---++++ Adding backup load balancers

If you need to add backup load balancers, copy =/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf= from your primary load balancer and change the =state= and =priority= attributes under your =vrrp_instance VI_gridftp= section:

%NOTE% Priority specifies the order of preferred load balancer fallback, where larger values corresponds to a higher preference.

<pre class="file">vrrp_instance VI_gridftp {
    state BACKUP
    interface <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">NETWORK-INTERFACE</span>
    virtual_router_id <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">SAME-ID-AS-MASTER-LOAD-BALANCER</span>

    }
}
</pre>

#EmailNotifications
---++++ Enabling e-mail notifications

To receive e-mails when the state of your load-balanced system changes, update the =global_defs= section of =/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf= for each of your load balancer nodes:

<pre class="file">
notification_email {
<span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">NOTIFY-EMAIL-ADDRESS-#1</span>
<span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">NOTIFY-EMAIL-ADDRESS-#2</span>
