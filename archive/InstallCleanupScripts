Here we describe how to install and configure the OSG Cleanup Scripts on your Linux machine.
This document is intended for site administrators who want to clean up Globus files that build up over time on a Compute Element.

---+ About the Software

The cleanup script located at =/usr/sbin/osg-cleanup= is run by the =cron= daemon on the user's behalf.
The default scripts that ship with it will clean up various Globus files and directories that are left behind.
It is possible to add custom scripts (see below) to do cleanup specific to your site.

The following files and directories in users' home directories will be cleaned.
Note that the locations of these can be overriden (see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/RelocatingGlobusDirs][here]] for details):
   * Globus state directory: =/var/lib/globus/gram_job_state=
   * User gass cache =&lt;user home&gt;/.globus/.gass_cache=
   * User Globus job directory (old) =&lt;user home&gt;/.globus/job=
   * User Globus job directory (new) =&lt;user home&gt;/.globus/&lt;user name&gt;/.globus/job=
   * User GRAM job manager logs =&lt;user home&gt;/gram_job_mgr_&lt;integer&gt;.log=
   * User GRAM scratch directories =&lt;user home&gt;/gram_scratch_&lt;random string&gt;=
   * Globus Scheduler Event Generator logs =/var/lib/globus/globus-seg-*/*=

---+ Installation

The cleanup scripts are provided by the =osg-cleanup= RPM and are installed as part of the [[InstallComputeElement][Compute Element Installation]].

=osg-configure= can be used to customize the behavior of the cleanup scripts, if desired.
The configuration settings that =osg-configure= uses for the cleanup scripts can be found in =/etc/osg/config.d/10-misc.ini=.
It is not necessary to modify them unless you want to customize the behavior of the cleanup scripts.
The defaults are reasonable for most sites, with the following caveat:
%IMPORTANT%
If your site expects to have jobs that run for longer than 14 days, you must customize the =cleanup_age_in_days= variable.
A limitation of =osg-cleanup= is that it does not detect whether or not the Globus temporary files it cleans up are in use.
If a temporary file used by a running job gets removed, that job might be killed.
Set the value of the =cleanup_age_in_days= variable to a number of days higher than you expect your long running jobs to complete.
If for some reason this is not possible (for example, if the maximum runtime of a job is unbounded), do not use the =osg-cleanup= script.

; The OSG cleanup scripts are provided to help remove Globus files that                         
; build up over time on your system.  For more information see the Twiki:                       
;  https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallCleanupScripts              

; The age in days after which files that have not been accessed should be                       
; deleted. Jobs that run longer than this number of days may be killed because                  
; necessary files may be removed.  If this is a problem for you do not run the                  
; osg-cleanup scripts and email vdt-support@opensciencegrid.org                                 
; Default = 14

; is @vo-file.  This will open osg-user-vo-map.txt and try to get the list

---+ Starting OSG Cleanup Scripts

Run this command to enable the =osg-cleanup= cron job:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service osg-cleanup-cron start
</pre>
Run this command to enable the =osg-cleanup= cron job on reboot:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig osg-cleanup-cron on
</pre>

---+ Stopping OSG Cleanup Scripts

Run this command to stop the =osg-cleanup= cron job:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service osg-cleanup-cron stop
</pre>
Run this command to disable the =osg-cleanup= cron job on reboot:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig osg-cleanup-cron off
</pre>

---+ Advanced Topic: Adding Custom Cleanup Scripts

The cron job automatically executes all scripts found in =/usr/libexec/osg-cleanup= directory that are:

   * owned by _root_
   * permissions set to _0700_

The following environment variables are available to all children cleanup scripts:

| *Variable* | *Comment* |
| $OSG_CLEANUP_AGE | Age in days after which files will be deleted. |
| $OSG_CLEANUP_USER_FILE | Path to a file containing a list of user accounts and home directories to clean up.  The format is: &lt;user&gt; &lt;user home&gt; |

---+ Validation of Service Operation

   1 Verify that the log file =/var/log/osg/osg-cleanup.log= has been created and inspect its contents.
   1 Run the cleanup script =/usr/sbin/osg-cleanup= with the =--dry-run= option and inspect the output
<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /usr/sbin/osg-cleanup --dry-run</pre>

---+ Known Issues

The =--dry-run= option causes the scripts in =/usr/libexec/osg-cleanup= to not be run, decreasing its ability to validate the operation.
See the JIRA ticket [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-829][SOFTWARE-829]] for details.

The scripts do not clean up custom user directories listed in RVF files.
See the JIRA ticket [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-828][SOFTWARE-828]] for details.
