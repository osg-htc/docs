---+ About this Document
This document is about the RSV Java Version SSH probe included in the default distribution. 
You need a host with RSV installed according to [[InstallRSV]]. The same document instructs on [[InstallRSV#Configuration][how to configure RSV]] and [[InstallRSV#Troubleshooting][<b>how to troubleshoot framework errors</b>]].

---+ Description

This probe is designed to run the same tests as the JavaVersionProbe (which tests which versions of Java are installed and in use by various components), but it is run against an SE without a jobmanager.

The probe uses ssh to connect to the remote server, so passwordless ssh access for the =rsv= user on the RSV host to the remote servers must be set up for this to work (for instance, using ssh public keys).

---+ Setting up passwordless SSH access

In order for this probe to work, the =rsv= user on the RSV host must be able to ssh to the remote servers without a password.  This can be done with ssh public keys.  First you will need an =rsv= account on both the RSV host and the remote servers.  You may need to create it manually on the remote servers.

Example to generate ssh public keys on RSV host:
<pre class="screen">
root@el6-rsv ~ # su - rsv
rsv@el6-rsv ~ $ ssh-keygen -t dsa
Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/rsv/.ssh/id_dsa): 
Created directory '/home/rsv/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/rsv/.ssh/id_dsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/rsv/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
be:a3:eb:9a:10:1d:4a:7c:6d:81:48:c7:19:b0:60:41 rsv@fermicloud098.fnal.gov
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ DSA 1024]----+
|oE++o+.          |
|.o.o+. .         |
|  + o o          |
| . + o           |
|  o .   S        |
|   .   .         |
|  .     .        |
|   . .  ..       |
|    oo+o..       |
+-----------------+
</pre>

After ensuring the =rsv= user exists on the remote server, you can copy the new public key from the RSV host (=~rsv/.ssh/id_dsa.pub=) into the remote server's =authorized_keys= file (=~rsv/.ssh/authorized_keys=), either manually or with the =ssh-copy-id= program:

<pre class="screen">
rsv@el6-rsv ~ $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub fermicloud106.fnal.gov
The authenticity of host 'fermicloud106.fnal.gov (131.225.155.53)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is b1:2f:37:37:bb:1e:2c:20:57:5d:17:8c:6e:59:89:be.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'fermicloud106.fnal.gov,131.225.155.53' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Now try logging into the machine, with "ssh 'fermicloud106.fnal.gov'", and check in:

  .ssh/authorized_keys

to make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.
</pre>

If you use =ssh-copy-id= you may need to type the =rsv= password the first time.  Once you have added the RSV host's ssh public key to the remote server's =authorized_keys= file, make sure you can ssh from the =rsv= user on the RSV host to the remote server without a password.

---+ Manual invocation
This probe can be invoked manually, from an RSV install or from SVN.
It requires:
   * =rsvprobe.py=, providing the base class in Python for RSV Probes
   * =java-version-probe= and =worker-scripts/java-version-probe-worker= to do the actual work on the remote server

To invoke manually: <pre class="screen">
$ .# ./java-version-ssh-probe -u remote-hostname
RSV BRIEF RESULTS:
OK
OK: Java packages queried.

---+ Provided metrics
The remainder of this page is dedicated to explaining the failure modes of the this probe, and how you might try to resolve them.

---++ Metric  org.osg.general.java-version-ssh
Checks which versions of Java are installed and in use by various components:
  * connects via ssh to a remote host and runs the =java-version-probe=.

Failure modes for this metric are the same as the JavaVersionProbe, with the additional possibility that the ssh connection itself can fail.  In that case you will want to ensure that ssh public keys are set up and you can ssh from the =rsv= user on the RSV host to the remote server without needing to enter a password.
