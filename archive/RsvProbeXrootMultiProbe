---+ Description

This probe checks the following:
   * that the Xroot server is up and responding to its port
   * that a file can be copied directly from the server
   * that a file can be copied requesting it via a Federated Xroot Redirector

| *Metric* | *Test description* |
| org.osg.xroot.ping | Test a connection to the Xroot server on the Xroot port (1094 by default) |
| org.osg.xroot.grid-xrdcp-direct | Copy a file from the Xroot server |
| org.osg.xroot.grid-xrdcp-fxr | Copy a file via the Federated Xroot Redirector |
| org.osg.xroot.grid-xrdcp-compare | Copy a file directly from the server and via the FXR, then compare the two |
| org.atlas.xroot.xrdcp-direct | Copy an ATLAS test file from the Xroot server |
| org.atlas.xroot.xrdcp-fxr | Copy an ATLAS test file via the Federated Xroot Redirector |
| org.atlas.xroot.xrdcp-compare | Copy an ATLAS test file directly from the server and via the FXR, then compare the two |

---+ Manual invocation
This probe can be invoked manually.
It requires:
  * =rsvprobe.py=, providing the base class in Python for RSV Probes, in the PYTHONPATH or in the current directory  
  * optionally =timed_command.py= to be able to enforce timeouts
  * =xrdcp=, the xroot copy command, in the PATH 
  * optionally =xrdcp_small=, a modified version of xrdcp that copies only 1MB, in the PATH, else the --small option will be ignored

It accepts the following additional options:
| *Option* | *Description* |
| --test-file FILE | Remote test file to be used for testing (Default for ATLAS: /atlas/test/<host>-1M), required for non ATLAS tests |
| --destination-dir <dir> | Directory on local host to copy test file (Default: /tmp/) |
| --fxr URI | URI for the federated Xroot server. (Default: root://glrd.usatlas.org:1094/) |
| --small | Copy only the first 1MB of the test file |

To invoke manually: <pre class="screen">
$ ./xroot-multi-probe -m org.usatlas.xrootd.xrdcp-compare -u atlas29.hep.anl.gov --output-type wlcg

---+ Provided metrics
The remainder of this page is dedicated to explaining the failure modes of the this probe, and how you might try to resolve them.

---++ Metric org.osg.xroot.ping 
Test a connection to the Xroot server on the Xroot port (1094 by default) 

Failure modes of this metric:
   * *CRITICAL*: cannot connect to the Xroot server
      * the server is down or Xroot service is off
      * a Firewall is blocking the connection to port 1094 (or whichever alternative port)
   * *UNKNOWN*: wrong probe invocation
   * *WARNING*: 

---++ Metric org.osg.xroot.grid-xrdcp-direct 
Copy a file from the Xroot server 

Failure modes of this metric:
   * *CRITICAL*: cannot copy a file from the Xroot server
      * the server is down or Xroot service is off
      * a Firewall is blocking the connection to port 1094 (or whichever alternative port) of the Xroot server
      * the file is not there
      * xrdcp failed
   * *UNKNOWN*: 
      * wrong probe invocation (e.g. no file specified)
      * xrdcp not in the PATH
   * *WARNING*: 

---++ Metric org.osg.xroot.grid-xrdcp-fxr  
Copy a file via the Federated Xroot Redirector 

Failure modes of this metric:
   * *CRITICAL*: cannot copy a file from the Federated Xroot Redirector
      * the FXR is down or Xroot service is off
      * a Firewall is blocking the connection to port 1094 (or whichever alternative port) of the FXR (no direct connection to the Xroot server is done)
      * the file is not on the FXR (e.g. the FAX service is not running on the Xroot server and FXR cannot retrieve the file)
      * xrdcp failed
   * *UNKNOWN*: 
      * wrong probe invocation (e.g. no file specified)
      * xrdcp not in the PATH
   * *WARNING*: 

---++ Metric org.osg.xroot.grid-xrdcp-compare  
Copy a file directly from the server and via the FXR, then compare the two 

Failure modes of this metric:
   * *CRITICAL*: 
      * cannot copy a file from the Federated Xroot Redirector
         * the FXR is down or Xroot service is off
         * a Firewall is blocking the connection to port 1094 (or whichever alternative port) of the FXR (no direct connection to the Xroot server is done)
         * the file is not on the FXR (e.g. the FAX service is not running on the Xroot server and FXR cannot retrieve the file)
         * xrdcp failed
      *  cannot copy a file from the Xroot server
         * the server is down or Xroot service is off
         * a Firewall is blocking the connection to port 1094 (or whichever alternative port) of the Xroot server
         * the file is not there
         * xrdcp failed
      * the 2 files differ
   * *UNKNOWN*: 
      * wrong probe invocation (e.g. no file specified)
      * xrdcp not in the PATH
   * *WARNING*: 

---++ Metric org.atlas.xroot.xrdcp-direct, org.atlas.xroot.xrdcp-fxr, org.atlas.xroot.xrdcp-compare 
These metrics do the same tests of the similarly names metrics starting with "org.osg.xroot" but they use a default ATLAS test file that has a standard name and is placed in a standard path.

For failure modes see the corresponding "org.osg.xroot" metrics above.
