---+ Configuring HTCondor-CE for WLCG SAM tests

In order for WLCG SAM to test your HTCondor-CE, you must record an appropriate contact URL in OIM's service field.

For most sites, this is as simple as editing the resource's service list within OIM.  The URL format is:

<pre>
htcondor://$HOSTNAME:$PORT/$SCHEDDNAME?option1=val1&option2=val2
</pre>

A typical site will only need to specify the hostname and can otherwise use the defaults:

<pre>
htcondor://condorce.example.com
</pre>

Each piece of the URL is documented below:
   * *$HOSTNAME*: The hostname of the HTCondor-CE.  This should match the hostname on the CE's host certificate.
   * *$PORT*: The port the HTCondor-CE's collector listens on.  The default is 9619 (matching the default shipped configuration of the CE) and we advise sites to not change this.
   * *$SCHEDDNAME*: The name of the schedd in the HTCondor-CE.  The HTCondor default and the default here is to use the hostname.  We strongly advise sites not to change this and to use the default.
   * *option1=val1*: URL parameters are passed as !ClassAd attributes for the job submitted to the CE.  Use these only if you need to uniquely identify SAM jobs from other jobs at your site.  We recommend to avoid using these and use the FQAN attributes instead to distinguish SAM jobs.

The generated HTCondor-G submit file will have the following lines:

<pre>
grid_resource = condor $SCHEDDNAME $HOSTNAME:$PORT
remote_option1=val1
remote_option2=val2
</pre>

*NOTE* that =option1= here is a !ClassAd attribute in the remote ad, not a submit file command.  Similarly, =val1= should be a valid !ClassAd expression; make sure you use !ClassAd syntax (i.e., a string is ="foo"= not =foo=).
