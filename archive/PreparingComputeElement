---+ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for system administrators. It contains requirements that must be met and procedures completed before beginning the [[Documentation/Release3.InstallComputeElement][Compute Element Installation]]. 

---+ Before you Begin

   1. Read the [[Documentation.Release3.SitePlanning][Site Planning Guide]] and plan your site on paper.
   1. Make sure you are using a supported operating system: %SUPPORTED_OS%
   1. Verify the operation of your local batch system.
   1. Decide if your site will join the _Production Grid_ or the _Integration Testbed_ of the OSG.
   1. Know your CE's _resource name_ and _resource group_.  These are values that you filled out when you registered the site in [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu][OIM]]. If the CE is not registered yet, check the [[Operations.OIMRegistrationInstructions][OIM registration instructions]].
   1. Determine your site sponsors. These are the Virtual Organizations that own the computing resources behind the CE.

---+ Operating System and Networking Requirements

   * A working network connection
   * A fully qualified domain name for the gatekeeper
   * A working forward and reverse DNS lookup for the IP address of the gatekeeper
   * A valid host and several service certificates issued for the fully qualified domain name of the gatekeeper
   * Synchronized clocks using NTP for all resources constituting the Compute Element 
   * Outbound network connections, please review the [[Documentation/Release3.FirewallInformation][Firewall Document]]

---+ Required Service Accounts

| *Service Name*  | *Account*  | *Comment* |
| CEMon  | =tomcat=  | | 
| condor | =condor= | Only if you install Condor RPM |

---+ Required User Accounts

Unix user accounts need to be created for each %LINK_GLOSSARY_VO%. The =uid= and =name= of the account can be locally determined. You will be asked to provide a mapping from local accounts to VOs later during the [[InstallComputeElement#ConfigureCE][CE configuration process]].  Since VO's are frequently added to the OSG, you should access the current list of registered VO's at [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/vosummary?datasource=summary&all_vos=on&active_value=1][MyOSG's Virtual Organization menu item]]. Any new VO's will also appear in on the CE in the file =/etc//etc/osg/osg-user-vo-map.txt=.

---+ Required Host and Service Certificates

The following table lists OSG services that require a service certificate for their operation. Please [[Documentation/Release3.GetHostServiceCertificates][request and install]] the certificates before you proceed with the installation.

| *Purpose*  | *Default Location*  | *User that should own the certificate*  |
| !GridFTP/host  | =/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem= %BR% =/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem=  | =root=   |
| CEMon  | =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= %BR% =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem= | =tomcat=  |

Note: Please do not create the "tomcat" user yourself. This user will be created automatically when tomcat is installed as part of CE Installation procedure.

---+ Do you have a Grid User Certificate?

As the system administrator you are required to test the functionality provided by the Compute Element. This requires a [[CertificateUserGet][grid user certificate]] issued for you.
