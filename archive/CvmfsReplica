---# Description

cvmfsreplica is a tool to handle the process to running snapshots on a CVMFS Stratum-1 host. 
It is meant to be more flexible and complete than a simple cron job. 
The behavior of cvmfsreplica is driven by its configuration files. Therefore, it is recommended to read carefully the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/CvmfsReplicaReferenceManual][reference manual]] before starting the service. 
Each CVMFS repository is set separately in the configuration files. For each one of them, an internal thread will be created that loops uninterruptedly, triggering snapshot commands periodically. 
Besides triggering periodically a snapshot command, the service behavior can be modulated making use of the available plugins.

<tr>
    <td class="tg-raw31">Acceptance plugins</td>
    <td class="tg-raw32">
Acceptance plugins are used to decide, on every cycle, if the snapshot command should or not be attempted. 
None, one, or more than one acceptance plugins can be used. 
When they are used, the snapshot step is performed only if all of them passes successfully. 
Some acceptance plugin may also, when they don't pass, call a report plugin to notify the failure. 
Also, some acceptance plugin may stop that particular thread, so no more attempts will be performed for that particular repository.

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td class="tg-raw31">Report plugins</td>
    <td class="tg-raw32">
The Report plugins are meant to notify the relevant events during the replication process, mostly when something does not work as expected. 
 </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
    <td class="tg-raw31">Post plugins</td>
    <td class="tg-raw32">
The Post plugins perform actions after the snapshot have been attempted, either successfully or not.

---# Download

*WARNING: this is temporary until the RPMs are distributed from CERN*

<pre class="rootscreen">

---# Setup and configuration

The cvmfsreplica daemon works on top of an existing, properly configured, CVMFS Stratum-1. 
Documentation on how to setup and run a CVMFS Stratum-1, or replica server, can be found [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallCvmfsStratum1][here]], 
and also in the [[https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpt-replica.html][official CVMFS documentation]]

The details on how to setup and configure the cvmfsreplica are explained in the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/CvmfsReplicaReferenceManual][reference manual]]
