the site only needs to provide a SSH pubkey-based\n   authentication access to the central OSG host.\n   OSG will interface with the VO and submit pilots directly to your batch system via SSH.\n   By far, this is the \nsimplest option\n: however, it is less-scalable and the site delegates many of the scheduling\n   decisions to the OSG.\n   Contact \n for more information on the hosted CE.\n\n\nOSG CE\n: The traditional option where the site installs and operates a HTCondor-based CE on a dedicated host.\n   This provides the best scalability and flexibility, but may require an ongoing time investment from the site.\n   The OSG CE install and operation is covered in this documentation page.\n\n\n\n\nRuntime environment\n\n\nThe OSG requires a very minimal runtime environment that can be deployed via \ntarball\n,\n\nRPM\n, or through a \nglobal filesystem\n on your cluster's worker\nnodes.\n\n\nWe believe that all research applications should be portable and self-contained, with no OS dependencies.\nThis provides access to the most resources and minimizes the presence at sites.\nHowever, this ideal is often difficult to achieve in practice.\nFor sites that want to support a uniform runtime environment, we provide a global filesystem called\n\nCVMFS\n that VOs can use to distribute their own software dependencies.\n\n\nFinally, many researchers use applications that require a specific OS environment - not just individual dependencies -\nthat is distributed as a container.\nOSG supports the use of the \nSingularity\n container runtime with\n\nDocker-based\n image distribution.\n\n\nData Services\n\n\nWhether accessed through CVMFS or command-line software like \ncurl\n, the majority of software is moved via HTTP in\ncache-friendly patterns.\nAll sites are highly encouraged to use an \nHTTP proxy\n to reduce the load on the WAN from the\ncluster.\n\n\nDepending on the VOs you want to support, additional data services may be necessary:\n\n\n\n\nSome VOs elect to stream their larger input data from offsite using OSG's \"StashCache\" service.\n  This requires no services to be run by the site\n\n\nThe largest sites will additionally run large-scale data services such as a \"storage element\".\n  This is often required for sites that want to support more complex organizations such as ATLAS or CMS.\n\n\n\n\nSite Policies\n\n\nSites are encouraged to clearly specify and communicate their local policies regarding resource access.\nOne common mechanism to do this is post them on a web page and make this page part of your\n\nsite registration\n.\nWritten policies help external entities understand what your site wants to accomplish with the OSG -- and are often\ninternally clarifying.\n\n\nIn line of our principle of \nsharing\n, we encourage you to allow virtual organizations registered with the OSG\n\"opportunistic use\" of your resources.\nYou may need to preempt those jobs when higher priority jobs come around.\nThe end-users using the OSG generally prefer having access to your site subject to preemption over having no access\nat all.",

            "text": "HTCondor-CE Overview\n\n\nThis document serves as an introduction to HTCondor-CE and how it works.\nBefore continuing with the overview, make sure that you are familiar with the following concepts:\n\n\n\n\nAn OSG site plan\n\n\nWhat is a batch system and which one will you use (\nHTCondor\n, PBS, LSF, SGE, or\n    \nSLURM\n)?\n\n\nSecurity in the OSG via \nGSI\n (i.e.,\n    \nCertificate authorities\n, user and host\n    \ncertificates\n, proxies)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPilot jobs, frontends, and factories (i.e., \nGlideinWMS\n,\n    AutoPyFactory)\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Compute Element?\n\n\nAn OSG Compute Element (CE) is the entry point for the OSG to your local resources: a layer of software that you install\non a machine that can submit jobs into your local batch system.\nAt the heart of the CE is the \njob gateway\n software, which is responsible for handling incoming jobs, authenticating\nand authorizing them, and delegating them to your batch system for execution.\n\n\nToday in the OSG, most jobs that arrive at a CE (called \ngrid jobs\n) are \nnot\n end-user jobs, but rather pilot jobs\nsubmitted from factories.\nSuccessful pilot jobs create and make available an environment for actual end-user jobs to match and ultimately run\nwithin the pilot job container.\nEventually pilot jobs remove themselves, typically after a period of inactivity.\n\n\nWhat is HTCondor-CE?\n\n\nHTCondor-CE is a special configuration of the HTCondor software designed to be a job gateway solution for the OSG.\nIt is configured to use the \nJobRouter daemon\n to\ndelegate jobs by transforming and submitting them to the site\u2019s batch system.\n\n\nBenefits of running the HTCondor-CE:\n\n\n\n\nScalability:\n HTCondor-CE is capable of supporting job workloads of large sites\n\n\nDebugging tools:\n HTCondor-CE offers \nmany tools to help troubleshoot\n\n    issues with jobs\n\n\nRouting as configuration:\n HTCondor-CE\u2019s mechanism to transform and submit jobs is customized via configuration\n    variables, which means that customizations will persist across upgrades and will not involve modification of\n    software internals to route jobs\n\n\n\n\nHow Jobs Run\n\n\nOnce an incoming grid job is authorized, it is placed into HTCondor-CE\u2019s scheduler where the JobRouter creates a\ntransformed copy (called the \nrouted job\n) and submits the copy to the batch system (called the \nbatch system job\n).\nAfter submission, HTCondor-CE monitors the batch system job and communicates its status to the original grid job, which\nin turn notifies the original submitter (e.g., job factory) of any updates.\nWhen the job completes, files are transferred along the same chain: from the batch system to the CE, then from the CE to\nthe original submitter.\n\n\nHosted HTCondor-CE over SSH\n\n\nThe hosted HTCondor-CE is intended for small sites or as an introduction to the OSG.\nThe OSG configures and maintains the HTCondor-CE on behalf of the site.\nThe hosted HTCondor-CE is a special configuration of HTCondor-CE that can submit jobs to a remote cluster over SSH.\nIt provides a simple starting point for opportunistic resource owners that want to start contributing to the OSG with\nminimal effort: an organization will be able to accept OSG jobs by allowing SSH access to a submit node in their cluster.\n\n\nIf your site intends to run thousands of OSG jobs, you will need to host a standard\n\nHTCondor-CE\n because the hosted HTCondor-CE has not yet been optimized for such\nloads.\n\n\nTo discuss using a hosted SSH HTCondor-CE, contact OSG User Support at\n\nuser-support@opensciencegrid.org\n.\n\n\n\n\nOn HTCondor batch systems\n\n\nFor a site with an HTCondor \nbatch system\n, the JobRouter can use HTCondor protocols to place a transformed copy of\nthe grid job directly into the batch system\u2019s scheduler, meaning that the routed and batch system jobs are one and the\nsame.\nThus, there are three representations of your job, each with its own ID (see diagram below):\n\n\n\n\nSubmit host: the HTCondor job ID in the original queue\n\n\nHTCondor-CE: the incoming grid job\u2019s ID\n\n\nHTCondor batch system: the routed job\u2019s ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an HTCondor-CE/HTCondor setup, files are transferred from HTCondor-CE\u2019s spool directory to the batch system\u2019s spool\ndirectory using internal HTCondor protocols.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe JobRouter copies the job directly into the batch system and does not make use of \ncondor_submit\n.\nThis means that if the HTCondor batch system is configured to add attributes to incoming jobs when they are\nsubmitted (i.e., \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n), these attributes will not be added to the routed jobs.\n\n\n\n\nOn other batch systems\n\n\nFor non-HTCondor batch systems, the JobRouter transforms the grid job into a routed job on the CE and the routed job\nsubmits a job into the batch system via a process called the BLAHP.\nThus, there are four representations of your job, each with its own ID (see diagram below):\n\n\n\n\nSubmit host: the HTCondor job ID in the original queue\n\n\nHTCondor-CE: the incoming grid job\u2019s ID and the routed job\u2019s ID\n\n\nHTCondor batch system: the batch system\u2019s job ID\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the following figure specifies the PBS case, it applies to all non-HTCondor batch systems:\n\n\n\n\nWith non-HTCondor batch systems, HTCondor-CE cannot use internal HTCondor protocols to transfer files so its spool\ndirectory must be exported to a shared file system that is mounted on the batch system\u2019s worker nodes.\n\n\nHow the CE is Customized\n\n\nAside from the \nbasic configuration\n required in the CE\ninstallation, there are two main ways to customize your CE (if you decide any customization is required at all):\n\n\n\n\nDeciding which VOs are allowed to run at your site:\n The recommended method of authorizing VOs at your site is\n    based on the \nLCMAPS framework\n\n\nHow to filter and transform the grid jobs to be run on your batch system:\n Filtering and transforming grid jobs\n    (i.e., setting site-specific attributes or resource limits), requires configuration of your site\u2019s job routes.\n    For examples of common job routes, consult the \nJobRouter recipes\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are running HTCondor as your batch system, you will have two HTCondor configurations side-by-side (one\nresiding in \n/etc/condor/\n and the other in \n/etc/condor-ce\n) and will need to make sure to differentiate the two\nwhen editing any configuration.\n\n\n\n\nHow Security Works\n\n\nIn the OSG, security depends on a PKI infrastructure involving Certificate Authorities (CAs) where CAs sign and issue\ncertificates.\nWhen these clients and hosts wish to communicate with each other, the identities of each party is confirmed by\ncross-checking their certificates with the signing CA and establishing trust.\n\n\nIn its default configuration, HTCondor-CE uses GSI-based authentication and authorization to verify the certificate\nchain, which will work with \nLCMAPS VOMS authentication\n.\nAdditionally, it can be reconfigured to provide alternate authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos, SSL, shared\nsecret, or even IP-based authentication.\nMore information about authorization methods can be found\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nNext steps\n\n\nOnce the basic installation is done, additional activities include:\n\n\n\n\nSetting up job routes to customize incoming jobs\n\n\nSubmitting jobs to a HTCondor-CE\n \n\n\nTroubleshooting the HTCondor-CE\n\n\nRegister the CE with OIM\n\n\nRegister with the OSG GlideinWMS factories and/or the ATLAS AutoPyFactory",

coming from the OSG \u2014 it handles authorization and delegation of jobs\nto your local batch system.\nIn OSG today, most CEs accept \npilot jobs\n from a factory, which in turn are able to accept and run end-user jobs.\nSee the \nHTCondor-CE Overview\n for a much more detailed introduction.\n\n\nUse this page to learn how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot HTCondor-CE from the OSG software\nrepositories.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points\n(consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux users \ncondor\n (UID 4716) and\n    \ngratia\n (UID 42401)\n\n\nSSL certificate:\n The HTCondor-CE service uses a host certificate at \n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n and an\n    accompanying key at \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\nDNS entries:\n Forward and reverse DNS must resolve for the HTCondor-CE host\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n The pilot factories must be able to contact your HTCondor-CE service on port 9619 (TCP)\n\n\nSubmit host:\n HTCondor-CE should be installed on a host that already has the ability to submit jobs into your\n    local cluster\n\n\nFile Systems:\n We recommend separate partitions for the \njob queue log\n and\n    \nSPOOL\n directory.\n    Additionally, non-HTCondor batch systems require a \nshared file system\n between\n    the HTCondor-CE host and the batch system worker nodes.\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling HTCondor-CE\n\n\nAn HTCondor-CE installation consists of the job gateway (i.e., the HTCondor-CE job router) and other support software\n(e.g., GridFTP, a Gratia probe, authentication software).\nTo simplify installation, OSG provides convenience RPMs that install all required software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will update \nall\n packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Optional)\n If your batch system is already installed via non-RPM means and is in the following list, install the\n   appropriate 'empty' RPM.\n   Otherwise, skip to the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your batch system is\u2026\n\n\nThen run the following command\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor\n\n\nyum install empty-condor --enablerepo=osg-empty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSLURM\n\n\nyum install empty-slurm

Otherwise, skip to the next step.\n\n\nexclude=condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the appropriate convenience RPM:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your batch system is...\n\n\nThen use the following

batch system and authentication method.\nFor more advanced configuration, see the section on \noptional configurations\n.\n\n\nConfiguring the batch system\n\n\nEnable your batch system by editing the \nenabled\n field in the \n/etc/osg/config.d/20-\nYOUR BATCH SYSTEM\n.ini\n\n\nenabled = \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using HTCondor as your \nlocal batch system\n (i.e., in addition to your HTCondor-CE), skip to the\n\nconfiguring authorization\n section.\nFor other batch systems (e.g., PBS, LSF, SGE, SLURM), keep reading.\n\n\nBatch systems other than HTCondor\n\n\nNon-HTCondor batch systems require a shared file system configuration to support file transfer from the HTCondor-CE to\nyour site's worker nodes.\nThe current recommendation is to run a dedicated NFS server (whose installation is beyond the scope of this document) on\nthe \nCE host\n.\nIn this setup, HTCondor-CE writes to the local spool directory, the NFS server shares the directory, and each worker\nnode mounts the directory in the same location as on the CE.\nFor example, if your spool directory is \n/var/lib/condor-ce\n (the default), you must mount the shared directory to\n\n/var/lib/condor-ce\n on the worker nodes.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you choose not to host the NFS server on your CE, you will need to turn off root squash so that the HTCondor-CE\ndaemons can write to the spool directory.\n\n\n\n\nYou can control the value of the spool directory by setting \nSPOOL\n in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n (create\nthis file if it doesn't exist).\nFor example, the following sets the \nSPOOL\n directory to \n/home/condor\n:\n\n\nSPOOL = /home/condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe shared spool directory must be readable and writeable by the \ncondor\n user for HTCondor-CE to function correctly.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the job queue location\n\n\nThe \njob queue log\n is a frequently written\nto file that contains the state of the HTCondor-CE job queue.\nFor performance reasons, we recommend storing this file and the \nSPOOL\n directory on a different file system partitions.\nTo configure the location of the job queue log:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind which file system partition your \nSPOOL\n directory is located on:\n\n\nuser@htcondor-ce $\n df \n$(\ncondor_ce_config_val SPOOL\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet \nJOB_QUEUE_LOG\n in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n to the path of the job queue log on a separate file\n   system partition than the above.\n   For example, if you have a separate SSD that is mounted on \n/ssd\n, you could set the following:\n\n\nJOB_QUEUE_LOG = /ssd/condor/job_queue.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring authorization\n\n\nTo configure which virtual organizations and users are authorized to submit jobs to your, follow the instructions in\n\nthe LCMAPS VOMS plugin document\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf your local batch system is HTCondor, it will attempt to utilize the LCMAPS callouts if enabled in the\n\ncondor_mapfile\n.\nIf this is not the desired behavior, set \nGSI_AUTHZ_CONF=/dev/null\n in the local HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring CE collector advertising\n\n\nTo split jobs between the various sites of the OSG, information about each site's capabilities are uploaded to a central\ncollector.\nThe job factories then query the central collector for idle resources and submit pilot jobs to the available sites.\nTo advertise your site, you will need to enter some information about the worker nodes of your clusters.\n\n\nPlease see the \nSubcluster / Resource Entry configuration document\n\nabout configuring the data that will be uploaded to the central collector.\n\n\nApplying configuration settings\n\n\nMaking changes to the OSG configuration files in the \n/etc/osg/config.d\n directory does not apply those settings to\nsoftware automatically.\nSettings that are made outside of the OSG directory take effect immediately or at least when the relevant service is\nrestarted.\nFor the OSG settings, use the \nosg-configure\n tool to validate (to a limited\nextent) and apply the settings to the relevant software components.\nThe \nosg-configure\n software is included automatically in an HTCondor-CE installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake all changes to \n.ini\n files in the \n/etc/osg/config.d\n directory\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis document describes the critical settings for HTCondor-CE and related software.\nYou may need to configure other software that is installed on your HTCondor-CE host, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidate the configuration settings\n\n\nroot@host #\n osg-configure -v\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFix any errors (at least) that \nosg-configure\n reports.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the validation command succeeds without errors, apply the configuration settings:\nroot@host #\n osg-configure -c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional configuration\n\n\nThe following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be required for setting up a small site.\nIf you do not need any of the following special configurations, skip to\n\nthe section on using HTCondor-CE\n.\n\n\n\n\nTransforming and filtering jobs\n\n\nConfiguring for multiple network interfaces\n\n\nLimiting or disabling locally running jobs on the CE\n\n\nAccounting with multiple CEs or local user jobs\n\n\nHTCondor accounting groups\n\n\nHTCondor-CE monitoring web interface\n\n\n\n\nTransforming and filtering jobs\n\n\nIf you need to modify or filter jobs, more information can be found in the \nJob Router Recipes\n\ndocument.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you need to assign jobs to HTCondor accounting groups, refer to \nthis\n section.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring for multiple network interfaces\n\n\nIf you have multiple network interfaces with different hostnames, the HTCondor-CE daemons need to know which hostname\nand interface to use when communicating to each other.\nSet \nNETWORK_HOSTNAME\n and \nNETWORK_INTERFACE\n to the hostname and IP address of your public interface, respectively, in\n\n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n directory with the line:\n\n\nNETWORK_HOSTNAME = \ncondorce.example.com\n\nNETWORK_INTERFACE = \n127.0.0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n text with your public interface\u2019s hostname and \n127.0.0.1\n with your public interface\u2019s\nIP address.\n\n\nLimiting or disabling locally running jobs on the CE\n\n\nIf you want to limit or disable jobs running locally on your CE, you will need to configure HTCondor-CE's local and\nscheduler universes.\nLocal and scheduler universes allow jobs to be run on the CE itself, mainly for remote troubleshooting.\nPilot jobs will not run as local/scheduler universe jobs so leaving them enabled does NOT turn your CE into another\nworker node.\n\n\nThe two universes are effectively the same (scheduler universe launches a starter process for each job), so we will be\nconfiguring them in unison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the default limit\n on the number of locally run jobs (the current default is 20), add the following to\n  \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE\n \n=\n TotalLocalJobsRunning + TotalSchedulerJobsRunning \nlt\n;\n \nlt\n;\nJOB-LIMIT\ngt\n;\n\n\nSTART_SCHEDULER_UNIVERSE\n \n=\n \n$(\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo only allow a specific user\n to start locally run jobs, add the following to\n  \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE\n \n=\n target.Owner \n=\n?\n=\n \nlt;USERNAME\ngt;\n\n\nSTART_SCHEDULER_UNIVERSE\n \n=\n \n$(\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo disable\n locally run jobs, add the following to \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE\n \n=\n False\n\nSTART_SCHEDULER_UNIVERSE\n \n=\n \n$(\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nRSV requires the ability to start local universe jobs so if you are using RSV, you need to allow local universe jobs\nfrom the \nrsv\n user.\n\n\n\n\nAccounting with multiple CEs or local user jobs\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor non-HTCondor batch systems only\n\n\n\n\nIf your site has multiple CEs or you have non-grid users submitting to the same local batch system, the OSG accounting\nsoftware needs to be configured so that it doesn't over report the number of jobs.\nUse the following table to determine which file requires editing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your batch system is\u2026\n\n\nThen edit the following file on your CE(s)\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLSF\n\n\n/etc/gratia/pbs-lsf/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS\n\n\n/etc/gratia/pbs-lsf/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSGE\n\n\n/etc/gratia/sge/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSLURM\n\n\n/etc/gratia/slurm/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen edit the value of \nSuppressNoDNRecords\n so that it reads:\n\n\nSuppressNoDNRecords=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor accounting groups\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor HTCondor batch systems only\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to provide fairshare on a group basis, as opposed to a Unix user basis, you can use HTCondor accounting groups.\nThey are independent of the Unix groups the user may already be in and are \ndocumented in the HTCondor manual\n.\nIf you are using HTCondor accounting groups, you can map jobs from the CE into HTCondor accounting groups based on their\nUID, their DN, or their VOMS attributes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo map UIDs to an accounting group,\n add entries to \n/etc/osg/uid_table.txt\n with the following form:\n\n\nuid GroupName\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an example \nuid_table.txt\n:\n\n\nuscms02 TestGroup\nosg     other.osgedu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo map DNs or VOMS attributes to an accounting group,\n add lines to \n/etc/osg/extattr_table.txt\n with the\n    following form:\n\n\nSubjectOrAttribute\n GroupName\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nSubjectOrAttribute\n can be a Perl regular expression. The following is an example \nextattr_table.txt\n:\n\n\ncmsprio cms.other.prio\ncms\\/Role=production cms.prod\n\\/DC=com\\/DC=DigiCert-Grid\\/O=Open\\ Science\\ Grid\\/OU=People\\/CN=Brian\\ Lin\\ 1047 osg.test\n.* other\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nEntries in \n/etc/osg/uid_table.txt\n are honored over \n/etc/osg/extattr_table.txt\n if a job would match to lines in\nboth files.\n\n\n\n\nInstall and run the HTCondor-CE View\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE View is an optional web interface to the status of your CE. To run the View,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin by installing the package htcondor-ce-view:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install htcondor-ce-view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, uncomment the \nDAEMON_LIST\n configuration located at \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/05-ce-view.conf\n:\n\n\nDAEMON_LIST\n \n=\n \n$(\nDAEMON_LIST\n)\n, CEVIEW, GANGLIAD, SCHEDD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the CE service:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service condor-ce restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the service by entering your CE's hostname into your web browser\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe website is served on port 80 by default. To change this default, edit the value of \nHTCONDORCE_VIEW_PORT\n in\n\n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/05-ce-view.conf\n.\n\n\nUsing HTCondor-CE\n\n\nAs a site administrator, there are a few ways to use the HTCondor-CE:\n\n\n\n\nManaging the HTCondor-CE and associated services\n\n\nUsing HTCondor-CE administrative tools to monitor and maintain the job gateway\n\n\nUsing HTCondor-CE user tools to test gateway operations\n\n\n\n\nManaging HTCondor-CE and associated services\n\n\nIn addition to the HTCondor-CE job gateway service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation.\nThe specific services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch CRL\n\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n and \nfetch-crl-cron\n\n\nSee \nCA documentation\n for more info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGratia\n\n\ngratia-probes-cron\n\n\nAccounting software\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour batch system\n\n\ncondor\n or \npbs_server\n or \u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE\n\n\ncondor-ce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the services in the order listed and stop them in reverse order.

Customizations are made in the form of job routes where each route corresponds to a separate job transformation: If an incoming job matches a job route's requirements, the route creates a transformed job (referred to as the 'routed job') that is then submitted to the batch system. The CE package comes with default routes located in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-*.conf\n that provide enough basic functionality for a small site.\n\n\nIf you have needs beyond delegating all incoming jobs to your batch system as they are, this document provides examples of common job routes and job route problems.\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncoming Job\n: A job which was submitted to the CE from an outside source, such as a GlideinWMS Factory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRouted Job\n: A job which was transformed by the JobRouter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatch System\n: The underlying batch system that the HTCondor-CE will submit.  This can be Slurm, PBS, HTCondor, SGE, LSF,...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuirks and Pitfalls\n\n\n\n\nThe JobRouter matches jobs to routes in a round-robin fashion (for HTCondor versions \n 8.7.1). This means that if a job can match to multiple routes, it can be routed by any of them! So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.\n\n\nIf a value is set in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n with \neval_set_\nvariable\n, override it by using \neval_set_\nvariable\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n. Do this at your own risk as it may cause the CE to break.\n\n\nMake sure to run \ncondor_ce_reconfig\n after changing your routes, otherwise they will not take effect.\n\n\nBefore the last square bracket, make sure all lines end in a line continuation character (backslash). You can inspect the syntax of your routes with \ncondor_ce_config_val JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n to see if HTCondor-CE has ingested them properly.\n\n\nDo \nnot\n set the job environment through the JobRouter. Instead, add any changes to the \n[Local Settings]\n section in \n/etc/osg/config.d/40-localsettings.ini\n and run osg-configure, as documented \nhere\n.\n\n\nHTCondor batch system only: Local universe jobs are excluded from any routing.\n\n\n\n\nHow Job Routes are Constructed\n\n\nEach job route\u2019s \nClassAd\n is constructed by combining each entry from the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n with the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n. Attributes that are \nset_*\n in \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n will override those \nset_*\n in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n is a configuration variable whose default is set in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-*.conf\n but may be overriden by the administrator in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n. This document outlines the many changes you can make to \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n to fit your site\u2019s needs.\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n is a python-generated configuration variable that sets default job route values that are required for the HTCondor-CE's functionality. To view its contents in a readable format, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS \n|\n sed \ns/;/;\\n/g\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf a value is set in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n with \neval_set_\nvariable\n, override it by using \neval_set_\nvariable\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n. Do this at your own risk as it may cause the CE to break.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nDo \nnot\n set the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n configuration variable yourself. This will cause the CE to stop functioning.\n\n\n\n\nGeneric Routes\n\n\nThis section contains general information about job routes that can be used regardless of the type of batch system at your site. New routes should be placed in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n, not the original \n02-ce-*.conf\n.\n\n\nRequired fields\n\n\nThe minimum requirements for a route are that you specify the type of batch system that jobs should be routed to and a name for each route. Default routes can be found in \n/usr/share/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-\nbatch system\n-defaults.conf\n, provided by the \nosg-ce-\nbatch system\n packages.\n\n\nBatch system\n\n\nEach route needs to indicate the type of batch system that jobs should be routed to. For HTCondor batch systems, the \nTargetUniverse\n attribute needs to be set to \n5\n or \n\"vanilla\"\n. For all other batch systems, the \nTargetUniverse\n attribute needs to be set to \n9\n or \n\"grid\"\n and the \nGridResource\n attribute needs to be set to \n\"batch \nbatch system\n\"\n (where \nbatch system\n can be one of \npbs\n, \nslurm\n, \nlsf\n, or \nsge\n).\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     \nTargetUniverse = 5; \\\n\n     name = \nRoute jobs to HTCondor\n; \\\n] \\\n[ \\\n     \nGridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n\n     \nTargetUniverse = 9; \\\n\n     name = \nRoute jobs to PBS\n; \\\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nRoute name\n\n\nTo identify routes, you will need to assign a name to the route with the \nname\n attribute:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     \nname = \nRoute jobs to HTCondor\n; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the route will be useful in debugging since it shows up in the output of \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n, the \nJobRouterLog\n, and in the ClassAd of the routed job, which can be viewed with \ncondor_ce_q\n or \ncondor_ce_history\n.\n\n\nWriting multiple routes\n\n\nIf your batch system needs incoming jobs to be sorted (e.g. if different VO's need to go to separate queues), you will need to write multiple job routes. Each route is enclosed by square brackets and unless they're the last closing bracket, they need to be followed by the line continuation character. The following routes takes incoming jobs that have a \nqueue\n attribute set to \n\"analy\"\n and routes them to the site's HTCondor batch system. Any other jobs will be sent to that site's PBS batch system.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor versions of HTCondor \n 8.7.1, the JobRouter matches jobs to routes in a round-robin fashion. This means that if a job can match to multiple routes, it can be routed by any of them! So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.\n\n\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = \n[ \\\n\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nRoute jobs to HTCondor\n; \\\n     Requirements = (TARGET.queue =?= \nanaly\n); \\\n\n] \\\n[ \\\n\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nRoute jobs to PBS\n; \\\n     Requirements = (TARGET.queue =!= \nanaly\n); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting comments\n\n\nTo write comments you can use C-style comments, text enclosed by \n/* */\n. If the comment is at the end of a line, it still has to be followed by the line continuation character.\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nC-style comments\n; \\\n     \n/* This is a comment */ \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use \n#\n to comment out single lines:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nHash comments\n; \\\n     \n# BrokenAttribute = \ncommented out\n; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting attributes for all routes\n\n\nTo set an attribute that will be applied to all routes, you will need to ensure that \nMERGE_JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULT_ADS\n is set to \nTrue\n (check the value with \ncondor_ce_config_val\n) and use the \nset_\n function in the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n. The following configuration sets the \nPeriodic_Hold\n attribute for all routes:\n\n\n# Use the defaults generated by the condor_ce_router_defaults script.  To add\n\n\n# additional defaults, add additional lines of the form:\n\n\n#\n\n\n#   JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS = $(JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS) [set_foo = 1;]\n\n\n#\n\n\nMERGE_JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULT_ADS\n=\nTrue\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n \n=\n \n$(\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n)\n \n[\nset_Periodic_Hold\n \n=\n \n(\nNumJobStarts \n=\n \n1\n \n \nJobStatus\n \n==\n \n1\n)\n \n||\n NumJobStarts \n \n1\n;\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering jobs based on\u2026\n\n\nTo filter jobs, use the \nRequirements\n attribute. Jobs will evaluate against the ClassAd expression set in the \nRequirements\n and if the expression evaluates to \nTRUE\n, the route will match. More information on the syntax of ClassAd's can be found in the \nHTCondor manual\n. For an example on how incoming jobs interact with filtering in job routes, consult \nthis document\n.\n\n\nWhen setting requirements, you need to prefix job attributes that you are filtering with \nTARGET.\n so that the job route knows to compare the attribute of the incoming job rather than the route\u2019s own attribute. For example, if an incoming job has a \nqueue = \"analy\"\n attribute, then the following job route will not match:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by queue\n; \\\n     queue = \nnot-analy\n; \\\n     \nRequirements = (queue =?= \nanaly\n); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is because when evaluating the route requirement, the job route will compare its own \nqueue\n attribute to \"analy\" and see that it does not match. You can read more about comparing two ClassAds in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you have an HTCondor batch system, note the difference with \nset_requirements\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\nFor versions of HTCondor \n 8.7.1, the JobRouter matches jobs to routes in a round-robin fashion. This means that if a job can match to multiple routes, it can be routed by any of them! So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlidein queue\n\n\nTo filter jobs based on their glidein queue attribute, your routes will need a \nRequirements\n expression using the incoming job's \nqueue\n attribute. The following entry routes jobs to PBS if the incoming job (specified by \nTARGET\n) is an \nanaly\n (Analysis) glidein:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by queue\n; \\\n     \nRequirements = (TARGET.queue =?= \nanaly\n); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nJob submitter\n\n\nTo filter jobs based on who submitted it, your routes will need a \nRequirements\n expression using the incoming job's \nOwner\n attribute. The following entry routes jobs to the HTCondor batch system if the submitter is \nusatlas2\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by job submitter\n; \\\n     \nRequirements = (TARGET.Owner =?= \nusatlas2\n); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can match based on regular expression. The following entry routes jobs to the PBS batch system if the submitter's name begins with \nusatlas\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by job submitter (regular expression)\n; \\\n     \nRequirements = regexp(\n^usatlas\n, TARGET.Owner); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nVOMS attribute\n\n\nTo filter jobs based on the subject of the job's proxy, your routes will need a \nRequirements\n expression using the incoming job's \nx509UserProxyFirstFQAN\n attribute. The following entry routes jobs to the PBS batch system if the proxy subject contains \n/cms/Role=Pilot\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by VOMS attribute (regex)\n; \\\n     \nRequirements = regexp(\n\\/cms\\/Role\\=pilot\n, TARGET.x509UserProxyFirstFQAN); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting a default\u2026\n\n\nThis section outlines how to set default job limits, memory, cores, and maximum walltime. For an example on how users can override these defaults, consult \nthis document\n.\n\n\nMaximum number of jobs\n\n\nTo set a default limit to the maximum number of jobs per route, you can edit the configuration variable \nCONDORCE_MAX_JOBS\n in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/01-ce-router.conf\n:\n\n\nCONDORCE_MAX_JOBS = 10000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe above configuration is to be placed directly into the HTCondor-CE configuration, not into a job route.\n\n\n\n\nMaximum memory\n\n\nTo set a default maximum memory for routed jobs, set the attribute \ndefault_maxMemory\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nRequest memory\n; \\\n     /* Set the requested memory to 1 GB */ \\\n     \nset_default_maxMemory = 1000; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of cores to request\n\n\nTo set a default number of cores for routed jobs, set the attribute \ndefault_xcount\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nRequest CPU\n; \\\n     /* Set the requested cores to 8 */ \\\n     \nset_default_xcount = 8; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum walltime\n\n\nTo set a default maximum walltime (in minutes) for routed jobs, set the attribute \ndefault_maxWallTime\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nSetting WallTime\n; \\\n     /* Set the max walltime to 1 hr */ \\\n     \nset_default_maxWallTime = 60; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nEditing attributes\u2026\n\n\nThe following functions are operations that affect job attributes and are evaluated in the following order:\n\n\n\n\ncopy_*\n\n\ndelete_*\n\n\nset_*\n\n\neval_set_*\n\n\n\n\nAfter each job route\u2019s ClassAd is \nconstructed\n, the above operations are evaluated in order. For example, if the attribute \nfoo\n is set using \neval_set_foo\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n, you'll be unable to use \ndelete_foo\n to remove it from your jobs since the attribute is set using \neval_set_foo\n after the deletion occurs according to the order of operations. To get around this, we can take advantage of the fact that operations defined in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n get overridden by the same operation in \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n. So to 'delete' \nfoo\n, we would add \neval_set_foo = \"\"\n to the route in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n, resulting in \nfoo\n being absent from the routed job.\n\n\nMore documentation can be found in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\nCopying attributes\n\n\nTo copy the value of an attribute of the incoming job to an attribute of the routed job, use \ncopy_\n. The following route copies the \nenvironment\n attribute of the incoming job and sets the attribute \nOriginal_Environment\n on the routed job to the same value:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nCopying attributes\n; \\\n     \ncopy_environment = \nOriginal_Environment\n; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving attributes\n\n\nTo remove an attribute of the incoming job from the routed job, use \ndelete_\n. The following route removes the \nenvironment\n attribute from the routed job:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nCopying attributes\n; \\\n     \ndelete_environment = True; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting attributes\n\n\nTo set an attribute on the routed job, use \nset_\n. The following route sets the Job's \nRank\n attribute to 5:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nSetting an attribute\n; \\\n     \nset_Rank = 5; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting attributes with ClassAd expressions\n\n\nTo set an attribute to a ClassAd expression to be evaluated, use \neval_set\n. The following route sets the \nExperiment\n attribute to \natlas.osguser\n if the Owner of the incoming job is \nosguser\n:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf a value is set in JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS with \neval_set_\nvariable\n, override it by using \neval_set_\nvariable\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n.\n\n\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nSetting an attribute with a !ClassAd expression\n; \\\n     \neval_set_Experiment = strcat(\natlas.\n, Owner); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nLimiting the number of jobs\n\n\nThis section outlines how to limit the number of total or idle jobs in a specific route (i.e., if this limit is reached, jobs will no longer be placed in this route).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are using an HTCondor batch system, limiting the number of jobs is not the preferred solution: HTCondor manages fair share on its own via \nuser priorities and group accounting\n.\n\n\n\n\nTotal jobs\n\n\nTo set a limit on the number of jobs for a specific route, set the \nMaxJobs\n attribute:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nLimit the total number of jobs to 100\n; \\\n     \nMaxJobs = 100; \\\n\n] \\\n[ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nLimit the total number of jobs to 75\n; \\\n     \nMaxJobs = 75; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nIdle jobs\n\n\nTo set a limit on the number of idle jobs for a specific route, set the \nMaxIdleJobs\n attribute:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nLimit the total number of idle jobs to 100\n; \\\n     \nMaxIdleJobs = 100; \\\n\n] \\\n[ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nLimit the total number of idle jobs to 75\n; \\\n     \nMaxIdleJobs = 75; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugging routes\n\n\nTo help debug expressions in your routes, you can use the \ndebug()\n function. First, set the debug mode for the JobRouter by editing a file in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/\n to read\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG\n\n\n\n\n\nThen wrap the problematic attribute in \ndebug()\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nDebugging a difficult !ClassAd expression\n; \\\n     \neval_set_Experiment = debug(strcat(\natlas\n, Name)); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will find the debugging output in \n/var/log/condor-ce/JobRouterLog\n.\n\n\nRoutes for HTCondor Batch Systems\n\n\nThis section contains information about job routes that can be used if you are running an HTCondor batch system at your site.\n\n\nSetting periodic hold, release or remove\n\n\nTo release, remove or put a job on hold if it meets certain criteria, use the \nPERIODIC_*\n family of attributes. By default, periodic expressions are evaluated once every 300 seconds but this can be changed by setting \nPERIODIC_EXPR_INTERVAL\n in your CE's configuration.\n\n\nIn this example, we set the routed job on hold if the job is idle and has been started at least once or if the job has tried to start more than once.  This will catch jobs which are starting and stopping multiple times.\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nSetting periodic statements\n; \\\n     \n/* Puts the routed job on hold if the job\ns been idle and has been started at least once or if the job has tried to start more than once */ \\\n     set_Periodic_Hold = (NumJobStarts \n= 1 \n JobStatus == 1) || NumJobStarts \n 1; \\\n     /* Remove routed jobs if their walltime is longer than 3 days and 5 minutes */ \\\n     set_Periodic_Remove = ( RemoteWallClockTime \n (3*24*60*60 + 5*60) ); \\\n     /* Release routed jobs if the condor_starter couldn\nt start the executable and \nVMGAHP_ERR_INTERNAL\n is in the HoldReason */ \\\n     set_Periodic_Release = HoldReasonCode == 6 \n regexp(\nVMGAHP_ERR_INTERNAL\n, HoldReason); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting routed job requirements\n\n\nIf you need to set requirements on your routed job, you will need to use \nset_Requirements\n instead of \nRequirements\n. The \nRequirements\n attribute filters jobs coming into your CE into different job routes whereas \nset_Requirements\n will set conditions on the routed job that must be met by the worker node it lands on. For more information on requirements, consult the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\nTo ensure that your job lands on a Linux machine in your pool:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     \nset_Requirements =  OpSys == \nLINUX\n; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting accounting groups\n\n\nTo assign jobs to an HTCondor accounting group to manage fair share on your local batch system, we recommend using \nUID and ExtAttr tables\n.\n\n\nRoutes for non-HTCondor Batch Systems\n\n\nThis section contains information about job routes that can be used if you are running a non-HTCondor batch system at your site.\n\n\nSetting a default batch queue\n\n\nTo set a default queue for routed jobs, set the attribute \ndefault_queue\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nSetting batch system queues\n; \\\n     \nset_default_queue = \nosg_queue\n; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting batch system directives\n\n\nTo write batch system directives that are not supported in the route examples above, you will need to edit the job submit script for your local batch system in \n/etc/blahp/\n (e.g., if your local batch system is PBS, edit \n/etc/blahp/pbs_local_submit_attributes.sh\n). This file is sourced during submit time and anything printed to stdout is appended to the batch system job submit script. ClassAd attributes can be passed from the routed job to the local submit attributes script via the \ndefault_remote_cerequirements\n attribute, which can take the following form:\n\n\ndefault_remote_cerequirements = \nfoo == X \n bar == \\\nY\\\n \n ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sets \nfoo\n to value \nX\n and \nbar\n to the string \nY\n (escaped double-quotes are required for string values) in the environment of the local submit attributes script. The following example sets the maximum walltime to 1 hour and the accounting group to the \nx509UserProxyFirstFQAN\n attribute of the job submitted to a PBS batch system\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nSetting job submit variables\n; \\\n     \nset_default_remote_cerequirements = strcat(\nWalltime == 3600 \n AccountingGroup == \\\n, x509UserProxyFirstFQAN, \n\\\n); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nWith \n/etc/blahp/pbs_local_submit_attributes.sh\n containing.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\necho\n \n#PBS -l walltime=\n$Walltime\n\n\necho\n \n#PBS -A \n$AccountingGroup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in the following being appended to the script that gets submitted to your batch system:\n\n\n#PBS -l walltime=3600\n#PBS -A \nCE job\ns x509UserProxyFirstFQAN attribute\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\n\nHere are some other HTCondor-CE documents that might be helpful:\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE overview and architecture\n\n\nInstalling HTCondor-CE\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE troubleshooting guide\n\n\nSubmitting jobs to HTCondor-CE\n\n\n\n\nExample Configurations\n\n\nAGLT2's job routes\n\n\nAtlas AGLT2 is using an HTCondor batch system. Here are some things to note about their routes.\n\n\n\n\nSetting various HTCondor-specific attributes like \nRank\n, \nAccountingGroup\n, \nJobPrio\n and \nPeriodic_Remove\n (see the \nHTCondor manual\n for more). Some of these are site-specific like \nLastandFrac\n, \nIdleMP8Pressure\n, \nlocalQue\n, \nIsAnalyJob\n and \nJobMemoryLimit\n.\n\n\nThere is a difference between \nRequirements\n and \nset_requirements\n. The \nRequirements\n attribute matches jobs to specific routes while the \nset_requirements\n sets the \nRequirements\n attribute on the \nrouted\n job, which confines which machines that the routed job can land on.\n\n\n\n\nSource: \nhttps://www.aglt2.org/wiki/bin/view/AGLT2/CondorCE#The_JobRouter_configuration_file_content\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n \n=\n \n\\\n\n/* Still to \ndo\n on all

Some of these are site-specific like \nRACF_Group\n, \nExperiment\n, \nJob_Type\n and \nVO\n.\n\n\nJobs are split into different routes based on the \nGlideIn\n queue that they're in.\n\n\nThere is a difference between \nRequirements\n and \nset_requirements\n. The \nRequirements\n attribute matches \nincoming\n jobs to specific routes while the \nset_requirements\n sets the \nRequirements\n attribute on the \nrouted\n job, which confines which machines that the routed job can land on.\n\n\n\n\nSource: \nhttp://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/view/Admins/HTCondorCE.html\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n \n=\n \n\\\n\n   \n[\n \n\\\n\n     \nGridResource\n \n=\n \ncondor localhost localhost\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \neval_set_GridResource\n \n=\n strcat\n(\ncondor \n, \n$(\nFULL_HOSTNAME\n)\n, \n$(\nFULL_HOSTNAME\n)\n)\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nTargetUniverse\n \n=\n \n5\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nname\n \n=\n \nBNL_Condor_Pool_long\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nRequirements\n \n=\n target.queue\n==\nanalysis.long\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \neval_set_RACF_Group\n \n=\n \nlong\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_Experiment\n \n=\n \natlas\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_requirements\n \n=\n \n(\n \n(\n \nArch\n \n==\n \nINTEL\n \n||\n \nArch\n \n==\n \nX86_64\n \n)\n \n \n(\n \nCPU_Experiment\n \n==\n \natlas\n \n)\n \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.OpSys \n==\n \nLINUX\n \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.Disk \n=\n RequestDisk \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.Memory \n=\n RequestMemory \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.HasFileTransfer \n)\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_Job_Type\n \n=\n \ncas\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_JobLeaseDuration\n \n=\n \n3600\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_Periodic_Hold\n \n=\n \n(\nNumJobStarts \n=\n \n1\n \n \nJobStatus\n \n==\n \n1\n)\n \n||\n NumJobStarts \n \n1\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \neval_set_VO\n \n=\n x509UserProxyVOName\n;\n \n\\\n\n   \n]\n \n\\\n\n   \n[\n \n\\\n\n     \nGridResource\n \n=\n \ncondor localhost localhost\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \neval_set_GridResource\n \n=\n strcat\n(\ncondor \n, \n$(\nFULL_HOSTNAME\n)\n, \n$(\nFULL_HOSTNAME\n)\n)\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nTargetUniverse\n \n=\n \n5\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nname\n \n=\n \nBNL_Condor_Pool_short\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nRequirements\n \n=\n target.queue\n==\nanalysis.short\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \neval_set_RACF_Group\n \n=\n \nshort\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_Experiment\n \n=\n \natlas\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_requirements\n \n=\n \n(\n \n(\n \nArch\n \n==\n \nINTEL\n \n||\n \nArch\n \n==\n \nX86_64\n \n)\n \n \n(\n \nCPU_Experiment\n \n==\n \natlas\n \n)\n \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.OpSys \n==\n \nLINUX\n \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.Disk \n=\n RequestDisk \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.Memory \n=\n RequestMemory \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.HasFileTransfer \n)\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_Job_Type\n \n=\n \ncas\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_JobLeaseDuration\n \n=\n \n3600\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_Periodic_Hold\n \n=\n \n(\nNumJobStarts \n=\n \n1\n \n \nJobStatus\n \n==\n \n1\n)\n \n||\n NumJobStarts \n \n1\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \neval_set_VO\n \n=\n x509UserProxyVOName\n;\n \n\\\n\n   \n]\n \n\\\n\n   \n[\n \n\\\n\n     \nGridResource\n \n=\n \ncondor localhost localhost\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \neval_set_GridResource\n \n=\n strcat\n(\ncondor \n, \n$(\nFULL_HOSTNAME\n)\n, \n$(\nFULL_HOSTNAME\n)\n)\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nTargetUniverse\n \n=\n \n5\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nname\n \n=\n \nBNL_Condor_Pool_grid\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nRequirements\n \n=\n target.queue\n==\ngrid\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \neval_set_RACF_Group\n \n=\n \ngrid\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_Experiment\n \n=\n \natlas\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_requirements\n \n=\n \n(\n \n(\n \nArch\n \n==\n \nINTEL\n \n||\n \nArch\n \n==\n \nX86_64\n \n)\n \n \n(\n \nCPU_Experiment\n \n==\n \natlas\n \n)\n \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.OpSys \n==\n \nLINUX\n \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.Disk \n=\n RequestDisk \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.Memory \n=\n RequestMemory \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.HasFileTransfer \n)\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_Job_Type\n \n=\n \ncas\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_JobLeaseDuration\n \n=\n \n3600\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_Periodic_Hold\n \n=\n \n(\nNumJobStarts \n=\n \n1\n \n \nJobStatus\n \n==\n \n1\n)\n \n||\n NumJobStarts \n \n1\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \neval_set_VO\n \n=\n x509UserProxyVOName\n;\n \n\\\n\n   \n]\n \n\\\n\n   \n[\n \n\\\n\n     \nGridResource\n \n=\n \ncondor localhost localhost\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \neval_set_GridResource\n \n=\n strcat\n(\ncondor \n, \n$(\nFULL_HOSTNAME\n)\n, \n$(\nFULL_HOSTNAME\n)\n)\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nTargetUniverse\n \n=\n \n5\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nname\n \n=\n \nBNL_Condor_Pool\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nRequirements\n \n=\n target.queue is undefined\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \neval_set_RACF_Group\n \n=\n \ngrid\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_requirements\n \n=\n \n(\n \n(\n \nArch\n \n==\n \nINTEL\n \n||\n \nArch\n \n==\n \nX86_64\n \n)\n \n \n(\n \nCPU_Experiment\n \n==\n \nrcf\n \n)\n \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.OpSys \n==\n \nLINUX\n \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.Disk \n=\n RequestDisk \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.Memory \n=\n RequestMemory \n)\n \n \n(\n TARGET.HasFileTransfer \n)\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_Experiment\n \n=\n \natlas\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_Job_Type\n \n=\n \ncas\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_JobLeaseDuration\n \n=\n \n3600\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \nset_Periodic_Hold\n \n=\n \n(\nNumJobStarts \n=\n \n1\n \n \nJobStatus\n \n==\n \n1\n)\n \n||\n NumJobStarts \n \n1\n;\n \n\\\n\n     \neval_set_VO\n \n=\n x509UserProxyVOName\n;\n \n\\\n\n   \n]",

            "text": "The  JobRouter  is at the heart of HTCondor-CE and allows admins to transform and direct jobs to specific batch systems. Customizations are made in the form of job routes where each route corresponds to a separate job transformation: If an incoming job matches a job route's requirements, the route creates a transformed job (referred to as the 'routed job') that is then submitted to the batch system. The CE package comes with default routes located in  /etc/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-*.conf  that provide enough basic functionality for a small site.  If you have needs beyond delegating all incoming jobs to your batch system as they are, this document provides examples of common job routes and job route problems.   Definitions    Incoming Job : A job which was submitted to the CE from an outside source, such as a GlideinWMS Factory.    Routed Job : A job which was transformed by the JobRouter.    Batch System : The underlying batch system that the HTCondor-CE will submit.  This can be Slurm, PBS, HTCondor, SGE, LSF,...",

Here are some things to note about their routes:   Setting various HTCondor-specific attributes like  JobLeaseDuration ,  Requirements  and  Periodic_Hold  (see the  HTCondor manual  for more). Some of these are site-specific like  RACF_Group ,  Experiment ,  Job_Type  and  VO .  Jobs are split into different routes based on the  GlideIn  queue that they're in.  There is a difference between  Requirements  and  set_requirements . The  Requirements  attribute matches  incoming  jobs to specific routes while the  set_requirements  sets the  Requirements  attribute on the  routed  job, which confines which machines that the routed job can land on.

            "text": "HTCondor-CE Troubleshooting Guide\n\n\nIn this document, you will find a collection of files and commands to help troubleshoot HTCondor-CE along with a list of\ncommon issues with suggested troubleshooting steps.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS are not applied to jobs on the local HTCondor\n\n\nIf you are adding attributes to jobs submitted to your HTCondor pool with \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n, these will \nnot\n be applied to\njobs that are entering your pool from the HTCondor-CE. \nTo get around this, you will want to add the attributes to your \njob routes\n. \nIf the CE is the only entry point for jobs into your pool, you can get rid of \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n on your backend. Otherwise,\nyou will have to maintain your list of attributes both in your list of routes and in your \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n.\n\n\nGeneral Troubleshooting Items\n\n\nMaking sure packages are up-to-date\n\n\nIt is important to make sure that the HTCondor-CE and related RPMs are up-to-date.\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update \nhtcondor-ce*\n blahp condor\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you just want to see the packages to update, but do not want to perform the update now, answer \nN\n at the prompt.\n\n\nVerify package contents\n\n\nIf the contents of your HTCondor-CE packages have been changed, the CE may cease to function properly. To verify the\ncontents of your packages (ignoring changes to configuration files):\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -q --verify htcondor-ce htcondor-ce-client blahp \n|\n grep -v \n/var/\n \n|\n awk \n$2 != \nc\n {print $0}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the verification command returns output, this means that your packages have been changed. To fix this, you can\nreinstall the packages:\n\n\nuser@host $\n yum reinstall htcondor-ce htcondor-ce-client blahp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe reinstall command may place original versions of configuration files alongside the versions that you have modified. If this is the case, the reinstall command will notify you that the original versions will have an \n.rpmnew\n suffix. Further inspection of these files may be required as to whether or not you need to merge them into your current configuration.\n\n\n\n\nVerify clocks are synchronized\n\n\nLike all GSI-based authentication, HTCondor-CE is sensitive to time skews. Make sure the clock on your CE is\nsynchronized using a utility such as \nntpd\n. \nAdditionally, HTCondor itself is sensitive to time skews on the NFS server.\nIf you see empty stdout / err being returned to the submitter, verify there is no NFS server time skew.\n\n\nVerify host cerificates and CRLs are valid\n\n\nAn expired host certificate or CRLs will cause various issues with GSI authentication. \nVerify that your host certificate is valid by running:\n\n\nroot@host #\n openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -noout -dates\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, run the \nfetch-crl\n script to update your CRLs:\n\n\nroot@host #\n fetch-crl\n\n\n\n\n\nIf updating CRLs fix your issues, make sure that the \nfetch-crl-cron\n and\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n services are enabled and running.\n\n\nHTCondor-CE Troubleshooting Items\n\n\nThis section contains common issues you may encounter using HTCondor-CE and next actions to take when you do. \nBefore troubleshooting, we recommend increasing the log level:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite the following into \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n to increase the log level for all daemons:\n\n\nALL_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG D_CAT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that the configuration is in place:\n\n\nroot@host # condor_ce_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproduce the issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBefore spending any time on troubleshooting, you should ensure that the state of configuration is as expected by running \ncondor_ce_reconfig\n.\n\n\n\n\nDaemons fail to start\n\n\nIf there are errors in your configuration of HTCondor-CE, this may cause some of its required daemons to fail to\nstartup. \nCheck the following subsections in order:\n\n\nSymptoms\n\n\nDaemon startup failure may manifest in many ways, the following are few symptoms of the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service fails to start:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service condor-ce start\n\nStarting Condor-CE daemons: [ FAIL ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n fails with a lengthy error message:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q\n\nError:\n\n\n\nExtra Info: You probably saw this error because the condor_schedd is not running\n\n\non the machine you are trying to query. If the condor_schedd is not running, the\n\n\nCondor system will not be able to find an address and port to connect to and\n\n\nsatisfy this request. Please make sure the Condor daemons are running and try\n\n\nagain.\n\n\n\nExtra Info: If the condor_schedd is running on the machine you are trying to\n\n\nquery and you still see the error, the most likely cause is that you have setup\n\n\na personal Condor, you have not defined SCHEDD_NAME in your condor_config file,\n\n\nand something is wrong with your SCHEDD_ADDRESS_FILE setting. You must define\n\n\neither or both of those settings in your config file, or you must use the -name\n\n\noption to condor_q. Please see the Condor manual for details on SCHEDD_NAME and\n\n\nSCHEDD_ADDRESS_FILE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nIf the MasterLog is filled with \nERROR:SECMAN...TCP connection to collector...failed\n:\n This is likely due to a misconfiguration for a host with multiple network interfaces. Verify that you have followed the instructions in \nthis\n section of the install guide.\n\n\nIf the MasterLog is filled with \nDC_AUTHENTICATE\n errors:\n The HTCondor-CE daemons use the host certificate to authenticate with each other. Verify that your host certificate\u2019s DN matches one of the regular expressions found in \n/etc/condor-ce/condor_mapfile\n.\n\n\nIf the SchedLog is filled with \nCan\u2019t find address for negotiator\n:\n You can ignore this error! The negotiator daemon is used in HTCondor batch systems to match jobs with resources but since HTCondor-CE does not manage any resources directly, it does not run one.\n\n\n\n\nJobs fail to submit to the CE\n\n\nIf a user is having issues submitting jobs to the CE and you've ruled out general connectivity or firewalls as the\nculprit, then you may have encountered an authentication or authorization issue. \nYou may see error messages like the following in your \nSchedLog\n:\n\n\n08/30/16 16:52:56 DC_AUTHENTICATE: required authentication of 72.33.0.189 failed: AUTHENTICATE:1003:Failed to authenticate with any method|AUTHENTICATE:1004:Failed to authenticate using GSI|GSI:5002:Failed to authenticate because the remote (client) side was not able to acquire its credentials.|AUTHENTICATE:1004:Failed to authenticate using FS|FS:1004:Unable to lstat(/tmp/FS_XXXZpUlYa)\n08/30/16 16:53:12 PERMISSION DENIED to gsi@unmapped from host 72.33.0.189 for command 60021 (DC_NOP_WRITE), access level WRITE: reason: WRITE authorization policy contains no matching ALLOW entry for this request; identifiers used for this host: 72.33.0.189,dyn-72-33-0-189.uwnet.wisc.edu, hostname size = 1, original ip address = 72.33.0.189\n08/30/16 16:53:12 DC_AUTHENTICATE: Command not authorized, done!\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nCheck GUMS or grid-mapfile\n and ensure that the user's DN is known to your \nauthentication method\n\n\nCheck for lcmaps errors\n in \n/var/log/messages\n\n\nIf you do not see helpful error messages in \n/var/log/messages\n,\n adjust the debug level by adding \nexport LCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL=5\n to \n/etc/sysconfig/condor-ce\n, restarting the condor-ce service, and checking \n/var/log/messages\n for errors again.\n\n\n\n\nJobs stay idle on the CE\n\n\nCheck the following subsections in order, but note that jobs may take several minutes or longer to run if the CE is\nbusy.\n\n\nIdle jobs on CE: Is the job router handling the incoming job?\n\n\nJobs on the CE will be put on hold if they do not match any job routes after 30 minutes, but you can check a few things\nif you suspect that the jobs are not being matched. \nCheck if the JobRouter sees a job before that by looking at the \njob router log\n and looking for the text\n\nsrc=\nJOB-ID\n\u2026claimed job\n.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n to see why your idle job does not match any routes\n\n\nIdle jobs on CE: Verify correct operation between the CE and your local batch system\n\n\nFor HTCondor batch systems\n\n\nHTCondor-CE submits jobs directly to an HTCondor batch system via the JobRouter, so any issues with the CE/local batch\nsystem interaction will appear in the \nJobRouterLog\n.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nCheck the \nJobRouterLog\n for failures.\n\n\nVerify that the local HTCondor is functional.\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_config_val\n to verify that the \nJOB_ROUTER_SCHEDD2_NAME\n, \nJOB_ROUTER_SCHEDD2_POOL\n, and \nJOB_ROUTER_SCHEDD2_SPOOL\n configuration variables are set to the hostname of your CE, the hostname and port of your local HTCondor\u2019s collector, and the location of your local HTCondor\u2019s spool directory, respectively.\n\n\nUse \ncondor_config_val QUEUE_SUPER_USER_MAY_IMPERSONATE\n and verify that it is set to \n.*\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor non-HTCondor batch systems\n\n\nHTCondor-CE submits jobs to a non-HTCondor batch system via the Gridmanager, so any issues with the CE/local batch\nsystem interaction will appear in the \nGridmanagerLog\n. \nLook for \ngm state change\u2026\n lines to figure out where the issures are occuring.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nIf you see failures in the GridmanagerLog during job submission:\n Save the submit files by adding the appropriate entry to \nblah.config\n and submit it \nmanually\n to the batch system. If that succeeds, make sure that the BLAHP knows where your binaries are located by setting the \nbatch system\n_binpath\n in \n/etc/blah.config\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you see failures in the GridmanagerLog during queries for job status:\n Query the resultant job with your batch system tools from the CE. If you can, the BLAHP uses scripts to query for status in \n/usr/libexec/blahp/\nbatch system\n_status.sh\n (e.g., \n/usr/libexec/blahp/lsf_status.sh\n) that take the argument \nbatch system/YYYMMDD/job ID\n (e.g., \nlsf/20141008/65053\n). Run the appropriate status script for your batch system and upon success, you should see the following output:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /usr/libexec/blahp/lsf_status.sh lsf/20141008/65053\n\n[ BatchjobId = \n894862\n; JobStatus = 4; ExitCode = 0; WorkerNode = \natl-prod08\n ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the script fails, \nrequest help\n from the OSG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdle jobs on CE: Make sure the underlying batch system can run jobs\n\n\nHTCondor-CE communicates directly with an HTCondor batch system schedd, so if jobs are not running, examine the\n\nSchedLog\n and diagnose the problem from there. \nFor other batch systems, the BLAHP is used to submit jobs using your batch system\u2019s job submission binaries, whose\nlocation is specified in \n/etc/blah.config\n.\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\nManually create and submit a simple job (e.g., one that runs \nsleep\n)\n\n\nCheck for errors in the submission itself\n\n\nWatch the job in the batch system queue (e.g., using \ncondor_q\n)\n\n\nIf the job does not run, check for errors on the batch system\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\nIf the underlying batch system does not run a simple manual job, it will probably not run a job coming from HTCondor-CE.\nOnce you can run simple manual jobs on your batch system, try submitting to the HTCondor-CE again.\n\n\nIdle jobs on CE: Verify ability to change permissions on key files\n\n\nHTCondor-CE needs the ability to write and chown files in its \nspool\n directory and if it cannot, jobs will not run at\nall. \nSpool permission errors can appear in the \nSchedLog\n and the \nJobRouterLog\n.\n\n\nSymptoms\n\n\n09/17/14 14:45:42 Error: Unable to chown \n/var/lib/condor-ce/spool/1/0/cluster1.proc0.subproc0/env\n from 12345 to 54321\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nAs root, try to change ownership of the file or directory in question. If the file does not exist, a parent directory may have improper permissions.\n\n\nVerify that there aren't any underlying file system issues in the specified location\n\n\n\n\nJobs stay idle on a remote host submitting to the CE\n\n\nIf you are submitting your job from a separate submit host to the CE, it stays idle in the queue forever, and you do not\nsee a resultant job in the CE's queue, this means that your job cannot contact the CE for submission or it is not\nauthorized to run there. \nNote that jobs may take several minutes or longer if the CE is busy.\n\n\nRemote idle jobs: Can you contact the CE?\n\n\nTo check basic connectivity to a CE, use \ncondor_ce_ping\n:\n\n\nSymptoms\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ping -verbose -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 WRITE\n\nERROR: couldn\nt locate condorce.example.com!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the HTCondor-CE daemons are running with \ncondor_ce_status\n.\n\n\nVerify that your CE is reachable from your submit host, replacing \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of your CE:\nuser@host $\n ping condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote idle jobs: Are you authorized to run jobs on the CE?\n\n\nThe CE will only accept jobs from users that authenticate via LCMAPS, grid mapfile, or GUMS. \nYou can use \ncondor_ce_ping\n to check if you are authorized and what user your

actions\n\n\n\n\nVerify that an \nauthentication method\n is set up on the CE\n\n\nVerify that your user DN is mapped to an existing system user\n\n\n\n\nJobs go on hold\n\n\nJobs will be put on held with a \nHoldReason\n attribute that can be inspected with \ncondor_ce_q\n:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -l \nJOB-ID\n -attr HoldReason\n\nHoldReason = \nCE job in status 5 put on hold by SYSTEM_PERIODIC_HOLD due to no matching routes, route job limit, or route failure threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeld jobs: no matching routes, route job limit, or route failure threshold\n\n\nJobs on the CE will be put on hold if they are not claimed by the job router within 30 minutes.\nThe most common cases for this behavior are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe job does not match any job routes:\n\n  use \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n to see why your idle job does not match any\n  \nroutes\n.\n\n\nThe route(s) that the job matches to are full:\n\n  See \nlimiting the number of jobs\n.\n\n\nThe job router is throttling submission to your batch system due to submission failures:\n\n  See the HTCondor manual for \nFailureRateThreshold\n.\n  Check for errors in the \nJobRouterLog\n or \nGridmanagerLog\n for HTCondor and\n  non-HTCondor batch systems, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nHeld jobs: Missing/expired user proxy\n\n\nHTCondor-CE requires a valid user proxy for each job that is submitted. \nYou can check the status of your proxy with the following\n\n\nuser@host $\n voms-proxy-info -all\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\nEnsure that the owner of the job generates their proxy with \nvoms-proxy-init\n.\n\n\nHeld jobs: Invalid job universe\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE only accepts jobs that have \nuniverse\n in their submit files set to \nvanilla\n, \nstandard\n, \nlocal\n, or\n\nscheduler\n. \nThese universes also have corresponding integer values that can be found in the \nHTCondor\nmanual\n.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nEnsure jobs submitted locally, from the CE host, are submitted with \nuniverse = vanilla\n\n\n\n\nEnsure jobs submitted from a remote submit point are submitted with:\n\n\nuniverse = grid\ngrid_resource = condor condorce.example.com condorce.example.com:9619\n\n\n\n\n\nreplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying the corresponding job ID on the local batch system\n\n\nWhen troubleshooting interactions between your CE and your local batch system, you will need to associate the CE job ID\nand the resultant job ID on the batch system. \nThe methods for finding the resultant job ID differs between batch systems.\n\n\nHTCondor batch systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect the CE\u2019s job ad, use \ncondor_ce_q\n or \ncondor_ce_history\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_q\n

removed from the local HTCondor pool become resubmitted (HTCondor batch systems only)\n\n\nBy design, HTCondor-CE will resubmit jobs that have been removed from the underlying HTCondor pool. \nTherefore, to remove misbehaving jobs, they will need to be removed on the CE level following these steps:\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the misbehaving job ID in your batch system queue\n\n\n\n\nFind the job's

HTCondor tools\n\n\nMost of the HTCondor-CE tools are just wrappers around existing HTCondor tools that load the CE-specific config. \nIf you are trying to use HTCondor-CE tools and you see the following error:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_job_router_info\n\n/usr/bin/condor_ce_job_router_info: line 6: exec: condor_job_router_info: not found\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that the \ncondor_job_router_info\n (note this is not the CE version), is not in your \nPATH\n.\n\n\nNext Actions\n\n\n\n\nEither the condor RPM is missing or there are some other issues with it (try \nrpm --verify condor\n).\n\n\nYou have installed HTCondor in a non-standard location that is not in your \nPATH\n.\n\n\nThe \ncondor_job_router_info\n tool itself wasn't available until Condor-8.2.3-1.1 (available in osg-upcoming).\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE Troubleshooting Tools\n\n\nHTCondor-CE has its own separate set of of the HTCondor tools with \nce\n in the name (i.e., \ncondor_ce_submit\n vs\n\ncondor_submit\n). \nSome of the the commands are only for the CE (e.g., \ncondor_ce_run\n and \ncondor_ce_trace\n) but many of them are just\nHTCondor commands configured to interact with the CE (e.g., \ncondor_ce_q\n, \ncondor_ce_status\n). \nIt is important to differentiate the two: \ncondor_ce_config_val\n will provide configuration values for your HTCondor-CE\nwhile\n\ncondor_config_val\n will provide configuration values for your HTCondor batch system. \nIf you are not running an HTCondor batch system, the non-CE commands will return errors.\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n\n\nUsage\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n is a useful tool for testing end-to-end job submission. It contacts both the CE\u2019s Schedd and Collector daemons to verify your permission to submit to the CE, displays the submit script that it submits to the CE, and tracks the resultant job.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou must have generated a proxy (e.g., \nvoms-proxy-init\n) and your DN must be added to your \nchosen authentication method\n.\n\n\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_trace condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing the \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE. \nIf you are familiar with the output of condor commands, the command also takes a \n--debug\n option that displays verbose\ncondor output.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nIf the command fails with \u201cFailed ping\u2026\u201d:\n Make sure that the HTCondor-CE daemons are running on the CE\n\n\nIf you see \u201cgsi@unmapped\u201d in the \u201cRemote Mapping\u201d line:\n Either your credentials are not mapped on the CE or authentication is not set up at all. To set up authentication, refer to our \ninstallation document\n.\n\n\nIf the job submits but does not complete:\n Look at the status of the job and perform the relevant \ntroubleshooting steps\n.\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_host_network_check\n\n\nUsage\n\n\ncondor_ce_host_network_check\n is a tool for testing an HTCondor-CE's networking configuration:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_host_network_check\n\nStarting analysis of host networking for HTCondor-CE\n\n\nSystem hostname: fermicloud360.fnal.gov\n\n\nFQDN matches hostname\n\n\nForward resolution of hostname fermicloud360.fnal.gov is 131.225.155.96.\n\n\nBackward resolution of IPv4 131.225.155.96 is fermicloud360.fnal.gov.\n\n\nForward and backward resolution match!\n\n\nHTCondor is considering all network interfaces and addresses.\n\n\nHTCondor would pick address of 131.225.155.96 as primary address.\n\n\nHTCondor primary address 131.225.155.96 matches system preferred address.\n\n\nHost network configuration should work with HTCondor-CE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf the tool reports that \nHost network configuration not expected to work with HTCondor-CE\n, ensure that forward and\nreverse DNS resolution return the public IP and hostname.\n\n\ncondor_ce_run\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nSimilar to \nglobus-job-run\n, \ncondor_ce_run\n is a tool that submits a simple job to your CE, so it is useful for quickly\nsubmitting jobs through your CE. \nTo submit a job to the CE and run the \nenv\n command on the remote batch system:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou must have generated a proxy (e.g., \nvoms-proxy-init\n) and your DN must be added to your \nchosen authentication method\n.\n\n\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_run -r condorce.example.com:9619 /bin/env\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing the \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE. \nIf you are troubleshooting an HTCondor-CE that you do not have a login for and the CE accepts local universe jobs, you\ncan run commands locally on the CE with \ncondor_ce_run\n with the \n-l\n option. \nThe following example outputs the JobRouterLog of the CE in question:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_run -lr condorce.example.com:9619 cat /var/log/condor-ce/JobRouterLog\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing the \ncondorce.example.com\n text with the hostname of the CE. \nTo disable this feature on your CE, consult\n\nthis\n section of the install documentation.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not see any results:\n \ncondor_ce_run\n does not display results until the job completes on the CE, which may take several minutes or longer if the CE is busy. In the meantime, can use \ncondor_ce_q\n in a separate terminal to track the job on the CE. If you never see any results, use \ncondor_ce_trace\n to pinpoint errors.\n\n\nIf you see an error message that begins with \u201cFailed to\u2026\u201d:\n Check connectivity to the CE with \ncondor_ce_trace\n or \ncondor_ce_ping\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_submit\n\n\nSee the \nsubmitting to HTCondor-CE\n document for details.\n\n\ncondor_ce_ping\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nUse the following \ncondor_ce_ping\n command to test your ability to submit jobs to an HTCondor-CE, replacing\n\ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of your CE:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_ping -verbose -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 WRITE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following shows successful output where I am able to submit jobs (\nAuthorized: TRUE\n) as the glow user (\nRemote\nMapping: glow@users.opensciencegrid.org\n):\n\n\nRemote Version:              $CondorVersion: 8.0.7 Sep 24 2014 $\n\n\nLocal  Version:              $CondorVersion: 8.0.7 Sep 24 2014 $\n\n\nSession ID:                  condorce:27407:1412286981:3\n\n\nInstruction:                 WRITE\n\n\nCommand:                     60021\n\n\nEncryption:                  none\n\n\nIntegrity:                   MD5\n\n\nAuthenticated using:         GSI\n\n\nAll authentication methods:  GSI\n\n\nRemote Mapping:              glow@users.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\nAuthorized:                  TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you run the \ncondor_ce_ping\n command on the CE that you are testing, omit the \n-name\n and \n-pool\n options. \ncondor_ce_ping\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_ping\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see \u201cERROR: couldn\u2019t locate (null)\u201d\n, that means the HTCondor-CE schedd (the daemon that schedules jobs) cannot be reached. To track down the issue, increase debugging levels on the CE:\n\n\nMASTER_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG D_CAT\nSCHEDD_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG D_CAT\n\n\n\n\n\nThen look in the \nMasterLog\n and \nSchedLog\n for any errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see \u201cgsi@unmapped\u201d in the \u201cRemote Mapping\u201d line\n, this means that either your credentials are not mapped on the CE or that authentication is not set up at all. To set up authentication, refer to our \ninstallation document\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n\n\nUsage\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n can display job status or specific job attributes for jobs that are still in the CE\u2019s queue. To list jobs that are queued on a CE:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect the full ClassAd for a specific job, specify the \n-l\n flag and the job ID:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 -l \nJOB-ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you run the \ncondor_ce_q\n command on the CE that you are testing, omit the \n-name\n and \n-pool\n options. \ncondor_ce_q\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_q\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf the jobs that you are submiting to a CE are not completing, \ncondor_ce_q\n can tell you the status of your jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the schedd is not running:\n You will see a lengthy message about being unable to contact the schedd. To track down the issue, increase the debugging levels on the CE with:\n\n\nMASTER_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG D_CAT\nSCHEDD_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG D_CAT\n\n\n\n\n\nTo apply these changes, reconfigure HTCondor-CE:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\nThen look in the \nMasterLog\n and \nSchedLog\n on the CE for any errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are issues with contacting the collector:\n You will see the following message:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -pool ce1.accre.vanderbilt.edu -name ce1.accre.vanderbilt.edu\n\n\n-- Failed to fetch ads from: \nlt;129.59.197.223:9620?sock`33630_8b33_4\ngt; : ce1.accre.vanderbilt.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may be due to network issues or bad HTCondor daemon permissions. To fix the latter issue, ensure that the \nALLOW_READ\n configuration value is not set:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val -v ALLOW_READ\n\nNot defined: ALLOW_READ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it is defined, remove it from the file that is returned in the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a job is held:\n There should be an accompanying \nHoldReason\n that will tell you why it is being held. The \nHoldReason\n is in the job\u2019s ClassAd, so you can use the long form of \ncondor_ce_q\n to extract its value:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 -l \nlt\n;\nJob ID\ngt\n;\n \n|\n grep HoldReason\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a job is idle:\n The most common cause is that it is not matching any routes in the CE\u2019s job router. To find out whether this is the case, use the \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_history\n\n\nUsage\n\n\ncondor_ce_history\n can display job status or specific job attributes for jobs that have that have left the CE\u2019s queue. To list jobs that have run on the CE:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_history -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect the full ClassAd for a specific job, specify the \n-l\n flag and the job ID:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_history -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 -l \nJob ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you run the \ncondor_ce_history\n command on the CE that you are testing, omit the \n-name\n and \n-pool\n options. \ncondor_ce_history\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_history\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nUse the \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n command to help troubleshoot your routes and how jobs will match to them. \nTo see all of your routes (the output is long because it combines your routes with the\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n configuration variable):\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_job_router_info -config\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see how the job router is handling a job that is currently in the CE\u2019s queue, analyze the output of \ncondor_ce_q\n\n(replace the \nJOB-ID\n with the job ID that you are interested in):\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_q -l \nJOB-ID\n \n|\n condor_ce_job_router_info -match-jobs -ignore-prior-routing -jobads -\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect a job that has already left the queue, use \ncondor_ce_history\n instead of \ncondor_ce_q\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_history -l \nJOB-ID\n \n|\n condor_ce_job_router_info -match-jobs -ignore-prior-routing -jobads -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the proxy for the job has expired, the job will not match any routes.

This message means that, when compared to your job\u2019s ClassAd, the Umbrella constraint does not evaluate to \ntrue\n. When troubleshooting, look at all of the expressions prior to the \ntarget.ProcId \n= 0\n expression, because it and everything following it is logic that the job router added so that routed jobs do not get routed again.\n\n\n\n\nIf your job matches more than one route:\n the tool will tell you by showing all matching routes after the job ID:\n\n\nChecking Job src=162,0 against all routes\nRoute Matches: Local_PBS\nRoute Matches: Condor_Test\n\n\n\n\n\nTo troubleshoot why this is occuring, look at the combined Requirements expressions for all routes and compare it to the job\u2019s ClassAd provided.

Make sure your routes are mutually exclusive, otherwise you may have jobs routed incorrectly! See the \njob route configuration page\n for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it is unclear why jobs are matching a route:\n wrap the route's requirements expression in \ndebug()\n and check the \nJobRouterLog\n for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_router_q\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nIf you have multiple job routes and many jobs, \ncondor_ce_router_q\n is a useful tool to see how jobs are being routed\nand their statuses:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_router_q\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_router_q\n takes the same options as \ncondor_router_q\n and \ncondor_q\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor\nmanual\n\n\ncondor_ce_status\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo see the daemons running on a CE, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_status -any\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_status\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_status\n, which are documented in the\n\nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\n\"Missing\" Worker Nodes\n\n\nAn HTCondor-CE will not show any worker nodes (e.g. \nMachine\n entries in the \ncondor_ce_status -any\n output) if\nit does not have any running GlideinWMS pilot jobs.\nThis is expected since HTCondor-CE only forwards incoming grid jobs to your batch system and does not match jobs to\nworker nodes.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf the output of \ncondor_ce_status -any\n does not show at least the following daemons:\n\n\n\n\nCollector\n\n\nScheduler\n\n\nDaemonMaster\n\n\nJob_Router\n\n\n\n\nIncrease the \ndebug level\n and consult the\n\nHTCondor-CE logs\n for errors.\n\n\ncondor_ce_config_val\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo see the value of configuration variables and where they are set, use \ncondor_ce_config_val\n. \nPrimarily, This tool is used with the other troubleshooting tools to make sure your configuration is set properly. \nTo see the value of a single variable and where it is set:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val -v \nCONFIGURATION-VARIABLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see a list of all configuration variables and their values:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val -dump\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see a list of all the files that are used to create your configuration and the order that they are parsed, use the\nfollowing command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val -config\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_config_val\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_config_val\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\ncondor_ce_reconfig\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo ensure that your configuration changes have taken effect, run \ncondor_ce_reconfig\n.\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_{on,off,restart}\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo turn on/off/restart HTCondor-CE daemons, use the following commands:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_on\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_off\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_restart\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE service uses the previous commands with default values. \nUsing these commands directly gives you more fine-grained control over the behavior of HTCondor-CE's on/off/restart:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have installed a new version of HTCondor-CE and want to restart the CE under the new version, run the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_restart -fast\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will cause HTCondor-CE to restart and quickly reconnect to all running jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to stop running new jobs, run the following:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_off -peaceful\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will cause HTCondor-CE to accept new jobs without starting them and will wait for currently running jobs to complete before shutting down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE Troubleshooting Data\n\n\nThe following files are located on the CE host.\n\n\nMasterLog\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE master log tracks status of all of the other HTCondor daemons and thus contains valuable information if\nthey fail to start.\n\n\n\n\nLocation: \n/var/log/condor-ce/MasterLog\n\n\nKey

            "text": "Submitting Jobs to an HTCondor-CE\n\n\nThis document outlines methods of manual submission to an HTCondor-CE. It is intended for site administrators wishing to verify the functionality of their HTCondor-CE installation and developers writing software to submit jobs to an HTCondor-CE (e.g., pilot jobs).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nMost incoming jobs are pilots from factories and that manual submission does not reflect the standard method that jobs are submitted to OSG CE\u2019s.\n\n\n\n\nSubmitting Jobs...\n\n\nThere are two main methods for submitting files to an HTCondor-CE: using the tools bundled with the \nhtcondor-ce-client\n package and using the \ncondor_submit\n command with a submit file. Both methods will test end-to-end job submission but the former method is simpler while the latter will walk you through writing your own submit file.\n\n\nBefore attempting to submit jobs, you will need to generate a proxy from a user certificate before running any jobs. To generate a proxy, run the following command on the host you plan on submitting from:\n\n\nuser@host $\n voms-proxy-init\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing HTCondor-CE tools\n\n\nThere are two HTCondor-CE tools that allow users to test the functionality of their HTCondor-CE: \ncondor_ce_trace\n and \ncondor_ce_run\n. The former is the preferred tool as it provides useful feedback if failure occurs while the latter is simply an automated submission tool. These commands may be run from any host that has \nhtcondor-ce-client\n installed, which you may wish to do if you are testing availability of your CE from an external source.\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n is a Python script that uses HTCondor's Python bindings to run diagnostics, including job submission, against your HTCondor-CE. To submit a job with \ncondor_ce_trace\n, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_trace --debug condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE you wish to test. On success, you will see \nJob status: Completed\n and the environment of the job on the worker node it landed on. If you do not get the expected output, refer to the \ntroubleshooting guide\n.\n\n\nRequesting resources\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n doesn't make any specific resource requests so its jobs are only given the default resources by the CE. To request specific resources (or other job attributes), you can specify the \n--attribute\n option on the command line:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_trace --debug --attribute\n=\n+resource1=value1\n...--attribute\n=\n+resourceN=valueN\n condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nTo submit a job that requests 4 cores, 4 GB of RAM, a wall clock time of 2 hours, and the 'osg' queue, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_trace --debug --attribute\n=\n+xcount=4\n --attribute\n=\n+maxMemory=4000\n --attribute\n=\n+maxWallTime=120\n --attribute\n=\n+remote_queue=osg\n condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a list of other attributes that can be set with the \n--attribute\n option, consult the \njob attributes\n section.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNon HTCondor batch systems may need additional configuration to support these job attributes.  See the \njob router recipes\n for details on how to support them.\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_run\n\n\ncondor_ce_run\n is a Python script that calls \ncondor_submit\n on a generated submit file and tracks its progress with \ncondor_q\n. To submit a job with \ncondor_ce_run\n, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_run -r condorce.example.com:9619 /bin/env\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE you wish to test. The command will not return any output until it completes: When it does you will see the environment of the job on the worker noded it landed on. If you do not get the expected output, refer to the \ntroubleshooting guide\n.\n\n\nUsing a submit file...\n\n\nIf you are familiar with HTCondor, submitting a job to an HTCondor-CE using a submit file follows the same procedure as submitting a job to an HTCondor batch system: Write a submit file and use \ncondor_submit\n (or in one of our cases, \ncondor_ce_submit\n) to submit the job. This is by virtue of the fact that HTCondor-CE is just a special configuration of HTCondor. The major differences occur in the specific attributes for the submit files outlined below.\n\n\nFrom the CE host\n\n\nThis method uses \ncondor_ce_submit\n to submit directly to an HTCondor-CE. The only reason we use \ncondor_ce_submit\n in this case is to take advantage of the already running daemons on the CE host.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a submit file, \nce_test.sub\n:\n\n\n# Required for local HTCondor-CE submission\nuniverse = vanilla\nuse_x509userproxy = true\n+Owner = undefined\n\n# Files\nexecutable = \nce_test.sh\n\noutput = ce_test.out\nerror = ce_test.err\nlog = ce_test.log\n\n# File transfer behavior\nShouldTransferFiles = YES\nWhenToTransferOutput = ON_EXIT\n\n# Optional resource requests\n#+xcount = 4            # Request 4 cores\n#+maxMemory = 4000      # Request 4GB of RAM\n#+maxWallTime = 120     # Request 2 hrs of wall clock time\n#+remote_queue = \nosg\n  # Request the OSG queue\n\n# Run job once\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \nce_test.sh\n with the path to the executable you wish to run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use any executable you choose for the \nexecutable\n field. If you don't have one in mind, you may use the following example test script:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\ndate\nhostname\nenv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark the test script as executable:\n\n\nuser@host $\n chmod +x ce_test.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_submit ce_test.sub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom another host\n\n\nFor this method, you will need a functional HTCondor submit node. If you do not have one readily available, you can install the \ncondor\n package from the OSG repository to get a simple submit node:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall HTCondor:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the \ncondor\n service:\n\n\nroot@host $\n service condor start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the \ncondor\n service is running, write a submit file and submit your job:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a submit file, \nce_test.sub\n:\n\n\n# Required for remote HTCondor-CE submission\nuniverse = grid\nuse_x509userproxy = true\ngrid_resource = condor \ncondorce.example.com condorce.example.com\n:9619\n\n# Files\nexecutable = \nce_test.sh\n\noutput = ce_test.out\nerror = ce_test.err\nlog = ce_test.log\n\n# File transfer behavior\nShouldTransferFiles = YES\nWhenToTransferOutput = ON_EXIT\n\n# Optional resource requests\n#+xcount = 4            # Request 4 cores\n#+maxMemory = 4000      # Request 4GB of RAM\n#+maxWallTime = 120     # Request 2 hrs of wall clock time\n#+remote_queue = \nosg\n  # Request the OSG queue\n\n# Run job once\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \ngrid_resource\n line should start with \ncondor\n and is not related to which batch system you are using.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use any executable you choose for the \nexecutable\n field. If you don't have one in mind, you may use the following example test script:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\ndate\nhostname\nenv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark the test script as executable:\n\n\nuser@host $\n chmod +x ce_test.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_submit ce_test.sub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking job progress\n\n\nWhen the job completes, stdout will be placed into \nce_test.out\n, stderr will be placed into \nce_test.err\n, and HTCondor logging information will be placed in \nce_test.log\n. You can track job progress by looking at the condor queue by running the following command on the CE host:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the following table to determine job status:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis value in the \nST\n column...\n\n\nMeans that the job is...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nidle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\ncomplete\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nbeing removed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\nheld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransferring input\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransferring output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Job Routes Affect Your Job\n\n\nUpon successful submission of your job, the Job Router takes control of your job by matching it to routes and submitting a transformed job to your batch system.\n\n\nMatching\n\n\nFirst, the Job Router checks if your job \nmatches any routes\n. It does this by checking the routes \nRequirements\n expression against the job and selecting the first match. If your job does not match any routes, the job will be put on hold and eventually removed from the CE queue without completing.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor versions of HTCondor \n 8.7.1, the JobRouter matches jobs to routes in a round-robin fashion. This means that if a job can match to multiple routes, it can be routed by any of them! So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nThe following three routes only perform filtering and submission of routed jobs to an HTCondor batch system.

Note  For versions of HTCondor   8.7.1, the JobRouter matches jobs to routes in a round-robin fashion. This means that if a job can match to multiple routes, it can be routed by any of them! So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.

Route 3:  Matches jobs whose attribute  foo  is neither equal to  bar  nor  baz .

The only services are \nosg-update-certs\n that keeps the CA certificates up-to-date and \nfetch-crl\n that keeps the CRLs up-to-date. Following the instructions below you'll add the services to your crontab that will take care to run them periodically until you remove them.\n\n\nAuto-updating certificates and CRLs\n\n\nYou must create cron jobs to run \nfetch-crl\n and \nosg-update-certs\n to update your CRLs and certificates automatically.\n\n\nHere is what they should look like.

The squid will need out-bound access to cvmfs stratum 1 servers.\n\n\nHost choice:\n -  Sufficient (~20GB+20%) cache space reserved, preferably in a separate filesystem (details \nbelow\n)\n\n\nFUSE\n: CVMFS requires FUSE\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\n\n\nInstalling CVMFS\n\n\nThe following will install CVMFS from the OSG yum repository. It will also install fuse and autofs if you do not have them, and it will install the configuration for the OSG CVMFS distribution which is called OASIS. To simplify installation, OSG provides convenience RPMs that install all required software with a single command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will update \nall\n packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall CVMFS software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-oasis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomount setup\n\n\nCVMFS uses automount, and the steps to configure it are different on EL6 vs EL7. Follow the section that is appropriate for your host's OS:\n\n\n\n\nFor EL6 hosts\n\n\nFor EL7 hosts\n\n\n\n\nFor EL6 hosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf automount is not yet in use on the system, do the following:\n\n\nroot@host #\n chkconfig autofs on\n\nroot@host #\n service autofs start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate or edit \n/etc/auto.master\n to have the following contents:\n\n\n/cvmfs /etc/auto.cvmfs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart autofs to make the change take effect:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service autofs restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor EL7 hosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf automount is not yet in use on the system, do the following:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl \nenable\n autofs\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start autofs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the following in \n/etc/auto.master.d/cvmfs.autofs\n:\n\n\n/cvmfs /etc/auto.cvmfs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart autofs to make the change take effect:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl restart autofs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring CVMFS\n\n\nCreate or edit \n/etc/cvmfs/default.local\n, a file that controls the\nCVMFS configuration. Below is a sample configuration, but please note\nthat you will need to \nedit the parts in \nred\n. In\nparticular, the \nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY\n line below must be edited for your\nsite.\n\n\nCVMFS_REPOSITORIES=\n`echo $((echo oasis.opensciencegrid.org;echo cms.cern.ch;ls /cvmfs)|sort -u)|tr \n \n ,`\n\nCVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT=\n20000\n\nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=\nhttp://squid.example.com:3128\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCVMFS by default allows any repository to be mounted, no matter what\nthe setting of \nCVMFS_REPOSITORIES\n is; that variable is used by support\ntools such as \ncvmfs_config\n and \ncvmfs_talk\n when they need to know a\nlist of repositories.  The recommended \nCVMFS_REPOSITORIES\n setting\nabove is so that those tools will use two common repositories plus any\nadditional that have been mounted.  You may want to choose a different\nset of always-known repositories.\n\n\nSet up a list of CVMFS HTTP proxies to retrieve from in\n\nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY\n. If you do not have any squid at your site follow\nthe instructions to \ninstall squid from OSG\n.\nVertical bars separating proxies means to load balance between them\nand try them all before continuing. A semicolon between proxies means\nto try that one only after the previous ones have failed. A special\nproxy called DIRECT can be placed last in the list to indicate\ndirectly connecting to servers if all other proxies fail. A DIRECT\nproxy is acceptable for small sites but discouraged for large sites\nbecause of the potential load that could be put upon globally shared\nservers.\n\n\nSet up the cache limit in \nCVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT\n (in MegaBytes). The\nrecommended value for most applications is 20000 MB. This is the\ncombined limit for all but the osgstorage.org repositories.

            "text": "Install Singularity\n\n\nSingularity\n is a tool that creates\ndocker-like process containers but without giving extra privileges to\nunprivileged users.  It is used by grid pilot jobs (which are\nsubmitted by per-VO grid workload management systems) to isolate user\njobs from the pilot's files and processes and from other users' files\nand processes.  It also supplies a chroot environment in order to run\nuser jobs in different operating system images under one Linux kernel.\n\n\nFor operating system kernels older than the one released for\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.4,\nsingularity needs to use kernel capabilities that are only accessible\nto the root user, so it has to be installed with setuid-root\nexecutables.  Securing setuid-root programs is difficult, but singularity\nkeeps that privileged code to a\n\nminimum\n to keep the\nvulnerability low.\n\n\nBeginning with the kernel released with RHEL 7.4, there is a\n\ntechnology preview feature\n\nto allow unprivileged bind mounts in user namespaces, which allows\nsingularity to run as an unprivileged user.  The OSG has installed\nsingularity in \nOASIS\n, so you can avoid installing\nsingularity at all.\n\n\n\n\nKernel vs. Userspace Security\n\n\nEnabling unprivileged user namespaces increases the risk to the\nkernel. However, the kernel is more widely reviewed than Singularity and\nthe additional capability given to users is more limited.\nOSG Security considers the non-setuid, kernel-based method to have a\nlower security risk.\nHowever, Red Hat does not consider technology preview features to be ready for production, so security issues are\nnot guaranteed to be addressed promptly.\n\n\n\n\nThe document is intended for system administrators who wish to either\ninstall singularity or enable it to be run as an unprivileged user.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\nA \nCVMFS installation\n for Singularity image distribution\n\n\n\n\nChoosing Privileged vs Unprivileged Singularity\n\n\nThere are two separate sets of instructions on this page:\n\n\n\n\nInstalling privileged singularity\n via RPM\n\n\nEnabling unprivileged singularity\n via OASIS\n\n\n\n\nAs of May 2018, no VO in the OSG is ready to use unprivileged, non-setuid Singularity out of OASIS in production.\nOnly testing sites will need to follow these instructions; contact the VOs you support for more information.\n\n\nMost sites will want to follow the privileged RPM install instructions until there is wider VO support.\n\n\nPrivileged Singularity\n\n\nThe instructions in this section are for installing singularity with setuid-root executables.\n\n\nInstalling Singularity via RPM\n\n\nTo install singularity as \nsetuid\n, make sure that your host is up to date before installing the required packages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will update \nall\n packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe singularity packages are split into two parts, choose the command that corresponds to your situation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are installing singularity on a worker node, where images do not need to be created or manipulated, install just the smaller part to limit the amount of setuid-root code that is installed:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install singularity-runtime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a full singularity installation, run the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install singularity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIn most cases, only \nsingularity-runtime\n is needed on the worker node;\ninstalling only this smaller package reduces risk of potential security\nexploits.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring singularity\n\n\nThe OSG distribution of singularity includes an option called\n\nunderlay\n that enables using bind mount points that do not exist in\nthe container image.\nIt is not enabled by default but recommended because it is less\nvulnerable to security problems than the similar default \noverlay\n\noption.\nIn addition, the \noverlay\n option does not work on RHEL6 and does not\nwork correctly on RHEL7 when container images are distributed by CVMFS.\n\n\nSet these options in \n/etc/singularity/singularity.conf\n:\n\n\n    use overlay = no\n    use underlay = yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you modify \n/etc/singularity/singularity.conf\n, be careful with\nyour upgrade procedures.\nRPM will not automatically merge your changes with new upstream\nconfiguration keys, which may cause a broken install or inadvertently\nchange the site configuration.  Singularity changes its default\nconfiguration file more frequently than typical OSG software.\n\n\nLook for \nsingularity.conf.rpmnew\n after upgrades and merge in any\nchanges to the defaults.\n\n\n\n\nLimiting image types\n\n\nImages based on loopback devices carry an inherently higher exposure to\nunknown kernel exploits compared to directory-based images distributed via\nCVMFS.  See \nthis article\n for further\ndiscussion.\n\n\nThe loopback-based images are the default image type produced by Singularity\nusers and are common at sites with direct user logins.

It is used by grid pilot jobs (which are\nsubmitted by per-VO grid workload management systems) to isolate user\njobs from the pilot's files and processes and from other users' files\nand processes.  It also supplies a chroot environment in order to run\nuser jobs in different operating system images under one Linux kernel.  For operating system kernels older than the one released for\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.4,\nsingularity needs to use kernel capabilities that are only accessible\nto the root user, so it has to be installed with setuid-root\nexecutables.  Securing setuid-root programs is difficult, but singularity\nkeeps that privileged code to a minimum  to keep the\nvulnerability low.  Beginning with the kernel released with RHEL 7.4, there is a technology preview feature \nto allow unprivileged bind mounts in user namespaces, which allows\nsingularity to run as an unprivileged user.  The OSG has installed\nsingularity in  OASIS , so you can avoid installing\nsingularity at all.   Kernel vs. Userspace Security  Enabling unprivileged user namespaces increases the risk to the\nkernel. However, the kernel is more widely reviewed than Singularity and\nthe additional capability given to users is more limited.\nOSG Security considers the non-setuid, kernel-based method to have a\nlower security risk.\nHowever, Red Hat does not consider technology preview features to be ready for production, so security issues are\nnot guaranteed to be addressed promptly.

To that end, Compute\nElement (CE) installations include Frontier Squid automatically. We\nencourage all sites to configure and use this service, as described\nbelow.\n\n\nFor large sites that expect heavy load on the proxy, it is best to run the proxy on its own host.\nIf you are unsure if your site qualifies, we recommend initially running the proxy on your CE host and monitoring its\nbandwidth.\nIf the network usage regularly peaks at over one third of the bandwidth capacity, move the proxy to a new host.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If it does not exist already, the installation will create the \nsquid\n Linux user\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n Frontier squid communicates on ports 3128 (TCP) and 3401 (UDP)\n\n\nHost choice:\n If you will be supporting the Frontier application at your site, review the\n\nupstream documentation\n to determine how to size your equipment.\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Frontier Squid\n\n\nTo install Frontier Squid, make sure that your host is up to date before installing the required packages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will update \nall\n packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Frontier Squid:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install frontier-squid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Frontier Squid\n\n\nConfiguring the Frontier Squid Service\n\n\nTo configure the Frontier Squid service itself:\n\n\n\n\nFollow the\n    \nConfiguration section of the upstream Frontier Squid documentation\n.\n\n\nEnable, start, and test the service (as described below).\n\n\nRegister the squid\n.\n\n\nIf your site is part of the WLCG, enable WLCG monitoring as described in the\n    \nupstream documentation on enabling monitoring\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAn important difference between the standard Squid software and\nthe Frontier Squid variant is that Frontier Squid changes are in\n\n/etc/squid/customize.sh\n instead of \n/etc/squid/squid.conf\n.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the OSG CE\n\n\nTo configure the OSG Compute Element (CE) to know about your Frontier Squid service:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn your CE host (which may be different than your Frontier Squid host), edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/01-squid.ini\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that \nenabled\n is set to \nTrue\n\n\nSet \nlocation\n to the hostname and port of your Frontier Squid\n    service (e.g., \nmy.squid.host.edu:3128\n)\n\n\nLeave the other settings at \nDEFAULT\n unless you have specific\n    reasons to change them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \nosg-configure -c\n to propagate the changes on your CE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou may want to finish other CE configuration tasks before running\n\nosg-configure\n. Just be sure to run it once before starting CE\nservices.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Frontier-Squid\n\n\nStart the frontier-squid service and enable it to start at boot time. As a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as \nroot\n):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo...\n\n\nOn EL6, run the command...\n\n\nOn EL7, run the command...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a service\n\n\nservice frontier-squid start\n\n\nsystemctl start frontier-squid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop a  service\n\n\nservice frontier-squid stop\n\n\nsystemctl stop frontier-squid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable a service to start on boot\n\n\nchkconfig frontier-squid on\n\n\nsystemctl enable frontier-squid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable a service from starting on boot\n\n\nchkconfig frontier-squid off\n\n\nsystemctl disable frontier-squid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidating Frontier Squid\n\n\nAs any user on another computer, do the following (where\n\nmy.squid.host.edu\n is the fully qualified domain name of your\nsquid server):\n\n\nuser@host $\n \nexport\n \nhttp_proxy\n=\nhttp://\nmy.squid.host.edu\n:3128\n\nuser@host $\n wget -qdO/dev/null http://frontier.cern.ch \n2\n1\n|\ngrep X-Cache\n\nX-Cache: MISS from \nmy.squid.host.edu\n\n\nuser@host $\n wget -qdO/dev/null http://frontier.cern.ch \n2\n1\n|\ngrep X-Cache\n\nX-Cache: HIT from \nmy.squid.host.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the grep doesn't print anything, try removing it from the pipeline\nto see if errors are obvious. If the second try says MISS again,\nsomething is probably wrong with the squid cache writes. Look at the squid\n\naccess.log file\n\nto try to see what's wrong.\n\n\nIf your squid will be supporting the Frontier application, it is also\ngood to do the test in the\n\nupstream documentation Testing the installation section\n.\n\n\nRegistering Frontier Squid\n\n\nSee the \nregistration doc\n for instructions on registering a new resource.\nSee the instructions for \nupdating existing registrations\n\nif you are adding the squid service to an existing resource or resource group.\n\n\nAdditionally:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a \nSquid:\n section to the \nServices:\n list, with any relevant fields for that service.\n    This is a partial example:\n\n\n...\n\n\nFQDN: fully.qualified.DNS.name.of.your.server(s)\n\n\nServices:\n\n\n  Squid:\n\n\n    Description: Generic squid service\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nBNL-ATLAS\n Squid resource for a complete example.\n\n\nIf you have more than one server providing the same squid service,\nit is best to register them with one FQDN that is a round-robin DNS\nentry listing all the squids, instead of registering them separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are setting up a new resource, set \nActive: false\n.\n    Only set \nActive: true\n for a resource when it is accepting requests and ready for production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are running a WLCG site, a few hours after a squid is registered\nand marked Active\n\nverify that it is monitored by WLCG\n.\n\n\nReference\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nThe frontier-squid installation will create one user account unless it\nalready exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsquid\n\n\nReduced privilege user that the squid process runs under.

Applicable versions  This document applies to software from the OSG 3.4 Release Series.\nThe version of frontier-squid installed should be  = 3.5.24-3.1.\nWhen using OSG software from a previous Release Series (eg, OSG 3.3)\nand a frontier-squid version in the 2.7STABLE9 series, refer to the old upstream install documentation \ninstead of the current links included below. There are some\nincompatibilities between the two versions of frontier-squid, so if you\nare upgrading from a 2.7STABLE9 version to a 3.5 version, see the upstream documentation on upgrading .",

Once software is installed into\nan OASIS repository, the goal is to make it available across about 90% of the OSG within an hour.\n\n\nOASIS consists of keysigning infrastructure, a content distribution network (CDN), and a shared CVMFS repository that\nis hosted by the OSG.  Many use cases will be covered by utilizing the \nshared repository\n; this document\ncovers how to install, configure, and host your own CVMFS \nrepository server\n.  This server will distribute software\nvia OASIS, but will be hosted and operated externally from the OSG project.\n\n\nOASIS-based distribution and key signing is available to OSG VOs or repositories affiliated with an OSG VO.\nSee the \npolicy page\n for more information\non what repositories OSG is willing to distribute.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nCVMFS repositories work at the kernel filesystem layer, which adds more stringent host requirements than a typical\nOSG install.  The host OS must meet ONE of the following:\n\n\n\n\nRHEL 7.3 (or equivalent) or later.  \nThis option is recommended\n.\n\n\nRHEL 6 with the aufs kernel module.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally,\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If it does not exist already, the installation will create the \ncvmfs\n Linux user\n\n\nGroup IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux groups \ncvmfs\n and \nfuse\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n This page will configure the repository to distribute using Apache HTTPD on port 8000.  At the\n    minimum, the repository needs in-bound access from the OASIS CDN.\n\n\nDisk space:\n This host will need enough free disk space to host \ntwo\n copies of the software: one compressed\n    and one uncompressed. \n/srv/cvmfs\n will hold all the published data (compressed and de-deuplicated).

Using\n\nxfs\n will work if it was created with \nftype=1\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nRHEL7-based Systems\n\n\nFor a RHEL7-based system, installation is a straightforward install via \nyum\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install cvmfs-server osg-oasis \n\n\n\n\n\nRHEL6-based Systems\n\n\nA RHEL6 host needs additional steps in order to add the AUFS2 kernel module.\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -i https://cvmrepo.web.cern.ch/cvmrepo/yum/cvmfs-release-latest.noarch.rpm\n\nroot@host #\n yum install --enablerepo\n=\ncernvm-kernel --disablerepo\n=\ncernvm kernel aufs2-util cvmfs-server.x86_64 osg-oasis\n\nroot@host #\n reboot\n\n\n\n\n\nApache and Repository Mounts\n\n\nFor all installs, we recommend mounting all the local repositories on startup:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n \ncvmfs_server mount -a\n \n/etc/rc.local\n\nroot@host #\n chmod +x /etc/rc.local\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Apache HTTPD service should be configured to listen on port 8000, have the \nKeepAlive\n option enabled, and be\nstarted:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n Listen \n8000\n \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf \n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n KeepAlive on \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf \n\nroot@host #\n chkconfig httpd on \n\nroot@host #\n service httpd start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Firewalls\n\n\nMake sure that port 8000 is available to the Internet.  Check the setting of the host- and site-level firewalls.\nThe next steps will fail if the web server is not accessible.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Repository\n\n\nPrior to creation, the repository administrator will need to make two decisions:\n\n\n\n\nSelect a repository name\n; typically, this is derived from the VO or project's name and ends in\n    \nopensciencegrid.org\n.  For example, the NoVA VO runs the repository \nnova.opensciencegrid.org\n.  For this section,\n    we will use \nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n.\n\n\nSelect a repository owner\n: Software publication will need to run by a non-\nroot\n Unix user account; for this\n    document, we will use \nLIBRARIAN\n as the account name of the repository owner.\n\n\n\n\nThe initial repository creation must be run as \nroot\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n -e \n\\*\\\\t\\\\t-\\\\tnofile\\\\t\\\\t16384\n \ngt\n;\ngt\n;\n/etc/security/limits.conf\n\nroot@host #\n \nulimit\n -n \n16384\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server mkfs -o \nLIBRARIAN\n \nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\nroot@host #\n cat \ngt\n;\n/srv/cvmfs/\nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n/.htaccess \nlt\n;\nlt\n;\nxEOFx\n\nOrder deny,allow\n\n\nDeny from all\n\n\nAllow from 127.0.0.1\n\n\nAllow from ::1\n\n\nAllow from 129.79.53.0/24 129.93.244.192/26 129.93.227.64/26\n\n\nAllow from 2001:18e8:2:6::/56 2600:900:6::/48 \n\n\nxEOFx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we increase the number of open files allowed, create the repository using the \nmkfs\n command, and then limit the hosts that are allowed to access the repo to the OSG CDN.\n\n\nNext, adjust the configuration in the repository as follows.  \n\n\nroot@host #\n cat \ngt\n;\ngt\n;\n/etc/cvmfs/repositories.d/\nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n/server.conf \nlt\n;\nlt\n;\nxEOFx\n\nCVMFS_AUTO_TAG_TIMESPAN=\n2 weeks ago\n\n\nCVMFS_IGNORE_XDIR_HARDLINKS=true\n\n\nCVMFS_GENERATE_LEGACY_BULK_CHUNKS=false\n\n\nCVMFS_AUTOCATALOGS=true\n\n\nCVMFS_ENFORCE_LIMITS=true\n\n\nCVMFS_FORCE_REMOUNT_WARNING=false\n\n\nxEOFx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, check the \ncvmfs documentation\n for additional recommendations for special purpose repositories.\n\n\nNow verify that the repository is readable over HTTP:\n\n\nroot@host #\n wget -qO- http://localhost:8000/cvmfs/\nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n/.cvmfswhitelist \n|\n cat -v\n\n\n\n\n\nThat should print several lines including some gibberish at the end.\n\n\nHosting a Repository on OASIS\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to host a repository on OASIS, perform the following steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify your VO's OIM registration is up-to-date\n.  All repositories need to be associated with a VO; the VO\n    needs to assign an \nOASIS manager\n in OIM who would be responsible for the contents of any of the VO's repositories\n    and will be contacted in case of issues. To designate an OASIS manager, have the VO manager update the\n    \nOIM registration\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \nsupport ticket\n using the following template:\n\n\nPlease add a new CVMFS repository to OASIS for VO \nvoname\n using the URL \n    http://\nfully.qualified.domain\n:8000/cvmfs/\nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n\nThe VO responsible manager will be \nOASIS Manager Name\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace the \nred\n items with the appropriate values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the repository name matches \n*.opensciencegrid.org\n or \n*.osgstorage.org\n, wait for the go-ahead from the OSG\n    representative before continuing with the remaining instructions; for all other repositories (such as \n*.egi.eu\n),\n    you are done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne you are told in the ticket to proceed to the next step, execute the following commands:\n\n\nroot@host #\n wget -O /srv/cvmfs/\nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n/.cvmfswhitelist \n\\\n\n            http://oasis.opensciencegrid.org/cvmfs/\nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n/.cvmfswhitelist \n\nroot@host #\n /bin/cp /etc/cvmfs/keys/opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid.org.pub \n\\\n\n            /etc/cvmfs/keys/\nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n.pub\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that publishing operation succeeds:\n\n\nroot@host #\n su \nLIBRARIAN\n -c \ncvmfs_server transaction \nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\nroot@host #\n su \nLIBRARIAN\n -c \ncvmfs_server publish \nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin an hour, the repository updates should appear at the GOC and FNAL Stratum-1 servers.\n\n\nOn success, make sure the whitelist update happens daily by creating \n/etc/cron.d/fetch-cvmfs-whitelist\n with the\nfollowing contents:\n\n\n5\n \n4\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \n%\nBLUE\n%\nLIBRARIAN\n%\nENDCOLOR\n%\n \ncd\n \n/\nsrv\n/\ncvmfs\n/%\nRED\n%\nexample\n.\nopensciencegrid\n.\norg\n%\nENDCOLOR\n%\n \namp\n;\namp\n;\n \nwget\n \n-qO\n \n.\ncvmfswhitelist\n.\nnew\n \nhttp\n://\noasis\n.\nopensciencegrid\n.\norg\n/\ncvmfs\n/%\nRED\n%\nexample\n.\nopensciencegrid\n.\norg\n%\nENDCOLOR\n%/\n.\ncvmfswhitelist\n \namp\n;\namp\n;\n \nmv\n \n.\ncvmfswhitelist\n.\nnew\n \n.\ncvmfswhitelist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis cronjob eliminates the need for the repository service administrator to periodically use\n\ncvmfs_server resign\n to update \n.cvmfswhitelist\n as described in the upstream CVMFS documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the open support ticket to indicate that the previous steps have been completed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the repository is fully replicated on the OSG, the VO may proceed in publishing into CVMFS using the\n\nLIBRARIAN\n account on the repository server.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nWe strongly recommend the repository maintainer read through the upstream documentation on\n\nmaintaining repositories\n and\n\ncontent limitations\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf the repository ends in \n.opensciencegrid.org\n, the VO may ask for it to be replicated outside the US.

            "text": "Installing and Maintaining a GridFTP Server\n\n\nAbout This Guide\n\n\nThis page explains how to install the stand-alone Globus GridFTP server.\n\n\nThe GridFTP package contains components necessary to set up a stand-alone gsiftp server and tools used to monitor and report its performance. A stand-alone GridFTP server might be used under the following circumstances:\n\n\n\n\nYou are serving VOs that use storage heavily (CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0) and your site has more than 250 cores\n\n\nYour site will be managing more than 50 TB of disk space\n\n\nA simple front-end to a filesystem allowing access over WAN - for example NFS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis document is for a standalone GridFTP server on top of POSIX storage.  We have two specialized documents\nfor Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and XRootD based storage:\n\n\n\n\nInstall and configure a GridFTP server on top of HDFS.\n\n\nInstall and configure a GridFTP server on top of XRootD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process you will need to fulfill these prerequisites.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\nService certificate: The GridFTP service uses a host certificate at \n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n and an accompanying key at \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\nNetwork ports: GridFTP listens on TCP port 2811 and the list of ports configured by the \nGLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE\n environment variable.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling GridFTP\n\n\nFirst, you will need to install the GridFTP meta-package:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-gridftp\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring GridFTP\n\n\nConfiguring authentication\n\n\nTo configure which virtual organizations and users are allowed to use your GridFTP server, follow the instructions in\n\nthe LCMAPS VOMS plugin document\n.\n\n\nEnabling Gratia GridFTP transfer probe\n\n\nThe \nGratia GridFTP probe\n collects the information about the Gridftp transfers and forwards it to central Gratia collector. You need to enable the probe first. To do this, edit \n/etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig\n to set:\n\n\nEnableProbe=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll other configuration settings should be suitable for most purposes. However, you can edit them if needed. The probe runs every 30 minutes as a cron job.\n\n\nOptional configuration\n\n\nSetting transfer limits for GridFTP-HDFS\n\n\nTo set a limit on the total or per-user number of transfers, create \n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n and set the following configuration:\n\n\nexport GRIDFTP_TRANSFER_LIMIT=\n80\n\nexport GRIDFTP_DEFAULT_USER_TRANSFER_LIMIT=\n50\n\nexport GRIDFTP_\nlt;UNIX USERNAME\ngt;\n_USER_TRANSFER_LIMIT=\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above configuration:\n\n\n\n\nThere would be no more than 80 transfers going at a time, across all users.\n\n\nBy default, any single user can have no more than 50 transfers at a time.\n\n\nThe \nUNIX USERNAME\n user has a more stringent limit of 40 transfers at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis limits are per gridftp server. If you have several gridftp servers you may want to have this limits divided by the number of gridftp servers at your site.\n\n\n\n\nModifying the environment\n\n\nEnvironment variables are stored in \n/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server\n which is sourced on service startup.  If you want to change LCMAPS log levels, or GridFTP port ranges, you can edit them there.\n\n\n#Uncomment and modify for firewalls\n\n\n#export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=min,max\n\n\n#export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=min,max\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the variables \nGLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE\n and \nGLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE\n can be set here to allow GridFTP to navigate around firewall rules (these affect the inbound and outbound ports, respectively).\n\n\nTo troubleshoot LCMAPS authorization, you can add the following to \n/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server\n and choose a higher debug level:\n\n\n# level 0: no messages, 1: errors, 2: also warnings, 3: also notices,\n#  4: also info, 5: maximum debug\nLCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL=2\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput goes to \n/var/log/messages\n by default. Do not set logging to 5 on any production systems as that may cause systems to slow down significantly or become unresponsive.\n\n\nConfiguring a multi-homed server\n\n\nThe GridFTP uses control connections, data connections and IPC connections. By default it listens in all interfaces but this can be changed by editing the configuration file \n/etc/gridftp.conf\n.\n\n\nTo use a single interface you can set \nhostname\n to the Hostname or IP address to use:\n\n\nhostname IP-TO-USE\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also set separately the \ncontrol_interface\n, \ndata_interface\n and \nipc_interface\n.  On systems that have multiple network interfaces, you may want to associate data transfers with the fastest possible NIC available. This can be done in the GridFTP server by setting \ndata_interface\n:\n\n\ncontrol_interface IP-TO-USE\ndata_interface IP-TO-USE\nipc_interface IP-TO-USE\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more options available for the GridFTP server, read the comments in the configuration file (\n/etc/gridftp.conf\n) or see the \nGlobus manual\n.\n\n\nManaging GridFTP\n\n\nIn addition to the GridFTP service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation. The specific services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch CRL\n\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n and \nfetch-crl-cron\n\n\nSee \nCA documentation\n for more info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGratia\n\n\ngratia-probes-cron\n\n\nAccounting software\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nglobus-gridftp-server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidating GridFTP\n\n\nThe GridFTP service can be validated by using globus-url-copy.

            "text": "Load Balancing GridFTP\n\n\nGridFTP is designed for high throughput data transfers and in many cases can handle all of the transfers for a site. However, in some cases it may be useful to run multiple GridFTP servers to distribute the load. For such sites, we recommend using a \nload balancer\n to distribute requests and present the appearance of a single high-throughput GridFTP server.\n\n\nOne general-purpose technology for implementing a load balancer on Linux is \nLinux Virtual Server\n (LVS). To use it with GridFTP, a single load balancer listens on a virtual IP address, monitors the health of the set of real GridFTP servers, and forwards requests to available ones. Optionally, there can be one or more inactive, backup load balancers that can activate and take over the virtual IP address in case the primary load balancer fails, resulting in a system that is more resilient to failure. LVS is implemented by the \nIP Virtual Server\n kernel module, which can be managed by userspace services on the load balancers such as \nkeepalived\n.\n\n\nThis guide explains how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot the \nkeepalived\n service on a load balancing host for a set of \nGridFTP\n servers.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\nThere must be a shared file system for file propagation across GridFTP servers\n\n\nYou must have reserved a virtual IP address and associated virtual hostname\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to each host\n\n\n\n\nDesigning Your Load-Balanced GridFTP System\n\n\nBefore beginning the installation process, you will need to plan the overall architecture of your load-balanced GridFTP system: the number of GridFTP servers, the type of shared file system to run on the GridFTP servers, whether or not backup load balancers are required, and hardware requirements.\n\n\nGridFTP servers\n\n\nThe number of GridFTP servers that you should run is determined first and foremost by the expected GridFTP transfer load at your site and the speed of the links available to each server. For example, if you expect a 20Gbps peak transfer load and have 10Gb links with 80\u201390% efficiency, you would need a minimum of 4 GridFTP servers: 3 to satisfy your desired throughput + 1 for failover or growth.\n\n\nShared file system\n\n\nThe number of GridFTP servers can also be determined by your hardware needs and by your choice of shared file system. If you choose a POSIX-based shared file system, plan for machines with more cores, or more GridFTP hosts to distribute the CPU load. If you are running \nGridFTP with Hadoop\n, plan for machines with more memory, or more GridFTP hosts to distribute the memory load.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you determine that you need only a single GridFTP host, you do not need load balancing. Instead, follow the \nstandalone-GridFTP installation guide\n.\n\n\n\n\nLoad balancer(s)\n\n\nIn the recommended direct routing mode, load balancers simply rewrite initial packets from a given request so the hardware requirements are minimal. When choosing load balancer hosts, aim for stability. If your chosen host is unstable or if you do not want to introduce downtime for operating system or hardware updates, at least one additional load balancer will be needed as a backup.\n\n\nPreparing the GridFTP Servers\n\n\nBefore adding your GridFTP hosts to the load-balanced system, each host requires the following:\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP software\n\n\nSpecial host certificates\n\n\nLoad-balancing configuration\n\n\n\n\nAcquiring host certificate(s)\n\n\nWhen authenticating with a GridFTP server, clients verify that the server's host certificate matches the hostname of the server.

However, in some cases it may be useful to run multiple GridFTP servers to distribute the load. For such sites, we recommend using a  load balancer  to distribute requests and present the appearance of a single high-throughput GridFTP server.  One general-purpose technology for implementing a load balancer on Linux is  Linux Virtual Server  (LVS). To use it with GridFTP, a single load balancer listens on a virtual IP address, monitors the health of the set of real GridFTP servers, and forwards requests to available ones. Optionally, there can be one or more inactive, backup load balancers that can activate and take over the virtual IP address in case the primary load balancer fails, resulting in a system that is more resilient to failure. LVS is implemented by the  IP Virtual Server  kernel module, which can be managed by userspace services on the load balancers such as  keepalived .  This guide explains how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot the  keepalived  service on a load balancing host for a set of  GridFTP  servers.",

For this document,\nwe'll use the words \"Hadoop\" and \"HDFS\" interchangeably, but it's nice to know\nthe distinction.\n\n\nThe HDFS file system has several features, some of which differ a bit from a typical\nfile system:\n\n\n\n\nEach file is broken up into 64 MB or 128 MB chunks (user configurable)\n\n\nThese chunks are stored on data nodes and served up from there; \n\n\nThe central namenode manages block locations, the namespace information, and block placement policies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS provides a subset of POSIX semantics:\n\n\nRandom-access reads and non-random-access writes are fully supported. \n\n\nFsync and appends (after the file has been initially closed) are experimental and not available to OSG-based installs.\n\n\nRewriting closed files is not supported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop SE Components\n\n\nWe broadly break down the server components of the Hadoop SE into three categories: HDFS core, Grid extensions, and HDFS\nauxiliary. \nThe components in each of these categories are outlined below:\n\n\n\n\nHDFS Core:\n\n\nNamenode: The core metadata server of Hadoop. This is the most critical piece of the system, and there can only be one of these. This stores both the file system image and the file system journal. The namenode keeps all of the filesystem layout information (files, blocks, directories, permissions, etc) and the block locations. The filesystem layout is persisted on disk and the block locations are kept solely in memory. When a client opens a file, the namenode tells the client the locations of all the blocks in the file; the client then no longer needs to communicate with the namenode for data transfer.\n\n\nDatanode: This node stores copies of the blocks in HDFS. They communicate with the namenode to perform \"housekeeping\" such as creating new replicas, transferring blocks between datanodes, and deleting excess blocks. They also communicate with the clients to transfer data. To reach the best scalability, there should be as many datanodes as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrid extensions\n\n\nGlobus GridFTP: The standard GridFTP from Globus. We use a plug-in module (using the Globus Direct Storage Interface) that allows the GridFTP process to use the HDFS C-bindings directly.\n\n\nGratia probe: Gratia is an accounting system that records batch system and transfer records to a database. The records are collected by a client program called a \"probe\" which runs on the GridFTP or XRootD server.  The probe parses the GridFTP or XRootD logs and generates transfer records.\n\n\nXRootD server plugin: XRootD is an extremely flexible and powerful data server popular in the high energy physics community. There exists a HDFS plugin for XRootD; integrating with XRootD provides a means to export HDFS securely outside the local cluster, as another XRootD plugin provides GSI-based authentication and authorization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS auxiliary:\n\n\n\"Secondary Namenode\": Perhaps more aptly called a \"checkpoint server\". This server downloads the file system image and journal from the namenode, merges the two together, and uploads the new file system image up to the namenode. This is done on a different server in order to reduce the memory footprint of the namenode.\n\n\nHadoop Balancer: This is a script (unlike the others, which are daemons) that runs on the namenode. It requests transfers of random blocks between the datanodes. This works until all datanodes have approximately the same percentage of free space. Well-balanced datanodes are necessary for having a healthy cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the server components, there are two client components:\n\n\n\n\nFUSE: This allows HDFS to be mounted as a filesystem on the worker nodes. FUSE is a Linux kernel module that allows kernel I/O calls to be translated into a call to a userspace program. In this case, a program called fuse_dfs translates the POSIX calls into HDFS C-binding calls.\n\n\nHadoop Command Line Client: This command line client exposes a lot of the Unix-like calls without mounting FUSE, plus access to the non-POSIX calls (such as setting quotas and file replication levels). For example, \"hadoop fs -ls /\" is equivalent to \"ls /mnt/hadoop\" if /mnt/hadoop is the mount point of HDFS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamenode: We recommend at least 8GB of RAM (minimum is 2GB RAM), preferably 16GB or more. A rough rule of thumb is 1GB per 100TB of raw disk space; the actual requirements is around 1GB per million objects (files, directories, and blocks). The CPU requirements are any modern multi-core server CPU. Typically, the namenode will only use 2-5% of your CPU.\n\n\nAs this is a single point of failure, the \nmost important\n requirement is reliable hardware rather than high performance hardware. We suggest a node with redundant power supplies and at least 2 hard drives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary namenode: This node needs the same amount of RAM as the namenode for merging namespaces. It does not need to be high performance or high reliability.\n\n\nDatanode: Each datanode should plan to dedicate about 1-1.5 GB of RAM to HDFS. A general rule of thumb is to dedicate 1 CPU to HDFS per 5TB of disk capacity under heavily load; clusters with moderate load (i.e., mostly sequential workflows) will need less. At idle, HDFS will consume almost no CPU.\n\n\n\n\nSizing Your Cluster\n\n\nThe minimal installation would involve 5 nodes:\n\n\n\n\nhadoop-name: The namenode for the Hadoop system.  \n\n\nhadoop-name2: This will run the HDFS secondary namenode. \n\n\nhadoop-data1, hadoop-data2: Two HDFS datanodes. They will hold data for the system, so they should have sizable hard drives. As the Hadoop installation grows to many terabytes, this will be the only class of nodes one adds.\n\n\nhadoop-grid: Runs the Globus GridFTP server. \n\n\n\n\nIf desired, hadoop-name and hadoop-name2 may be virtualized. \nPrior to installation, DNS / host name resolution \nmust\n work. \nThat is, you should be able to resolve all the Hadoop servers either through DNS or /etc/hosts. \nBecause of the grid software, hadoop-grid \nmust\n have reverse DNS working.  \n\n\nLarger clusters have the same basic components but with  more HDFS datanodes and gridftp servers. \nAdding HDFS datanodes increases the capacity and  number of IOPS the cluster can provide.\nAdditional GridFTP servers will increase the data transfer rates to locations outside your data center.\nAs your cluster increases in size, virtualized namenodes may need to be moved to physical hardware.\n\n\nHadoop Security\n\n\nHDFS has Unix-like user/group authorization, but no strict authentication. \n\nHDFS should use a secure internal network which only non-malicious users are able to access\n. \nFor users with access to the local cluster, it is not difficult to bypass authentication.\n\n\nThe default ports are listed here\n.\n\n\nThere are some ways to improve security of your cluster:\n\n\n\n\nKeep the namenode behind a firewall. One possibility is to run Hadoop entirely on the private subnet of a cluster.\n\n\nUse firewalls to protect the HDFS ports (default for the datanode is 50010 and 50075; for the namenode, 50070 and 9000).\n\n\nFor clusters utilizing FUSE, one can block outgoing connections to the HDFS ports except for user root. This means that only root-owned processes (such as FUSE-DFS) will be able to access Hadoop.\n\n\nThis is sufficient for grid environments, but does not protect one in the case where the attacker has physical access to the network switch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere exists another option, currently untested. It is possible to limit all HDFS socket connections to SSL-based sockets. Using this to only allow known hosts to connect to HDFS and only allowing FUSE-DFS to connect on those known hosts, one might be able to satisfy even fairly stringent security folks (but not paranoid ones).\n\n\n\n\nThere are three options to export your data outside your cluster:\n\n\n\n\nGlobus GridFTP.\n\n\nXRootD.\n\n\nHTTP and HTTPS.  OSG utilizes the HTTP(S) protocol implementation built into the XRootD server.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nHadoop Architecture",

It is based on the map-reduce framework and design of the Google file system. The OSG distribution of Hadoop includes all components needed to operate a multi-terabyte storage site.\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide Hadoop-based Storage Element administrators the information on how to prepare,\ninstall and validate OSG storage based on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).\nThe OSG supports a patched version HDFS from Cloudera's CDH5 distribution of HDFS\n(\nhttps://www.cloudera.com/products/open-source/apache-hadoop/key-cdh-components.html\n).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe OSG only supports HDFS on EL7 hosts\n\n\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux users \nhdfs\n and \nzookeeper\n on all nodes\n    as well as \nhadoop\n and \nmapred\n on the NameNodes\n\n\nFirewall:\n In the OSG, HDFS is intended to run as an internal service without any direct, external access to any of the nodes.\n    For more information on the ports used for communication between the various HDFS nodes, see the \n    \nCloudera documentation\n.\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\n\n\nDesigning Your HDFS Cluster\n\n\nThere are several important components to an HDFS installation:\n\n\n\n\nNameNode\n: The NameNode functions as the directory server and coordinator of the HDFS cluster.\n    It houses all the meta-data for the hadoop cluster.\n\n\nSecondary NameNode (optional)\n: This is a secondary machine that periodically merges updates to the HDFS file\n    system back into the \nfsimage\n.\n    It must share a directory with the primary NameNode to exchange filesystem checkpoints.\n    An HDFS installation with a Secondary NameNode dramatically improves startup and restart times.\n\n\nDataNode\n: You will have many DataNodes. Each DataNode stores large blocks of files to for the hadoop cluster.\n\n\nClient\n: This is a documentation shorthand that refers to any machine with the hadoop client commands or\n    \nFUSE\n mount.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling HDFS\n\n\nAn OSG HDFS installation consists of HDFS and other support software (e.g., Gratia accounting).\nTo simplify installation, OSG provides convenience RPMs that install all required software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will update \nall\n packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the relevant packages based on the node you are installing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are installing a(n)...\n\n\nThen run the following command...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary NameNode\n\n\nyum install osg-se-hadoop-namenode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary NameNode\n\n\nyum install osg-se-hadoop-secondarynamenode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataNode\n\n\nyum install osg-se-hadoop-datanode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading HDFS\n\n\nThis section will guide you through the process to upgrade a HDFS 2.0.0 installation from OSG 3.3 to the HDFS 2.6.0\nfrom OSG 3.4.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe upgrade process will involve downtime for your HDFS cluster. Please plan accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe OSG only offers HDFS 2.6.0 for EL7 hosts.\n\n\n\n\nThe upgrade process occurs in several steps:\n\n\n\n\nPreparing for the upgrade\n\n\nUpdating to OSG 3.4\n\n\nUpgrading the Primary NameNode\n\n\nUpgrading the DataNodes\n\n\nUpgrading the Secondary NameNode\n\n\nFinalizing the upgrade\n\n\n\n\nPreparing for the upgrade\n\n\nBefore upgrading, backup your configuration data and HDFS metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut your Primary NameNode into safe mode:\n\n\nroot@primary-namenode #\n hdfs dfsadmin -safemode enter\n\nSafe mode is ON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave a clean copy of your HDFS namespace:\n\n\nroot@primary-namenode #\n hdfs dfsadmin -saveNamespace\n\nSave namespace successful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShutdown the HDFS services on all of your HDFS nodes (see \nthis section\n for instructions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the Primary NameNode, verify that your NameNode service is off:\n\n\nroot@primary-namenode #\n /etc/init.d/hadoop-hdfs-namenode status\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command should indicate that your NameNode service is not running.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the location of the directory with the HDFS metadata:\n\n\nroot@primary-namenode #\n grep -C1 dfs.namenode.name.dir /etc/hadoop/conf/hdfs-site.xml\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd look for the value of \ndfs.namenode.name.dir\n:\n\n\nlt;\nproperty\ngt;\n\n \nlt;\nname\ngt;\ndfs.namenode.name.dir\nlt;\n/name\ngt;\n\n  \nlt;\nvalue\ngt;\nfile:///var/lib/dfs/nn,file:///home/hadoop/dfs/nn\nlt;\n/value\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackup the directory that appears in the output using your backup method of choice.\n   If more than one directory appears in the list (as in the example above), choose the most convenient directory.\n   All of the directories in the list will have the same contents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to OSG 3.4\n\n\nOnce your HDFS services have been turned off and the HDFS metadata has been backed up, update each node to OSG 3.4 by\nfollowing the instructions in \nthis section\n.\n\n\nUpgrading the Primary NameNode\n\n\nTo upgrade your Primary NameNode, update all relevant packages then run the upgrade command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear the yum cache:\n\n\nroot@primary-namenode #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the HDFS RPMs:\n\n\nroot@primary-namenode #\n yum update osg-se-hadoop-namenode --enablerepo-osg-upcoming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerform the upgrade command:\n\n\nroot@primary-namenode #\n /etc/init.d/hadoop-hdfs-namenode upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will start the upgrade process for the HDFS metadata on your primary namenode.\nYou can follow the process by running\n\n\nroot@primary-namenode #\n tail -f /var/log/hadoop-hdfs/hadoop-hdfs-namenode-\nlt\n;\nhostname\ngt\n;\n.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading the DataNodes\n\n\nOnce the Primary NameNode has completed its upgrade process, start the process of upgrading each of your DataNodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear the yum cache:\n\n\nroot@datanode #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the HDFS RPMs:\n\n\nroot@datanode #\n yum update osg-se-hadoop-datanode --enablerepo-osg-upcoming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the DataNode service:\n\n\nroot@datanode #\n /etc/init.d/hadoop-hdfs-datanode start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the DataNodes have been brought back up, the Primary NameNode should exit safe mode automatically.\n   On the Primary NameNode, run the following command to verify is no longer in safe mode:\n\n\nroot@primary-namenode #\n hdfs dfsadmin -safemode get\n\nSafe mode is OFF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading the Secondary NameNode\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis section only applies to sites with a Secondary NameNode.\nIf you do not run a Secondary NameNode, skip to the \nnext section\n.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the Primary NameNode has exited safe mode, start the process of upgrading your Secondary NameNode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear the yum cache:\n\n\nroot@secondary-namenode #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the HDFS RPMs:\n\n\nroot@secondary-namenode #\n yum update osg-se-hadoop-secondarynamenode --enablerepo-osg-upcoming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the Secondary NameNode service:\n\n\nroot@secondary-namenode #\n /etc/init.d/hadoop-hdfs-secondarynamenode start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinalizing the upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the HDFS cluster is running correctly by following the instructions in \nthis section\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinalize the upgrade from the Primary NameNode:\n\n\nroot@primary-namenode #\n hdfs dfsadmin -finalizeUpgrade\n\nFinalize upgrade successful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring HDFS\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNeeded by: Hadoop NameNode, Hadoop DataNodes, Hadoop client, GridFTP\n\n\n\n\nHadoop configuration is needed by every node in the hadoop cluster. However, in most cases, you can do the configuration once and copy it to all nodes in the cluster (possibly using your favorite configuration management tool). Special configuration for various special components is given in the below sections.\n\n\nHadoop configuration is stored in \n/etc/hadoop/conf\n. However, by default, these files are mostly blank. OSG provides a sample configuration in \n/etc/hadoop/conf.osg\n with most common values filled in. You will need to copy these into \n/etc/hadoop/conf\n before they become active. Please let us know if there are any common values that should be added/changed across the whole grid. You will likely need to modify \nhdfs-site.xml\n and \ncore-site.xml\n.

(Otherwise, be sure to \nchown\n your storage directory to hdfs after running):\n\n\nhadoop namenode -format\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will initialize the storage directory on your NameNode\n\n\n(optional) FUSE Client Configuration\n\n\nA FUSE mount is required on any node that you would like to use standard POSIX-like commands on the Hadoop filesystem. FUSE (or \"File system in User SpacE\") is a way to access HDFS using typical UNIX directory commands (i.e., POSIX-like access). Note that not all advanced functions of a full POSIX-compliant file system are necessarily available.\n\n\nFUSE is typically installed as part of this installation, but, if you are running a customized or non-standard system, make sure that the fuse kernel module is installed and loaded with \nmodprobe fuse\n.\n\n\nYou can add the FUSE to be mounted at boot time by adding the following line to \n/etc/fstab\n:\n\n\nhadoop-fuse-dfs# \n/mnt/hadoop\n fuse server=\nnamenode.host\n,port=9000,rdbuffer=131072,allow_other 0 0\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to change the \n/mnt/hadoop\n mount point and \nnamenode.host\n to match your local configuration. To match the help documents, we recommend using \n/mnt/hadoop\n as your mountpoint.\n\n\nOnce your \n/etc/fstab\n is updated, to mount FUSE run:\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop\n\nroot@host #\n mount /mnt/hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen mounting the HDFS FUSE mount, you will see the following harmless warnings printed to the screen:\n\n\n#\n mount /mnt/hadoop\n\nINFO fuse_options.c:162 Adding FUSE arg /mnt/hadoop\n\n\nINFO fuse_options.c:110 Ignoring option allow_other\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have troubles mounting FUSE refer to \nRunning FUSE in Debug Mode\n in the Troubleshooting section.\n\n\nCreating VO and User Areas\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nGrid Users are needed by GridFTP nodes. VO areas are common to all nodes.\n\n\n\n\nFor this package to function correctly, you will have to create the users needed for grid operation. Any user that can be authenticated should be created.\n\n\nFor grid-mapfile users, each line of the grid-mapfile is a certificate/user pair. Each user in this file should be created on the server.\n\n\nNote that these users must be kept in sync with the authentication method.\n\n\nPrior to starting basic day-to-day operations, it is important to create dedicated areas for each VO and/or user. This is similar to user management in simple UNIX filesystems. Create (and maintain) usernames and groups with UIDs and GIDs on \nall nodes\n. These are maintained in basic system files such as \n/etc/passwd\n and \n/etc/group\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn the examples below It is assumed a FUSE mount is set to \n/mnt/hadoop\n. As an alternative \nhadoop fs\n commands could have been used.\n\n\n\n\nFor clean HDFS operations and filesystem management:\n\n\n(a) Create top-level VO subdirectories under \n/mnt/hadoop\n.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/cms\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/dzero\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/sbgrid\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/fermigrid\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/cmstest\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/osg\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Create individual top-level user areas, under each VO area, as needed.\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/tanyalevshina\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/michaelthomas\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/brianbockelman\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/douglasstrain\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/abhisheksinghrana\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Adjust username:group ownership of each area.\n\n\nroot@host #\n chown -R cms:cms /mnt/hadoop/cms\n\nroot@host #\n chown -R sam:sam /mnt/hadoop/dzero\n\n\nroot@host #\n chown -R michaelthomas:cms /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/michaelthomas\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP Configuration\n\n\ngridftp-hdfs reads the Hadoop configuration file to learn how to talk to Hadoop.\nBy now, you should have followed the instruction for installing hadoop as detailed in the previous section as well as\ncreated the proper users/directories.\n\n\nThe default settings in \n/etc/gridftp.conf\n along with \n/etc/gridftp.d/gridftp-hdfs.conf\n are used by the init.d script\nand should be ok for most installations.\nThe file \n/etc/gridftp-hdfs/gridftp-debug.conf\n is used by \n/usr/bin/gridftp-hdfs-standalone\n for starting up the\nGridFTP server in a testing mode.\nAny additional config files under \n/etc/gridftp.d\n will be used for both the init.d and standalone GridFTP server.\n\n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n contains additional site-specific environment variables that are used by the gridftp-hdfs\nDSI module in both the init.d and standalone GridFTP server.\nSome of the environment variables that can be used in \n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption Name\n\n\nNeeds Editing?\n\n\nSuggested value\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_HDFS_REPLICA_MAP\n\n\nNo\n\n\nFile containing a list of paths and replica values for setting the default # of replicas for specific file paths\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_BUFFER_COUNT\n\n\nNo\n\n\nThe number of 1MB memory buffers used to reorder data streams before writing them to Hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_FILE_BUFFER_COUNT\n\n\nNo\n\n\nThe number of 1MB file-based buffers used to reorder data streams before writing them to Hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_SYSLOG\n\n\nNo\n\n\nSet this to 1 in case if you want to send transfer activity data to syslog (only used for the HadoopViz application)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_HDFS_MOUNT_POINT\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nThe location of the FUSE mount point used during the Hadoop installation. Defaults to /mnt/hadoop. This is needed so that gridftp-hdfs can convert fuse paths on the incoming URL to native Hadoop paths. \nNote:\n this does not imply you need FUSE mounted on GridFTP nodes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_LOAD_LIMIT\n\n\nNo\n\n\nGridFTP will refuse to start new transfers if the load on the GridFTP host is higher than this number; defaults to 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTMPDIR\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nThe temp directory where the file-based buffers are stored. Defaults to /tmp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n is also a good place to increase per-process resource limits. For example, many installations will require more than the default number of open files (\nulimit -n\n).\n\n\nLastly, you will need to configure an authentication mechanism for GridFTP.\n\n\nConfiguring authentication\n\n\nFor information on how to configure authentication for your GridFTP installation, please refer to the \nconfiguring authentication section of the GridFTP guide\n.\n\n\nGridFTP Gratia Transfer Probe Configuration\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNeeded by GridFTP node only.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gratia probe requires the file \nuser-vo-map\n to exist and be up to date.\nAssuming you installed GridFTP using the \nosg-se-hadoop-gridftp\n rpm, the Gratia Transfer Probe will already be installed.\n\n\nHere are the most relevant file and directory locations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nNeeds Editing?\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbe Configuration\n\n\nYes\n\n\n/etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbe Executables\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/usr/share/gratia/gridftp-transfer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog files\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/var/log/gratia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporary files\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/var/lib/gratia/tmp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGums configuration\n\n\nYes\n\n\n/etc/gums/gums-client.properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RPM installs the Gratia probe into the system crontab, but does not configure it.

Building and installing a \nfuse\n kernel module for your custom kernel is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\nRunning FUSE in Debug Mode\n\n\nTo start the FUSE mount in debug mode, you can run the FUSE mount command by hand:\n\n\nroot@host #\n  /usr/bin/hadoop-fuse-dfs  /mnt/hadoop -o rw,server\n=\nnamenode.host\n,port\n=\n9000\n,rdbuffer\n=\n131072\n,allow_other -d\n\n\n\n\n\nDebug output will be printed to stderr, which you will probably want to redirect to a file. Most FUSE-related problems can be tackled by reading through the stderr and looking for error messages.\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nStarting GridFTP in Standalone Mode\n\n\nIf you would like to test the gridftp-hdfs server in a debug standalone mode, you can run the command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n gridftp-hdfs-standalone\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standalone server runs on port 5002, handles a single GridFTP request, and will log output to stdout/stderr.\n\n\nFile Locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\n\nFile Type\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nNeeds editing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nLog files\n\n\n/var/log/hadoop/*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nPID files\n\n\n/var/run/hadoop/*.pid\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\ninit scripts\n\n\n/etc/init.d/hadoop\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\ninit script config file\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/hadoop\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nruntime config files\n\n\n/etc/hadoop/conf/*\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nSystem binaries\n\n\n/usr/bin/hadoop\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nJARs\n\n\n/usr/lib/hadoop/*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nruntime config files\n\n\n/etc/hosts_exclude\n\n\nYes, must be present on NameNodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nLog files\n\n\n/var/log/gridftp-auth.log\n, \n/var/log/gridftp.log\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\ninit.d script\n\n\n/etc/init.d/globus-gridftp-server\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nruntime config files\n\n\n/etc/gridftp-hdfs/*\n, \n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nSystem binaries\n\n\n/usr/bin/gridftp-hdfs-standalone\n, \n/usr/sbin/globus-gridftp-server\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nSystem libraries\n\n\n/usr/lib64/libglobus_gridftp_server_hdfs.so*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nGUMS client (called by LCMAPS) configuration\n\n\n/etc/lcmaps.db\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nCA certificates\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/certificates/*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService/Process\n\n\nConfiguration File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeStMan2\n\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc\n\n\nMain Configuration file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2\n\n\nEnvironment variables used by BeStMan2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2lib\n\n\nEnvironment variables that store values of various client and server libraries used by BeStMan2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/*\n\n\nOther runtime configuration files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/init.d/bestman2\n\n\ninit.d startup script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/gridftp.conf\n\n\nStartup parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService/Process\n\n\nLog File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeStMan2\n\n\n/var/log/bestman2/bestman2.log\n\n\nBeStMan2 server log and errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/log/bestman2/event.srm.log\n\n\nRecords all SRM transactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\n/var/log/gridftp.log\n\n\nTransfer log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/log/gridftp-auth.log\n\n\nAuthentication log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/log/messages\n\n\nMain system log (look here for LCMAPS errors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nReplicas\n\n\nYou may need to change the following line in \n/usr/share/gridftp-hdfs/gridftp-hdfs-environment\n:\n\n\nexport GRIDFTP_HDFS_REPLICAS=2\n\n\n\n\n\ncopyFromLocal java IOException\n\n\nWhen trying to copy a local file into Hadoop you may come across the following java exception:\n\n\n\n  \nShow detailed java exception\n\n    \n\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:24\u0003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can occur if you try to install a DataNode on a machine with less than 10GB of disk space available.

Review all the settings in these files, but listed below are common settings to modify:             File  Setting  Example  Comments    core-site.xml  fs.default.name  hdfs://namenode.domain.tld.:9000  This is the address of the NameNode    core-site.xml  hadoop.tmp.dir  /data/scratch  Scratch temp directory used by Hadoop    core-site.xml  hadoop.log.dir  /var/log/hadoop-hdfs  Log directory used by Hadoop    core-site.xml  dfs.umaskmode  002  umask for permissions used by default    hdfs-site.xml  dfs.block.size  134217728  Block size: 128MB by default    hdfs-site.xml  dfs.replication  2  Default replication factor. Generally the same as dfs.replication.min/max    hdfs-site.xml  dfs.datanode.du.reserved  100000000  How much free space hadoop will reserve for non-Hadoop usage    hdfs-site.xml  dfs.datanode.handler.count  20  Number of server threads for DataNodes. Increase if you have many more client connections    hdfs-site.xml  dfs.namenode.handler.count  40  Number of server threads for NameNodes. Increase if you need more connections    hdfs-site.xml  dfs.http.address  namenode.domain.tld.:50070  Web address for dfs health monitoring page     See  http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/hdfs-default.xml  for more parameters to configure.

FUSE (or \"File system in User SpacE\") is a way to access HDFS using typical UNIX directory commands (i.e., POSIX-like access). Note that not all advanced functions of a full POSIX-compliant file system are necessarily available.  FUSE is typically installed as part of this installation, but, if you are running a customized or non-standard system, make sure that the fuse kernel module is installed and loaded with  modprobe fuse .  You can add the FUSE to be mounted at boot time by adding the following line to  /etc/fstab :  hadoop-fuse-dfs#  /mnt/hadoop  fuse server= namenode.host ,port=9000,rdbuffer=131072,allow_other 0 0  Be sure to change the  /mnt/hadoop  mount point and  namenode.host  to match your local configuration. To match the help documents, we recommend using  /mnt/hadoop  as your mountpoint.  Once your  /etc/fstab  is updated, to mount FUSE run:  root@host #  mkdir /mnt/hadoop root@host #  mount /mnt/hadoop  When mounting the HDFS FUSE mount, you will see the following harmless warnings printed to the screen:  #  mount /mnt/hadoop INFO fuse_options.c:162 Adding FUSE arg /mnt/hadoop  INFO fuse_options.c:110 Ignoring option allow_other   If you have troubles mounting FUSE refer to  Running FUSE in Debug Mode  in the Troubleshooting section.",

For this package to function correctly, you will have to create the users needed for grid operation. Any user that can be authenticated should be created.  For grid-mapfile users, each line of the grid-mapfile is a certificate/user pair. Each user in this file should be created on the server.  Note that these users must be kept in sync with the authentication method.  Prior to starting basic day-to-day operations, it is important to create dedicated areas for each VO and/or user. This is similar to user management in simple UNIX filesystems. Create (and maintain) usernames and groups with UIDs and GIDs on  all nodes . These are maintained in basic system files such as  /etc/passwd  and  /etc/group .   Note  In the examples below It is assumed a FUSE mount is set to  /mnt/hadoop . As an alternative  hadoop fs  commands could have been used.   For clean HDFS operations and filesystem management:  (a) Create top-level VO subdirectories under  /mnt/hadoop .

            "text": "Installing and Maintaining XRootD\n\n\nXRootD\n is a hierarchical storage system that can be used in a variety of ways to access data,\ntypically distributed among actual storage resources. \nOne way to use XRootD is to have it refer to many data resources at a single site, and another way to use it is to refer\nto many storage systems, most likely distributed among sites.  An XRootD system includes a \nredirector\n, which accepts\nrequests for data and finds a storage repository\u00a0\u2014 locally or\notherwise\u00a0\u2014 that can provide the data to the requestor.\n\n\nUse this page to learn how to install, configure, and use an XRootD redirector as part of a Storage Element (SE) or as\npart of a global namespace.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points:\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If it does not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user ID \nxrootd\n\n\nService certificate:\n The XRootD service uses a host certificate at \n/etc/grid-security/host*.pem\n\n\nNetworking:\n The XRootD service uses port 1094 by default\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling an XRootD Server\n\n\nAn installation of the XRootD server consists of the server itself and its dependencies. \nInstall these with Yum:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring an XRootD Server\n\n\nMinimal configuration\n\n\nA new installation of XRootD is already configured to run a standalone server that serves files from \n/tmp\n on the local\nfile system. \nThis configuration is useful to verify basic connectivity between your clients and your server. \nTo do this, start the \nxrootd\n service with standalone config as described in the \nmanaging services\nsection\n.\n\n\nYou should be able now to copy a file such as \n/bin/sh\n using \nxrdcp\n command into \n/tmp\n. \nTo test, do:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install xrootd-client\n\nroot@host #\n xrdcp /bin/sh root://localhost:1094//tmp/first_test\n\n[xrootd] Total 0.76 MB  [====================] 100.00 % [inf MB/s]\n\n\nroot@host #\n ls -l /tmp/first_test\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 xrootd xrootd 801512 Apr 11 10:48 /tmp/first_test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than for testing, a standalone server is useful when you want to serve files off of a single host with lots of\nlarge disks. \nIf your storage capacity is spread out over multiple hosts, you will need to set up an XRootD cluster.\n\n\nAdvanced configuration\n\n\nAn advanced XRootD setup has multiple components; it is important to validate that each additional component that you\nset up is working before moving on to the next component. \nWe have included validation instructions after each component below.\n\n\nCreating an XRootD cluster\n\n\n\n\nIf your storage is spread out over multiple hosts, you will need to set up an XRootD \ncluster\n. \nThe cluster uses one \"redirector\" node as a frontend for user accesses, and multiple data nodes that have the data that\nusers request. \nTwo daemons will run on each node:\n\n\nxrootd\n\nThe eXtended Root Daemon controls file access and storage.\n\n\ncmsd\n\nThe Cluster Management Services Daemon controls communication between nodes.\n\n\nNote that for large virtual organizations, a site-level redirector may actually also communicate upwards to a regional\nor global redirector that handles access to a multi-level hierarchy. \nThis section will only cover handling one level of XRootD hierarchy.\n\n\nIn the instructions below, \nRDRNODE\n will refer to the redirector host and \nDATANODE\n will\nrefer to the data node host. \nThese should be replaced with the fully-qualified domain name of the host in question.\n\n\nModify /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nYou will need to modify the \nxrootd-clustered.cfg\n on the redirector node and each data node. \nThe following example should serve as a base configuration for clustering. Further customizations are detailed below.\n\n\nall.export \n/tmp\n stage\nset xrdr = \nRDRNODE\n\nall.manager $(xrdr):3121\n\nif $(xrdr)\n  # Lines in this block are only executed on the redirector node\n  all.role manager\nelse\n  # Lines in this block are executed on all nodes but the redirector node\n  all.role server\n  cms.space min \n2g 5g\n\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to customize the following lines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Line\n\n\nChanges Needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nall.export \n/tmp\n stage\n\n\nChange \n/tmp\n to the directory to allow XRootD access to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset xrdr=\nRDRNODE\n\n\nChange to the hostname of the redirector\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncms.space min \n2g 5g\n\n\nReserve this amount of free space on the node. For this example, if space falls below 2GB, xrootd will not store further files on this node until space climbs above 5GB. You can use \nk\n, \nm\n, \ng\n, or \nt\n to indicate kilobyte, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information can be found at \nhttp://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/doc\n\n\nVerifying the clustered config\n\n\nStart both \nxrootd\n and \ncmsd\n on all nodes according to the instructions in the \nmanaging services\nsection\n.\n\n\nVerify that you can copy a file such as \n/bin/sh\n to \n/tmp\n on the server data via the redirector:\n\n\nroot@host #\n xrdcp /bin/sh  root://\nRDRNODE\n:1094///tmp/second_test\n\n[xrootd] Total 0.76 MB  [====================] 100.00 % [inf MB/s]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck that the \n/tmp/second_test\n is located on data server \nDATANODE\n.\n\n\n(Optional) Adding Simple Server Inventory to your cluster\n\n\nThe Simple Server Inventory (SSI) provide means to have an inventory for each data server. \nSSI requires:\n\n\n\n\nA second instance of the \nxrootd\n daemon on the redirector\n\n\nA \"composite name space daemon\" (\nXrdCnsd\n) on each data server; this daemon handles the inventory\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, we will set up a two-node XRootD cluster with SSI.\n\n\nHost A is a redirector node that is running the following daemons:\n\n\n\n\nxrootd redirector\n\n\ncmsd\n\n\nxrootd - second instance that required for SSI\n\n\n\n\nHost B is a data server that is running the following daemons:\n\n\n\n\nxrootd data server\n\n\ncmsd\n\n\nXrdCnsd - started automatically by xrootd\n\n\n\n\nWe will need to create a directory on the redirector node for Inventory files.\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /data/inventory\n\nroot@host #\n chown xrootd:xrootd /data/inventory\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the data server (host B) let's use a storage cache that will be at a different location from \n/tmp\n. \n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p  /local/xrootd\n\nroot@host #\n chown xrootd:xrootd /local/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be running two instances of XRootD on \nhostA\n. \nModify \n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n to give the two instances different behavior, as such:\n\n\nall.export /data/xrootdfs\nset xrdr=\nhostA\n\nall.manager $(xrdr):3121\nif $(xrdr) \n named cns\n      all.export /data/inventory\n      xrd.port 1095\nelse if $(xrdr)\n      all.role manager\n      xrd.port 1094\nelse\n      all.role server\n      oss.localroot /local/xrootd\n      ofs.notify closew create mkdir mv rm rmdir trunc | /usr/bin/XrdCnsd -d -D 2 -i 90 -b $(xrdr):1095:/data/inventory\n      #add cms.space if you have less the 11GB\n      # cms.space options http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/doc/dev/cms_config.htm\n      cms.space min 2g 5g\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of \noss.localroot\n will be prepended to any file access.\n\nE.g. accessing \nroot://\nRDRNODE\n:1094//data/xrootdfs/test1\n will actually go to\n\n/local/xrootd/data/xrootdfs/test1\n.\n\n\nStarting a second instance of XRootD on EL 6\n\n\nThe procedure for starting a second instance differs between EL 6 and EL 7. \nThis section is the procedure for EL 6.\n\n\nNow, we have to change \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd\n on the redirector node (\nhostA\n) to run multiple instances\nof XRootD. \nThe second instance of XRootD will be named \"cns\" and will be used for SSI.\n\n\nXROOTD_USER=xrootd \nXROOTD_GROUP=xrootd \nXROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-k 7\n -l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nXROOTD_CNS_OPTIONS=\n-k 7 -l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n \nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-k 7\n -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n \nFRMD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-k 7\n -l /var/log/xrootd/frmd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n \n\nXROOTD_INSTANCES=\ndefault cns\n \nCMSD_INSTANCES=\ndefault\n \nFRMD_INSTANCES=\ndefault\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can start XRootD cluster executing the following commands. \nOn redirector you will see:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service xrootd start \n\nStarting xrootd (xrootd, default): \n[ OK ]\n \n\n\nStarting xrootd (xrootd, cns): \n[ OK ]\n \n\n\nroot@host #\n service cmsd start \n\nStarting xrootd (cmsd, default): \n[ OK ]\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn redirector node you should see two instances of xrootd running:\n\n\nroot@host #\n ps auxww\n|\ngrep xrootd\n\nxrootd 29036 0.0 0.0 44008 3172 ?

To do that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n and add the following lines. You will also need to add the configuration regarding \nlcmaps authorization\n.\n\n\n   if exec xrootd\n    xrd.protocol http:1094 libXrdHttp.so\n    http.cadir /etc/grid-security/certificates\n    http.cert /etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdcert.pem\n    http.key /etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdkey.pem\n    http.secxtractor /usr/lib64/libXrdLcmaps.so\n    http.listingdeny yes\n    http.staticpreload http://static/robots.txt /etc/xrootd/robots.txt\n    http.desthttps yes\n   fi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate robots.txt. Add file \n/etc/xrootd/robots.txt\n with these contents:\n\n\n   User-agent: *\n   Disallow: /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting the configuration\n\n\nFrom the terminal, generate a proxy and attempt to use davix-get to copy from your XRootD host (the XRootD service needs running; see the \nservices section\n).  For example, if your server has a file named \n/store/user/test.root\n:\n\n\n   davix-get https://\nyourHostname\n:1094/store/user/test.root -E /tmp/x509up_u`id -u` --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor clients to successfully read from the regional redirector, HTTPS must be enabled for the data servers and the site-level redirector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you have \nu *\n in your Authfile, recall this provides an authorization to ALL users, including unauthenticated. This includes random web spiders!\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) Enable HTTP based Writes\n\n\nNo changes to the HTTP module is needed to enable HTTP-based writes.  The HTTP protocol uses the same authorization setup as the XRootD protocol.  For example, you may need to provide \na\n (all) style authorizations to allow users authorization to write. See the \nAuthentication File section\n for more details.\n\n\n(Optional) Enabling a FUSE mount\n\n\nXRootD storage can be mounted as a standard POSIX filesystem via FUSE, providing users with a more familiar interface..\n\n\nModify \n/etc/fstab\n by adding the following entries:\n\n\n....\nxrootdfs                \n/mnt/xrootd\n              fuse    rdr=xroot://\nredirector1.domain.com\n:1094/\n/path/\n,uid=xrootd 0 0\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \n/mnt/xrootd\n with the path that you would like to access with. \nThis should also match the GridFTP settings for the \nXROOTD_VMP\n local path. \nCreate \n/mnt/xrootd\n directory. Make sure the xrootd user exists on the system. Once you are finished, you can mount it:\n\n\nmount /mnt/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to run UNIX commands such as \nls /mnt/xrootd\n to see the contents of the XRootD server.\n\n\n(Optional) Authorization\n\n\nThere are several authorization options in XRootD available through the security plugins. \nIn this document, we will cover two options for security:\n\n\n\n\nSimple Unix Security\n: Based on user accounts that the client is\n    logged in as.\n\n\nShared-key based authentication\n.\n\n\nxrootd-lcmaps\n: Using the LCMAPS callout to use X509-based\n    authentication\n\n\n\n\nNote: On the data nodes, the files will actually be owned by unix user \nxrootd\n (or other daemon user), not as the user\nauthenticated to, under most circumstances. \nXRootD will verify the permissions and authorization based on the user that the security plugin authenticates you to\n(for instance, your unix user for option 1 or your gums id for option 2), but, internally, the data node files will be\nowned by the \nxrootd\n user.\n\n\nAuthorization file\n\n\nIn order to add security to your cluster you will need to add \"auth_file\" on the your data server node. \nCreate \n/etc/xrootd/auth_file\n :\n\n\n# This means that all the users have read access to the datasets \nu * \n/data/xrootdfs\n lr\n\n# This means that all the users have full access to their private dirs \nu = \n/data/xrootdfs/\n@=/ a\n\n# This means that this privileged user can do everything \n# You need at least one user like that, in order to create the \n# private dir for each user willing to store his data in the facility \nu xrootd \n/data/xrootdfs\n a \n\n\n\n\n\nHere we assume that your storage path is \n/data/xrootdfs\n (same as in the\nprevious example).\n\n\nChange file ownership (if you have created file as root):\n\n\nroot@host #\n chown xrootd:xrootd /etc/xrootd/auth_file\n\n\n\n\n\nThis file is a flat file of the following form:\n\n\nidtype id path privs\n\n\n\n\n\nSome examples of each option.

Covers the creation of\n    a load-balanced GridFTP service using multiple servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to following this installation guide, verify the host certificates and networking is configured correctly as in\nthe \nbasic GridFTP install\n.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nGridFTP support for XRootD-based storage is provided by the \nosg-gridftp-xrootd\n meta-package:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-gridftp-xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nFor information on how to configure authentication for your GridFTP installation, please refer to the \nconfiguring\nauthentication section of the GridFTP guide\n.\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd-dsi\n to set \nXROOTD_VMP\n to use your XRootD redirector.\n\n\nexport\n \nXROOTD_VMP\n=\nredirector:1094:/local_path=/remote_path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe syntax of \nXROOTD_VMP\n is tricky; make sure to use the following guidance:\n\n\n\n\nRedirector\n: The hostname and domain of the local XRootD redirector server.\n\n\nlocal_path\n: The path exported by the GridFTP server.\n\n\nremote_path\n: The XRootD path that will be mounted at \nlocal_path\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \nxrootd-dsi\n is enabled, GridFTP configuration changes should go into \n/etc/xrootd-dsi/gridftp-xrootd.conf\n, not\n\n/etc/gridftp.conf\n.\n\nSites should review any customizations made in the latter and copy them as necessary.\n\n\nYou can use the FUSE mount in order to test POSIX access to xrootd in the GridFTP server.\nYou should be able to run Unix commands such as \nls /mnt/xrootd\n and see the contents of the XRootD server.\n\n\nFor log / config file locations and system services to run, see the \nbasic GridFTP install\n.\n\n\nUsing XRootD\n\n\nManaging XRootD services\n\n\nStart services on the redirector node before starting any services on the data nodes. \nIf you installed only XRootD itself, you will only need to start the \nxrootd\n service. \nHowever, if you installed cluster management services, you will need to start \ncmsd\n as well.\n\n\nThe instructions for starting and stopping an XRootD service depend on whether the service is installed on an EL 6 or EL\n7 machine, and whether you are using a standalone or clustered configuration.\n\n\nOn EL 6, which config to use is set in the file \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd\n. \nFor example, to have \nxrootd\n use the clustered config, you would have a line such as this:\n\n\nXROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-\nclustered\n.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the standalone config instead, you would use:\n\n\nXROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-\nstandalone\n.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL 7, which config to use is determined by the service name given to \nsystemctl\n. \nFor example, to have \nxrootd\n use the clustered config, you would start up \nxrootd\n with this line:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start xrootd@\nclustered\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the standalone config instead, you would use:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start xrootd@\nstandalone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService\n\n\nEL 6 service name\n\n\nEL 7 service name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRootD (standalone config)\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\nxrootd@standalone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRootD (clustered config)\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\nxrootd@clustered\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMSD (clustered config)\n\n\ncmsd\n\n\ncmsd@clustered\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as \nroot\n):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \u2026\n\n\nOn EL\u00a06, run the command\u2026\n\n\nOn EL\u00a07, run the command\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a service\n\n\nservice SERVICE-NAME start\n\n\nsystemctl start SERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop a service\n\n\nservice SERVICE-NAME stop\n\n\nsystemctl start SERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable a service to start during boot\n\n\nchkconfig SERVICE-NAME on\n\n\nsystemctl enable SERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable a service from starting during boot\n\n\nchkconfig SERVICE-NAME off\n\n\nsystemctl disable SERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nTo get assistance. please use the \nHelp Procedure\n page.\n\n\nReference\n\n\nFile locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService/Process\n\n\nConfiguration File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nMain clustered mode XRootD configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/xrootd/auth_file\n\n\nAuthorized users file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService/Process\n\n\nLog File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\n/var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log\n\n\nXRootD server daemon log\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncmsd\n\n\n/var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log\n\n\nCluster management log\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncns\n\n\n/var/log/xrootd/cns/xrootd.log\n\n\nServer inventory (composite name space) log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrm_xfrd\n, \nfrm_purged\n\n\n/var/log/xrootd/frmd.log\n\n\nFile Residency Manager log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\nXRootD documentation",

OSG users access the data via the  stashcp  client or from CVMFS.  The architecture of StashCache is illustrated below:   Jobs request data from the nearest discovered cache service.  If there is a cache miss, it will query the OSG redirectors for the\nlocation of the data.  The redirectors query the known origin servers, which then report whether they have the data.  Once the redirector\ndetermines the location, it will redirect the cache server to the appropriate origin.  Finally, the cache will download the data from\nthe origin and",

This service allows a site or regional\nnetwork to cache data frequently used on the OSG, reducing data transfer over the wide-area network and\ndecreasing access latency.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe cache service must be registered with the OSG if it is to be used by clients.  You may start the\nregistration procedure prior to finishing the installation by contacting \n\nwith the following details:\n\n\n\n\nResource name and hostname.\n\n\nAdministrative and security contact.\n\n\n\n\nFollow the \nregistration documentation\n for more information.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation prerequisites for the Cache\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following mandatory points:\n\n\n\n\nOperating system:\n Only RHEL 7 and compatible operating systems are supported.\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user IDs \ncondor\n and\n  \nxrootd\n\n\nHost certificate:\n The StashCache server uses a host certificate to advertise to a central collector.\n  The \nhost certificate documentation\n provides more information on setting up host\n  certificates.\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n The cache service requires inbound ports, one for the xrootd protocol, one for\n  HTTP and, if authenticated StashCache is used, one for HTTPS.  The defaults are:\n\n\nTCP port 1094 for xrootd.\n\n\nTCP port 8000 for HTTP.\n\n\nTCP port 8443 for HTTPS (optional).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware requirements:\n We recommend that a StashCache server has at least 10Gbps connectivity, 1TB of\n disk space, and 8GB of RAM.\n\n\n\n\nIf installing the (optional) authenticated StashCache, you also need to do the following:\n\n\n\n\nService certificate:\n copy the host certificate to \n/etc/grid-security/xrd/xrd{cert,key}.pem\n\n\nSet the owner of the directory and contents \n/etc/grid-security/xrd/\n to \nxrootd:xrootd\n:\nroot@host #\n chown -R xrootd:xrootd /etc/grid-security/xrd/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n.  At this time, we\n  only support RHEL7-based cache servers.\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the Cache\n\n\nThe StashCache daemon consists of an XRootD server and an HTCondor-based service for collecting and reporting\nstatistics about the cache. To simplify installation, OSG provides convenience RPMs that install all required\nsoftware with a single command:\n\n\n    :::console\n    root@host # yum install stashcache-cache-server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf installing authenticated StashCache Cache server, you need an additional package:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install stashcache-cache-server-auth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cache server configuration assumes the disk used to cache data is mounted at \n/stash\n and owned by the\n\nxrootd:xrootd\n user and group.\n\n\nConfiguring the Cache\n\n\nThe \nstashcache-cache-server\n provides a default configuration file,\n\n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-cache-server.cfg\n, which must be customized for your cache.\n\n\nThe most common lines to customize are:\n\n\n\n\nall.sitename YOUR_SITE_NAME\n: The registered OSG resource name.  This \nmust\n be changed.\n\n\nset cachedir = /stash\n: The location of the cache directory for this service.  Files downloaded by the\n  cache will be stored here; we recommend it is at least 1TB in size.\n\n\n*.trace\n, \npss.setopt\n: These control the logging verbosity of the cache.  The defaults are relatively high\n  in order to aid in debugging.  These lines can be commented out to reduce logging; however, if issues occur,\n  OSG support may ask you to re-enable them.\n\n\npfc.ram 7g\n: The amount of RAM the caching service should target to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging the Cache Services\n\n\nYou need to enable and start the following systemd units:\n\n \nxrootd@stashcache-cache-server.service\n\n\n \nfetch-crl-boot\n and \nfetch-crl-cron\n\n* \ncondor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable and start \nxrootd@stashcache-cache-server.service\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl \nenable\n --now xrootd@stashcache-cache-server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate CRLs periodically and on boot. The CRLs are used by HTCondor, as well as the authenticated StashCache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl \nenable\n --now fetch-crl-cron fetch-crl-boot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable and start \ncondor\n for StashCache statistics reporting:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl \nenable\n --now condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese services must be managed with \nsystemctl\n.

The LCMAPS VOMS plugin enables LCMAPS to make mapping decisions based on the VOMS attributes of grid certificates, e.g., \n/cms/Role=production/Capability=NULL\n. Starting in OSG 3.4, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin will replace GUMS and edg-mkgridmap as the authentication method at OSG sites.\n\n\nThe OSG provides a default set of mappings from VOMS attributes to Unix accounts. By configuring LCMAPS, you can override these mappings, including changing the Unix account that a VO is mapped to, banning based on VOMS attributes, banning a specific user, or adding a VO, VO group, VO role, and/or user that is not in the OSG's set of mappings.\n\n\nUse this page to learn how to install and configure the LCMAPS VOMS plugin to authenticate users to access your resources on a per-VO basis.\n\n\nInstalling the LCMAPS VOMS Plugin\n\n\nTo install the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, make sure that your host is up to date before installing the required packages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will update \nall\n packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nlcmaps\n, the default mapfile, and the configuration tools:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install lcmaps vo-client-lcmaps-voms osg-configure-misc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the LCMAPS VOMS Plugin\n\n\nThe following section describes the steps required to configure the LCMAPS VOMS plugin for authentication.\nAdditionally, there are \noptional configuration\n instructions if you need to make changes to\nthe default mappings, or migrate from edg-mkgridmap or GUMS.\n\n\nEnabling the LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n\n\nTo configure your host to use LCMAPS VOMS plugin authentication, edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/10-misc.ini\n and set the following options:\n\n\nedit_lcmaps_db\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\nauthorization_method\n \n=\n \nvomsmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the \nglexec_location\n option is present, you must comment it out or set it to \nUNAVAILABLE\n.\nThe LCMAPS VOMS plugin does not work with gLExec.\n\n\nSupporting mapped VOs and users\n\n\nUnix accounts must exist for each VO, VO role, VO group, or user you choose to support in the \nmapfiles\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsult the default VO mappings in \n/usr/share/osg/voms-mapfile-default\n to determine the mapped Unix account names. Each of the mapfiles has the following format:\n\n\nlt;VO, VO role, VO group or user\ngt;\n \nlt;Unix account\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Unix accounts for each VO, VO role, VO group, and user that you wish to support.\n    The full list of VOs is located on \nOIM\n.\n    You are not expected to support all the VOs.\n    If you would like to support opportunistic usage, we recommend creating the following Unix accounts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVO name\n\n\nUnix account(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGLOW\n\n\nglow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG\n\n\nosg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATLAS\n\n\nusatlas1\n, \nusatlas2\n, \nusatlas3\n, \nusatlas4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS\n\n\ncmspilot\n, \nuscmslocal\n, \ncmslocal\n, \ncmsprod\n, \nlcgadmin\n, \ncmsuser\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFermilab\n\n\nfermigli\n, \nfermilab\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCC\n\n\nhcc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGluex\n\n\ngluex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it is also recommended to create the \nmis\n Unix account,\nwhich is used by OSG staff to assist with troubleshooting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-gip.ini\n and specify the supported VOs per \nSubcluster or ResourceEntry section\n:\n\n\nallowed_vos\n=\nVO1,VO2...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying configuration settings\n\n\nMaking changes to the OSG configuration files in the \n/etc/osg/config.d\n directory does not apply those settings to software automatically. For the OSG settings, use the \nosg-configure\n tool to validate (to a limited extent) and apply the settings to the relevant software components. If instead you wish to manage the LCMAPS VOMS plugin configuration yourself, skip to the \nmanual configuration section\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake all changes to \n.ini\n files in the \n/etc/osg/config.d\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis document only describes the critical settings for the LCMAPS VOMS plugin and related software.

The LCMAPS VOMS plugin (package \nlcmaps-plugins-voms\n) now provides the same functionality. To migrate from edg-mkgridmap to the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, perform the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure user DN mappings:\n\n\n\n\nRemove \n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n\n\n\n\nCheck if you have a local grid mapfile:\n\n\nroot@host #\n grep gmf_local /etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the above command returns a file that exists and has contents, move it to \n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are converting an HTCondor-CE host, remove the HTCondor-CE \nGRIDMAP\n configuration. Otherwise, skip to the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind where \nGRIDMAP\n is set:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_config_val -v GRIDMAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the above command returns a file, remove the \nGRIDMAP\n configuration from that file.\n   Repeat this until the command returns \nNot defined: GRIDMAP\n.\n\n\n\n\nReconfigure HTCondor-CE:\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf running OSG 3.3, disable edg-mkgridmap:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service edg-mkgridmap stop\n\nroot@host #\n chkconfig edg-mkgridmap off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf running OSG 3.4, remove edg-mkgridmap and related packages:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum erase edg-mkgridmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIn the output from this command, yum should \nnot\n list other packages than the one.\nIf it lists other packages, cancel the erase operation, make sure the other packages are updated to their latest OSG 3.4 versions (they should have \".osg34\" in their versions), and try again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigrating from GUMS\n\n\nGUMS is no longer available starting in OSG 3.4 and is being replaced by the LCMAPS VOMS plugin.\nNote that unlike GUMS, which runs on a central host, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin will run on your GUMS clients (e.g. HTCondor-CE, GridFTP, and XRootD).\nTo migrate any custom authentication configuration from GUMS to the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, perform the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn your GUMS host, retrieve the conversion helper script and run it:\n\n\nroot@gums-host #\n wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opensciencegrid/osg-vo-config/mapfile-generator-0.2/bin/manual-mapfile-from-gumsdb.py\n\nroot@gums-host #\n python manual-mapfile-from-gumsdb.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the contents of \nban-mapfile.additions\n, \ngrid-mapfile.additions\n, and \nvoms-mapfile.additions\n include any custom\n   banned users, user mappings, and VO mappings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe above files will not include all VO mappings; the OSG provides default VO mappings in\n\n/usr/share/osg/voms-mapfile-default\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn each of your client hosts (e.g. HTCondor-CE, GridFTP, XRootD), perform the following:\n\n\n\n\nIf you have not done so already, \ninstall\n and \nconfigure\n the LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n\n\nAppend each \n.additions\n file to its corresponding file in \n/etc/grid-security/\n (creating those files if they do not exist)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping VOs\n\n\nTo map VOs, VO roles, or VO groups to Unix accounts based on their VOMS attributes, create \n/etc/grid-security/voms-mapfile\n.\nAn example of the format of a \nvoms-mapfile\n follows:\n\n\n# map GLOW jobs in the chtc group to the \nglow1\n Unix account.\n\n/GLOW/chtc/*\n glow1\n# map GLOW jobs with the htpc role to the \nglow2\n Unix account.\n\n/GLOW/Role=htpc/*\n glow2\n# map other GLOW jobs to the \nglow\n Unix account.\n\n/GLOW/*\n glow\n\n\n\n\n\nEach non-commented line is a shell-style pattern which is compared against the user's VOMS attributes, and a Unix account that the user will be mapped to if the pattern matches.\nThe patterns are compared in the order they are listed in. Therefore, more general patterns should be placed later in the file.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe Unix account must exist for the user to be mapped. If a VO's Unix account is missing, that VO will not be able to access your resources.\n\n\nAdditionally, if you map VOMS attributes to a non-existent user in \n/etc/grid-security/voms-mapfile\n, \n/usr/share/osg/voms-mapfile-default\n will be considered next to find a mapping. The best way to ban a VO is edit \n/etc/grid-security/ban-voms-mapfile\n as described in \nBanning VOs\n below. Do not edit \nvoms-mapfile-default\n as your changes will be overwritten upon updates.\n\n\n\n\nMapping users\n\n\nTo map specific users to Unix accounts based on their certificates' DNs, create \n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n.\nAn example of the format of a \ngrid-mapfile\n follows:\n\n\n# map Matyas\ns FNAL DN to the \nmatyas\n Unix account\n\n/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Matyas Selmeci/CN=UID:matyas\n matyas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe Unix account must exist for the user to be mapped. If a user's Unix account is missing, that user will not be able to access your resources.\n\n\n\n\nBanning VOs\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/ban-voms-mapfile\n is used to ban an entire VO or a role withing a VO from accessing resources on your machine.

grid resources (e.g., HTCondor-CE, XRootD, GridFTP) require host certificates.\nIf you are unsure if your host needs a host certificate, please consult the installation instructions for the software\nyou are interested in installing.\n\n\nTo acquire a host certificate, you must submit a request to a Certificate Authority (CA).\nWe recommend requesting host certificates from one of the following CA services:\n\n\n\n\nInCommon\n: an IGTF-accredited CA for services that interact with the WLCG;\n  requires a subscription, generally held by an institution\n\n\nLet's Encrypt\n: a free, automated, and open CA frequently used for web services;\n  see the \nsecurity team's position on Let's Encrypt\n\n  for more details\n\n\nIf neither of the above options work for your site, the OSG

certificate, use \nopenssl\n to check if your host already has a valid certificate, i.e. the\npresent is between \nnotBefore\n and \nnotAfter\n dates and times.\nIf so, you may safely skip this

to InCommon and offer certificate services.\nIf your institution is in the list of \nInCommon subscribers\n,\ncontinue with the instructions below.\nIf your institution is not in the list, Let's Encrypt certificates do not meet your needs, and you do not have access to\nanother IGTF CA subscription, please \ncontact us\n.\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\n\n\nFrom a host that meets the above requirements, follow the instructions below to request a new host certificate:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the \nosg-pki-tools\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-pki-tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and private key using the \nosg-cert-request\n tool:\n\n\nuser@host $\n osg-cert-request --hostname

\nSAN\n.\nFor example, the following generates a CSR for \ntest.opensciencegrid.org\n with \nfoo.opensciencegrid.org\n and\n\nbar.opensciencegrid.org\n as SANs:\n\n\nuser@host $\n osg-cert-request

automated, and open CA frequently used for web services;\nsee the \nsecurity team's position on Let's Encrypt\n\nfor more details.\nLet's Encrypt can be used to obtain host certificates as an alternative to InCommon if your institution does not have\nan InCommon subscription.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the \ncertbot\n package (available from the EPEL 7 repository):\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install certbot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any service running on port 80, you will have to disable it temporarily to obtain certificates, as Let's\n   Encrypt needs to bind on it temporarily in order to verify the host.\n   For instance, if you already have an HTCondor-CE set up with the\n   \nHTCondor-CE View service\n\n   running, stop the HTCondor-CE View service, as it listens on port 80.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command to obtain the host certificate with Let's Encrypt:\n\n\nroot@host #\n certbot certonly --standalone --email \nlt\n;\nADMIN_EMAIL\ngt\n;\n -d \nlt\n;\nHOST\ngt\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up hostcert/hostkey links:\n\n\nroot@host #\n ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/cert.pem /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n\nroot@host #\n ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/privkey.pem /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\nroot@host #\n chmod \n0600\n /etc/letsencrypt/archive/*/privkey*.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenewing Let's Encrypt host certificates\n\n\nBefore the host certificate expires, you can renew it with the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n certbot renew\n\n\n\n\n\nTo automate the renewal process, you need to choose between using a cron job (SL6 and SL7 hosts) and a systemd timer\n(SL7 hosts only).\nThe two sections below outline both methods for automatically renewing your certificate.\n\n\nAutomating renewals using cron\n\n\nTo automate a monthly renewal with a cron job; you can create \n/etc/cron.d/certbot-renew\n with the following\ncontents:\n\n\n* * 1 * * root certbot renew\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomating renewals using systemd timers\n\n\nTo automate a monthly  renewal using systemd, you'll need to create two files.\nThe first is a service file that tells systemd how to invoke certbot.\nThe second is to generate a timer file that tells systemd how often to run the service.\nThe steps to setup the timer are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a service file called \n/etc/systemd/system/certbot.service\n with the following contents\n\n\n[Unit]\n\n\nDescription\n=\nLet\ns Encrypt renewal\n\n\n\n[Service]\n\n\nType\n=\noneshot\n\n\nExecStart\n=\n/usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet --agree-tos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the certbot service is working correctly, you will need to create the timer file.\n   Create the timer file at \n/etc/systemd/system/certbot.timer\n) with the following contents:\n\n\n[Unit]\n\n\nDescription\n=\nTwice daily renewal of Let\ns Encrypt\ns certificates\n\n\n\n[Timer]\n\n\nOnCalendar\n=\n0/12:00:00\n\n\nRandomizedDelaySec\n=\n1h\n\n\nPersistent\n=\ntrue\n\n\n\n[Install]\n\n\nWantedBy\n=\ntimers.target\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the systemd manager configuration:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl daemon-reload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart and enable the certbot service and timer:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start certbot.service\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl \nenable\n certbot.service\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start certbot.timer\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl \nenable\n certbot.timer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can verify that the timer is active by running \nsystemctl list-timers\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nVerify that the service has started correctly by running \nsystemctl status certbot.service\n. The timer may fail \nwithout warnings if the service does not run correctly.\n\n\n\n\nRequesting Service Certificates\n\n\nPreviously, the OSG recommended using separate X.509 certificates, called \"service certificates\", for each grid service\non a host.\nThis practice has become less popular as sites have separated SSL-requiring services to their own hosts.\n\n\nIn the case where your host is only running a single service that requires a service certificate, we recommend using\nyour host certificate as your service certificate.\nEnsure that the ownership of the host certificate and key are appropriate for the service you are running.\n\n\nIf you are running multiple services that require host certificates, we recommend requesting a certificate whose\nCommonName is \nservice\n-hostname\n and has the hostname in the list of subject alternative names.\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nCan I use any host to request a certificate for a different host?\n\n\nYES, you can use any host to create a certificate signing request as long as the hostname for the certificate is a fully\nqualified domain name.\n\n\nHow do I renew a host certificate?\n\n\nFor Let's Encrypt certificates, see \nthis section\n\n\nFor other certificates, there is no separate renewal procedure.\nInstead, request a new certificate using one of the methods above.\n\n\nHow can I check if I have a host certificate installed already?\n\n\nBy default the host certificate key pair will be installed in \n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n and\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n.\nYou can use \nopenssl\n to access basic information about the certificate:\n\n\nroot@host #\n openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -subject -issuer -dates -noout\n\nsubject= /DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=host.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\nissuer= /DC=org/DC=cilogon/C=US/O=CILogon/CN=CILogon OSG CA 1\n\n\nnotBefore=Apr  8 00:00:00 2013 GMT\n\n\nnotAfter=May 17 12:00:00 2014 GMT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I check the expiration time of my installed host certificate?\n\n\nUse the following \nopenssl\n command to find the dates that your host certificate is valid:\n\n\nroot@host #\n openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -dates -noout\n\nnotBefore=Jan  4 21:08:41 2010 GMT\n\n\nnotAfter=Jan  4 21:08:41 2011 GMT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nCILogon documentation for requesting InCommon certificates\n\n\n\n\nUseful OpenSSL commands (from NCSA)\n - e.g. how to convert the format of your certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Let's Encrypt setup guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother \nLet's Encrypt setup reference\n\n    Under Getting your host certificate, we follow the first \"Setting up\" section.",

Enter a password that is at least 12 characters long and then click on the \nGet New Certificate\n button.\n \n\n\nThe web page will generate a \nusercred.p12\n file and prompt you to download it.  The certiticate will be protected\nusing the password you entered in the prior step.\n\n\n\n\nCertificate formats\n\n\nYour user certficate can be stored in a few different formats.\nThe two most common formats used in OSG are the \nPKCS12\n and\n\nPEM\n formats.\nIn the PEM format, your user certificate is stored in two separate files: one for the certificate and another for the\nprivate key.\nThe PKCS12 format stores the certificate and private key in a single file along with an optional certificate chain.\nMost OSG user tools will work with both but will try to use PEM files first.   \n\n\nTo convert a PKCS12 file to  PEM files, do the following.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, extract your user certificate from your PKCS12 file by running the following command.  You'll be prompted for the password you used to create the certificate. The invocation assumes that the PKCS12 file is called \nusercred.p12\n.  After running, the PEM certificate will be written to \nusercert.pem\n. \n\n\nuser@host $\n openssl pkcs12 -in usercred.p12 -out usercert.pem -nodes -clcerts -nokeys\n\nEnter Import Password:\n\n\nMAC verified OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, extract the private key by running the following command. You'll be prompted for two different passwords.  The first prompt will be for the password that you used to create the certficate.  The second prompt will be for the password that will encrypt the PEM certificate that will be created.  As before, the invocation assumes that your PKCS12 certificate is located in \nusercred.p12\n. After running, the PEM certificate with your private key will be written to \nuserkey.pem\n.\n\n\nuser@host $\n openssl pkcs12 -in usercred.p12 -out userkey.pem  -nocerts\n\nEnter Import Password:\n\n\nMAC verified OK\n\n\nEnter PEM pass phrase:\n\n\nVerifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevoking your user certificate\n\n\nIf the security of your certificate or private key has been compromised, you have a responsibility to revoke the certificate.\nIn addition, if your name or email address changes, you must revoke your certificate and get a new one with the correct\ninformation.\n\n\nIf you have a CILogon issued certificate, contact \nca@cilogon.org\n in order revoke your certificate.\nIf you received a certificate from another CA, please contact the CA to intiate a certificate revocation.\n\n\nGetting a Certificate from a Service Provider with cigetcert\n\n\nYou may also get a user certificate from a SAML 2.0 Service Provider such as your home institution or XSEDE.\nThis kind of certificate is short-lived, typically valid only for a week.\nTherefore it is not suitable for using in your browser.\nHowever, it is useful for command-line access to site services such as compute or storage.\n\n\nYou will need to use the \ncigetcert\n tool to get a certificate this way.\nUse yum to install the \ncigetcert\n package from the OSG repositories.\n\n\nThis is a new way of getting a certificate and does not work with all institutions.\nTo get a list of institutions supported by \ncigetcert\n, run:\n\n\nuser@host $\n cigetcert --listinstitutions\n\nClemson University\n\n\nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory\n\n\nLIGO Scientific Collaboration\n\n\nLTER Network\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a certificate, run\n\n\nuser@host $\n cigetcert -i \nINSTITUTION\n\n\nAuthorizing ...... authorized\n\n\nFetching certificate ..... fetched\n\n\nStoring certificate in /tmp/x509up_u46142\n\n\nYour certificate is valid until: Fri Apr 13 17:03:13 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication is controlled by the institution;\ndepending on the institution, you may need a valid Kerberos token, or will be prompted for a password.\n\n\nIf all goes well, you should see output similar to what's above.\nThe certificate is created in \n/tmp/x509up_u\nYOUR UID\n, which is the same place proxies are created by \ngrid-proxy-init\n.\n\n\nYou may specify default arguments in the \nCIGETCERTOPTS\n environment variable.\nThis can save you from having to type in the entire institution name every time you want a cert.\nFor example, to always use FNAL as the institution, put this in your \n.bashrc\n:\n\n\nexport\n \nCIGETCERTOPTS\n=\n-i \nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour VO may also provide specific instructions for how to best use this tool.\nContact your VO support center for details.\n\n\nFinally, \ncigetcert\n has advanced features, such as the ability to load configuration from a server, or store the cert on a MyProxy server.\nSee the \nmanual page for cigetcert\n for more information.\n\n\nUsing cigetcert with XSEDE credentials\n\n\ncigetcert\n also works with XSEDE as the service provider.\nTo use XSEDE credentials, you will first need an account at \nhttps://portal.xsede.org\n.\nIn addition, you \nneed\n to set up two-factor authentication with XSEDE; see their \nMFA documentation\n for details.\nPush notifications using the Duo Mobile app are required.\n\n\nOnce you have set all those up, run \ncigetcert\n as follows:\n\n\nuser@host $\n cigetcert -u \nUSERNAME\n -i XSEDE\n\n\n\n\n\nUSERNAME\n is your username at portal.xsede.org.\nYou will get prompted to \"Enter XSEDE Kerberos Password.\"\nEnter the password for your account at portal.xsede.org.\nYou should then get a 2FA authentication request with Duo Mobile; once you accept this, \ncigetcert\n will issue the certificate.\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nTo get assistance, please use the \nthis page\n.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nUseful Documentation.OpenSSL commands (from NCSA)\n - e.g. how to convert the format of your certificate.\n\n\nManual page for cigetcert",

You will need to use the  cigetcert  tool to get a certificate this way.\nUse yum to install the  cigetcert  package from the OSG repositories.  This is a new way of getting a certificate and does not work with all institutions.\nTo get a list of institutions supported by  cigetcert , run:  user@host $  cigetcert --listinstitutions Clemson University  Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory  LIGO Scientific Collaboration  LTER Network  ...   To get a certificate, run  user@host $  cigetcert -i  INSTITUTION  Authorizing ...... authorized  Fetching certificate ..... fetched  Storing certificate in /tmp/x509up_u46142  Your certificate is valid until: Fri Apr 13 17:03:13 2018   Authentication is controlled by the institution;\ndepending on the institution, you may need a valid Kerberos token, or will be prompted for a password.  If all goes well, you should see output similar to what's above.\nThe certificate is created in  /tmp/x509up_u YOUR UID , which is the same place proxies are created by  grid-proxy-init .  You may specify default arguments in the  CIGETCERTOPTS  environment variable.\nThis can save you from having to type in the entire institution name every time you want a cert.\nFor example, to always use FNAL as the institution, put this in your  .bashrc :  export   CIGETCERTOPTS = -i  Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory   Your VO may also provide specific instructions for how to best use this tool.\nContact your VO support center for details.  Finally,  cigetcert  has advanced features, such as the ability to load configuration from a server, or store the cert on a MyProxy server.\nSee the  manual page for cigetcert  for more information.",

This page serves as a\nreference guide for several of these tools:\n\n\n\n\nosg-pki-tools\n: command line tools for requesting and managing user and host certificates.\n\n\nosg-ca-certs-updater\n: A package for auto-updating CAs on a server host.\n\n\nosg-ca-manage\n: A tool for detailed management of CA directories outside RPMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis is a reference document and not introduction on how to install CA certificates or request\nhost / user certificates.  Most users will want the \nCA overview\n,\n\nhost certificate overview\n, or \nuser certificate overview\n documents.\n\n\n\n\nOSG PKI Command Line Clients\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe OSG PKI Command Line Clients provide a command-line interface for requesting and issuing host certificates from the OSG PKI. They complement the \nOIM Web Interface\n.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nIf you have not already done so, you need to \nconfigure the OSG software repositories\n.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nThe command-line scripts have been packaged as an RPM and are available from the OSG repositories.\n\n\nTo install the RPM, run:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-pki-tools\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nDocumentation for usage of the osg-pki-tools can be found \nhere\n\n\nOSG CA Certificates Updater\n\n\nThis section explains the installation and use of \nosg-ca-certs-updater\n, a package that provides automatic updates of\nCA certificates.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstall instructions\n\n\nRun the following command to install the latest version of the updater.\n\n\nroot@host#\n yum install osg-ca-certs-updater\n\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\n\nStarting and Enabling Services\n\n\nRun the following to enable the updater. This will persist until the machine is rebooted.\n\n\nroot@host#\n service osg-ca-certs-updater-cron start\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following to enable the updater when the machine is rebooted.\n\n\nroot@host#\n chkconfig osg-ca-certs-updater-cron on\n\n\n\n\n\nRun both commands if you wish for the service to activate immediately and remain active throughout reboots.\n\n\nStopping and Disabling Services\n\n\nEnter the following to disable the updater.

This entry is located in the file \n/etc/cron.d/osg-ca-certs-updater\n. Please see the Unix manual page for \ncrontab\n in section 5 for an explanation of the format. The manual page can be accessed by the command \nman 5 crontab\n. The valid command-line arguments can be listed by running \nosg-ca-certs-updater --help\n. Reasonable defaults have been provided, namely:\n\n\n\n\nAttempt an update no more often than every 23 hours. Due to the random wait (see below), having a 24-hour minimum time between updates would cause the update time to slowly slide back every day.\n\n\nRun the script every 6 hours. We run the script more often than we update so that downtime at the wrong moment does not cause the update to be delayed for a full day.\n\n\nDelay for a random amount of time up to 30 minutes before updating, to reduce load spikes on OSG repositories.\n\n\nDo not warn the administrator about update failures that have happened less than 72 hours since the last successful update.\n\n\nLog errors only.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nUseful configuration and log files\n\n\nConfiguration file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-certs-updater\n\n\nCron entry for periodically launching the updater\n\n\n/etc/cron.d/osg-ca-certs-updater\n\n\nCommand-line arguments to the updater can be specified here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-release\n\n\nRepo definition files for production OSG repositories\n\n\n/etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo\n or \n/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-el6.repo\n\n\nMake sure these repositories are enabled and reachable from the host you are trying to update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog files\n\n\nLogging is performed to the console by default. Please see the manual for your \ncron\n daemon to find out how it handles console output.\n\n\nA logfile can be specified via the \n-l\n / \n--logfile\n command-line option.\n\n\nIf logging to syslog via the \n-s\n / \n--log-to-syslog\n option, the updater will write to the \nuser\n section of the syslog. The file \n/etc/syslog.conf\n determines where syslog messages are saved.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSome guides on X.509 certificates:\n\n\n\n\nUseful commands: \nhttp://security.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/grid-howtos/usefulopenssl.html\n\n\nInstall GSI authentication on a server: \nhttp://security.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/wssec/gsihttps/\n\n\nCertificates how-to: \nhttp://www.nordugrid.org/documents/certificate_howto.html\n\n\n\n\nSome examples about verifying the certificates:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://gagravarr.org/writing/openssl-certs/others.shtml\n\n\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/test-ssl-certificates-diagnosis-ssl-certificate/\n\n\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/debugging-ssl-communications-from-unix-shell-prompt.html\n\n\n\n\nManaging CAs\n\n\nThe osg-ca-manage tool provides a unified interface to manage the CA Certificate installations. This page provides the instructions on using this command. It provides status commands that allows you to list the CAs and the validity of the CAs and CRLs included in the installation. The manage commands allow you to fetch CAs and CRLs, change the distribution URL, as well as add and remove CAs from your local installation.\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\nDocumentation for usage of the osg-ca-manage tool can be found \nhere\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThese commands will not work if of the osg-ca-certs (or igtf-ca-certs) RPM packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\nInstall a certificate authority package\n\n\nBefore you proceed to install a Certificate Authority Package you should decide which of the available packages to install.\n\n\n\n\nosg\n, the package recommended to be used by production resources on the OSG. It is based on the CA distribution from the IGTF, but it may differ slightly as decided by the \nSecurity Team\n.\n\n\nigtf\n, the package is a redistribution of the unchanged CA distribution from the IGTF\n\n\nurl\n a package provided at a given URL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf in doubt, please consult the policies of your home institution and get in contact with the \nSecurity Team\n.\n\n\n\n\nNext decide at what location to install the Certificate Authority Package:\n\n\n\n\non the \nroot\n file system in a system directory \n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n\nin a \ncustom\n directory that can also be shared\n\n\n\n\nSetup the CA certificates\n\n\nThe Certificate Authority Package is preferably be used by grid users without root privileges \nor\n if the CA certificates will not be shared by other installations on the same host.\n\n\nroot@host #\n osg-ca-manage setupca --location \nroot\n --url osg\n\nSetting CA Certificates for at \n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n\n\nSetup completed successfully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a successful installation the certificates will be installed in (\n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n in this example).

This is similar to the IGTF set but may have a small number of additions or deletions\n\n\nThe \nIGTF\n CA certificates\n\n\n\n\nSee \nthis page\n for details of the contents of the OSG CA package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you chose...\n\n\nThen run the following command...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG CA certificates\n\n\nyum install osg-ca-certs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIGTF CA certificates\n\n\nyum install igtf-ca-certs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo automatically keep your RPM installation of CAs up to date, we recommend the \nOSG CA certificates updater\n service.\n\n\nOption 2: Install osg-ca-scripts\n\n\nThe \nosg-ca-scripts\n package provides scripts to install and update predefined sets of CAs with the ability to add or remove specific CAs. \n\n\n\n\nThe OSG CA certificates. This is similar to the IGTF set but may have a small number of additions or deletions\n\n\nThe \nIGTF\n CA certificates\n\n\n\n\nSee \nthis page\n for details of the contents of the OSG CA package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the \nosg-ca-scripts\n package:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-ca-scripts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose and install the CA certificate set:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you choose...\n\n\nThen run the following command...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG CA certificates\n\n\nosg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url osg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIGTF CA certificates\n\n\nosg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url igtf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the \nosg-update-certs-cron\n service to enable periodic CA updates.

To install this RPM, run the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install empty-ca-certs \u2013-enablerepo\n=\nosg-empty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you choose this option, you are responsible for installing and maintaining the CA certificates. They must be installed in \n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n, or a symlink must be made from that location to the directory that contains the CA certificates.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling other CAs\n\n\nIn addition to the above CAs, you can install other CAs via RPM. These only work with the RPMs that provide CAs (that is, \nosg-ca-certs\n and the like, but not \nosg-ca-scripts\n.) They are in addition to the above RPMs, so do not only install these extra CAs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet of CAs\n\n\nRPM name\n\n\nInstallation command (as root)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncilogon-openid\n\n\ncilogon-openid-ca-cert\n\n\nyum install cilogon-openid-ca-cert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerifying CA Certificates\n\n\nAfter installing the CA certificates, they can be verified with the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n curl --cacert \nCA FILE\n \n\\\n\n              --capath \nCA DIRECTORY\n \n\\\n\n              -o /dev/null \n\\\n\n              https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org \n\\\n\n              \n \necho\n \nCA certificate installation verified\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nCA FILE\n is the path to a valid X.509 CA certificate and \nCA DIRECTORY\n is the path to the directory\ncontaining the installed CA certificates.\nFor example, the following command can be used to verify a default OSG CA certificate installation:\n\n\nroot@host #\n curl --cacert /etc/grid-security/certificates/cilogon-osg.pem \n\\\n\n              --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ \n\\\n\n              -o /dev/null \n\\\n\n              https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org \n\\\n\n              \n \necho\n \nCA certificate installation verified\n\n\n  %\n Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n\n\n100 22005    0 22005    0     0  86633      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  499k\n\n\nCA certificate installation verified\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not see \nCA certificate installation verified\n this means that your CA certificate installation is broken.\nFirst, ensure that your CA installation is up-to-date and if you continue to see issues please \ncontact us\n.\n\n\nManaging Certificate Revocation Lists\n\n\nIn addition to CA certificates, you must have updated Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). CRLs contain certificate blacklists that OSG software uses to ensure that your hosts are only talking to valid clients or servers. To maintain up to date CAs, you will need to run the \nfetch-crl\n services. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNormally \nfetch-crl\n is installed when you install the rest of the software and you do not need to explicitly install it.\nIf you do wish to install it manually, run the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install fetch-crl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not wish to change the frequency of \nfetch-crl\n updates (default: every 6 hours) or use syslog for \nfetch-crl\n output, \n\nskip to the service management section\n\n\nOptional: configuring \nfetch-crl\n\n\nThe following sub-sections contain optional configuration instructions.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNote that the \nnosymlinks\n option in the configuration files refers to ignoring links within the certificates directory (e.g. two different names for the same file). It is perfectly fine if the path of the CA certificates directory itself (\ninfodir\n) is a link to a directory.\n\n\n\n\nChanging the frequency of \nfetch-crl-cron\n\n\nTo modify the times that \nfetch-crl-cron\n runs, edit \n/etc/cron.d/fetch-crl\n.\n\n\nLogging with syslog\n\n\nfetch-crl\n can produce quite a bit of output when run in verbose mode. To send \nfetch-crl\n output to syslog, use the following instructions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the configuration file to enable syslog:\n\n\nlogmode = syslog\nsyslogfacility = daemon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the file \n/var/log/daemon\n exists, e.g. touching the file\n\n\n\n\nChange \n/etc/logrotate.d\n files to rotate it\n\n\n\n\nManaging \nfetch-crl\n services\n\n\nfetch-crl\n is installed as two different system services. The fetch-crl-boot service runs \nfetch-crl\n and is intended to only be enabled or disabled. The \nfetch-crl-cron\n service runs \nfetch-crl\n every 6 hours (with a random sleep time included).

Normally, all modules are run when calling \nosg-configure\n.\nHowever, it is possible to run specific modules separately.\nTo see a list of modules, including whether they can be run separately, run:\n\n\n[root@server] osg-configure -l\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the module can be run separately, specify it with the \n-m \nMODULE\n option:\n\n\n[root@server] osg-configure -c -m \nMODULE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions may be specified in multiple INI files, which may make it hard to determine which value OSG-Configure uses.\nYou may query the final value of an option via one of these methods:\n\n\n[root@server] osg-configure -o \nOPTION\n\n\n[root@server] osg-configure -o \nSECTION\n.\nOPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogs are written to \n/var/log/osg/osg-configure.log\n.\nIf something goes wrong, specify the \n-d\n flag to add more verbose output to \nosg-configure.log\n.\n\n\nThe rest of this document will detail what to specify in the INI files.\n\n\nConventions\n\n\nIn the tables below:\n\n\n\n\nMandatory options for a section are given in \nbold\n type. Sometime the default value may be OK and no edit required, but the variable has to be in the file.\n\n\nOptions that are not found in the default ini file are in \nitalics\n.\n\n\n\n\nSyntax and layout\n\n\nThe configuration files used by \nosg-configure\n are the one supported by Python's \nSafeConfigParser\n, similar in format to the \nINI configuration file\n used by MS Windows:\n\n\n\n\nConfig files are separated into sections, specified by a section name in square brackets (e.g. \n[Section 1]\n)\n\n\nOptions should be set using \nname = value\n pairs\n\n\nLines that begin with \n;\n or \n#\n are comments\n\n\nLong lines can be split up using continutations: each white space character can be preceded by a newline to fold/continue the field on a new line (same syntax as specified in \nemail RFC 822\n)\n\n\nVariable substitutions are supported -- \nsee below\n\n\n\n\nosg-configure\n reads and uses all of the files in \n/etc/osg/config.d\n that have a \".ini\" suffix. The files in this directory are ordered with a numeric prefix with higher numbers being applied later and thus having higher precedence (e.g. 00-foo.ini has a lower precedence than 99-local-site-settings.ini). Configuration sections and options can be specified multiple times in different files. E.g. a section called \n[PBS]\n can be given in \n20-pbs.ini\n as well as \n99-local-site-settings.ini\n.\n\n\nEach of the files are successively read and merged to create a final configuration that is then used to configure OSG software. Options and settings in files read later override the ones in previous files. This allows admins to create a file with local settings (e.g. \n99-local-site-settings.ini\n) that can be read last and which will be take precedence over the default settings in configuration files installed by various RPMs and which will not be overwritten if RPMs are updated.\n\n\nVariable substitution\n\n\nThe osg-configure parser allows variables to be defined and used in the configuration file:\nany option set in a given section can be used as a variable in that section.  Assuming that you have set an option with the name \nmyoption\n in the section, you can substitute the value of that option elsewhere in the section by referring to it as \n%(myoption)s\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe trailing \ns\n is required. Also, option names cannot have a variable subsitution in them.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Settings\n\n\nIf a setting is set to UNAVAILABLE or DEFAULT or left blank, osg-configure will try to use a sensible default for setting if possible.\n\n\nIgnore setting\n\n\nThe \nenabled\n option, specifying whether a service is enabled or not, is a boolean but also accepts \nIgnore\n as a possible value. Using Ignore, results in the service associated with the section being ignored entirely (and any configuration is skipped). This differs from using \nFalse\n (or the \n%(disabled)s\n variable), because using \nFalse\n results in the service associated with the section being disabled. \nosg-configure\n will not change the configuration of the service if the \nenabled\n is set to \nIgnore\n.\n\n\nThis is useful, if you have a complex configuration for a given that can't be set up using the ini configuration files. You can manually configure that service by hand editing config files, manually start/stop the service and then use the \nIgnore\n setting so that \nosg-configure\n does not alter the service's configuration and status.\n\n\nConfiguration sections\n\n\nThe OSG configuration is divided into sections with each section starting with a section name in square brackets (e.g. \n[Section 1]\n). The configuration is split in multiple files and options form one section can be in more than one files.\n\n\nThe following sections give an overview of the options for each of the sections of the configuration files that \nosg-configure\n uses.\n\n\nBosco\n\n\nThis section is contained in \n/etc/osg/config.d/20-bosco.ini\n which is provided by the \nosg-configure-bosco\n RPM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nValues Accepted\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenabled\n\n\nTrue\n, \nFalse\n, \nIgnore\n\n\nThis indicates whether the Bosco jobmanager is being used or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusers\n\n\nString\n\n\nA comma separated string.

            "text": "GlideinWMS VO Frontend Installation\n\n\nThis document describes how to install the Glidein Workflow Managment System\n(GlideinWMS) VO Frontend for use with the OSG Glidein factory. This software is\nthe minimum requirement for a VO to use GlideinWMS.\n\n\nThis document assumes expertise with HTCondor and familiarity with the GlideinWMS\nsoftware. It \ndoes not\n cover anything but the simplest possible install.\nPlease consult the \nGlideinWMS reference\ndocumentation\n\nfor advanced topics, including non-\nroot\n, non-RPM-based installation.\n\n\nThis document covers three components of the GlideinWMS a VO needs to install:\n\n\n\n\nUser Pool Collectors\n: A set of \ncondor_collector\n processes. Pilots submitted by the factory will join to one of these collectors to form a HTCondor pool.\n\n\nUser Pool Schedd\n: A \ncondor_schedd\n. Users may submit HTCondor vanilla universe jobs to this schedd; it will run jobs in the HTCondor pool formed by the \nUser Pool Collectors\n.\n\n\nGlidein Frontend\n: The frontend will periodically query the \nUser Pool Schedd\n to determine the desired number of running job slots. If necessary, it will request the Factory to launch additional pilots.\n\n\n\n\nThis guide covers installation of all three components on the same host: it is\ndesigned for small to medium VOs (see the Hardware Requirements below). Given a\nsignificant, large host, we have been able to scale the single-host install to\n20,000 running jobs.\n\n\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux users \napache\n (UID 48), \ncondor\n, \nfrontend\n, and \ngratia\n\n\nNetwork:\n The VO frontend must have reliable network connectivity, be on the public internet (no NAT), and preferably with no firewalls. Incoming TCP ports 9618 and 9620 to 9660 must be open. The Web server port, likely port 80, must be open as well.\n\n\nHost choice\n: The GlideinWMS VO Frontend has the following hardware requirements for a production host:\n\n\nCPU\n: Four cores, preferably no more than 2 years old.\n\n\nRAM\n: 3GB plus 2MB per running job. For example, to sustain 2000 running jobs, a host with 5GB is needed.\n\n\nDisk\n: 30GB will be sufficient for all the binaries, config and log files related to GlideinWMS. As this will be an interactive submit host, have enough disk space for your users' jobs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has a \nsupported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nCredentials and Proxies\n\n\nThe VO Frontend will use two credentials in its interactions with the other GlideinWMS services. At this time, these will be proxy files.\n\n\n\n\nthe \nVO Frontend proxy\n (used to authenticate with the other GlideinWMS services).\n\n\none or more GlideinWMS \npilot proxies\n (used/delegated to the Factory services and submitted on the GlideinWMS pilot jobs).\n\n\n\n\nThe \nVO Frontend proxy\n and the \n pilot proxy\n can\nbe the same. By default, the VO Frontend will run as user \nfrontend\n (UID is\nmachine dependent) so these proxies must be owned by the user \nfrontend\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBoth proxies need to be passwordless to allow \nautomatic proxy renewal\n.\n\n\n\n\nVO Frontend proxy\n\n\nThe use of a service certificate is recommended. Then you create a proxy from the certificate as explained in the \n\nproxy configuration section\n.\n\n\nYou must give the Factory operations team the DN of this proxy when you\ninitially setup the Frontend and each time the DN changes\n.\n\n\nPilot proxies\n\n\nThese proxies are used by the Factory to submit the GlideinWMS pilot jobs.\nTherefore, they must be authorized to access to the CEs (Factory entry points)\nwhere jobs are submitted. There is no need to notify the Factory operation about\nthe DN of these proxies (neither at the initial registration nor for subsequent\nchanges). These additional proxies have no special requirements or controls added by the\nFactory but will probably require VO attributes because of the CEs: if you are\nable to use one of these proxies to submit jobs to the corresponding CEs where the Factory runs\nGlideinWMS pilots for you, then the proxies are OK. You can test each of your proxies using\n\nglobusrun\n or HTCondor-G.\n\n\nTo check the important information about a PEM certificate you can use: \nopenssl\nx509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -subject -issuer -dates -noout\n. You\nwill need that to find out information for the configuration files and the\nrequest to the GlideinWMS Factory.\n\n\nOSG Factory access\n\n\nBefore installing the GlideinWMS VO Frontend you need the information about a \nGlidein Factory\n that you can access:\n\n\n\n\n(recommended) OSG is managing a factory at UCSD and one at GOC and you can request access to them\n\n\nYou have another Glidein Factory that you can access\n\n\n\n\nTo request access to the OSG Glidein Factory at UCSD you have to send an email to \n providing:\n\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\nThe VO that is utilizing the VO Frontend\n\n\nThe DN of the proxy you will use to communicate with the Factory (VO Frontend DN, e.g. the host certificate subject if you follow the \nproxy configuration section\n)\n\n\nYou can propose a security name that will have to be confirmed/changed by the Factory managers (see below)\n\n\n\n\nA list of sites where you want to run:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour VO must be supported on those sites\n\n\n\n\nYou can provide a list or piggy back on existing lists, e.g. all the sites supported for the VO. Check with the Factory managers\n\n\nYou can start with one single site\n\n\n\n\nIn the reply from the OSG Factory managers you will receive some information needed for the configuration of your VO Frontend\n\n\n\n\nThe exact spelling and capitalization of your VO name. Sometime is different from what is commonly used, e.g. OSG VO is \"OSGVO\".\n\n\nThe host of the Factory Collector: \ngfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n\nThe DN os the factory, e.g. \n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n\nThe factory identity, e.g.: \ngfactory@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n\nThe identity on the Factory you will be mapped to. Something like: \nusername@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n\nYour security name. A unique name, usually containing your VO name: \nMy_SecName\n\n\nA string to add in the main Factory query_expr in the Frontend configuration, e.g. \nstringListMember(\"\nVO\n\",GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)\n. This is used to select the entries you can use. From there you get the correct name of the VO (above in this list).\n\n\n\n\nInstalling GlideinWMS Frontend\n\n\nInstalling HTCondor\n\n\nIf you don't have HTCondor already installed, you can install the HTCondor RPM\nfrom the OSG repository:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install condor.x86_64\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you already have installed HTCondor using a tarball or a source other than\nthe OSG ROM, you will need to install the empty-condor RPM:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install empty-condor --enablerepo\n=\nosg-empty\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the VO Frontend RPM\n\n\nInstall the RPM and dependencies (be prepared for a lot of dependencies).\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install glideinwms-vofrontend\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will install the current production release verified and tested by OSG with\ndefault HTCondor configuration. This command will install the GlideinWMS\nvofrontend, HTCondor, the OSG client, and all the required dependencies all on one\nnode.\n\n\nIf you wish to install a different version of GlideinWMS, add the \"--enablerepo\"\nargument to the command as follows:\n\n\n\n\nyum install --enablerepo=osg-testing glideinwms-vofrontend\n: The most recent production release, still in testing phase. This will usually match the current tarball version on the GlideinWMS home page. (The osg-release production version may lag behind the tarball release by a few weeks as it is verified and packaged by OSG). Note that this will also take the osg-testing versions of all dependencies as well.\n\n\nyum install --enablerepo=osg-upcoming glideinwms-vofrontend\n: The most recent development series release, i.e. version 3.3 release. This has newer features such as cloud submission support, but is less tested.\n\n\n\n\nNote that these commands will install default HTCondor configurations with all\nGlideinWMS services on one node.\n\n\nInstalling GlideinWMS Frontend on Multiple Nodes (Advanced)\n\n\nFor advanced users expecting heavy usage on their submit node, you may want to\nconsider splitting the user collector, user submit, and vo frontend\nservices. This can be doing using the following three commands (on different\nmachines):\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install glideinwms-vofrontend-standalone\n\nroot@host #\n yum install glideinwms-usercollector\n\nroot@host #\n yum install glideinwms-userschedd\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, you will need to perform the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nOn the vofrontend and userschedd, modify \nCONDOR_HOST\n to point to your usercollector. This is in \n/etc/condor/config.d/00_gwms_general.config\n. You can also override this value by placing it in a new config file. (For instance, \n/etc/condor/config.d/99_local_custom.config\n to avoid rpmsave/rpmnew conflicts on upgrades).\n\n\nIn \n/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile\n, you will need to add the DNs of each machine (userschedd, usercollector, vofrontend). Take great care to escape all special characters. Alternatively, you can use the \nglidecondor_addDN\n to add these values.\n\n\nIn the \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n file, change the schedd locations to match the correct server. Also change the collectors tags at the bottom of the file. More details on frontend.xml are in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring GlideinWMS Frontend\n\n\nAfter installing the RPM, you need to configure the components of the GlideinWMS VO Frontend:\n\n\n\n\nEdit Frontend configuration options\n\n\nEdit HTCondor configuration options\n\n\nCreate a HTCondor grid map file\n\n\nReconfigure and Start the Frontend\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Frontend\n\n\nThe VO Frontend configuration file is \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n. The next steps will describe each line that you will need to edit if you are using the OSG Factory at UCSD. The portions to edit are highlighted in red font. If you are using a different Factory more changes are necessary, please check the VO Frontend configuration reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe VO you are affiliated with. This will identify those CEs that the GlideinWMS pilot will be authorized to run on using the \npilot proxy\n described previously in \nthis section\n. Sometimes the whole \nquery_expr\n is provided to you by the Factory operators (see Factory access above):\n\n\nlt;\nfactory query_expr=\n((stringListMember(\nVO\n, GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)))\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactory collector information. The \nusername\n that you are assigned by the Factory (also called the identity you will be mapped to on the factory, see above) . Note that if you are using a factory different than the production Factory, you will have to change also \nDN\n, \nfactory_identity\n and \nnode\n attributes. (refer to the information provided to you by the Factory operator):\n\n\nlt;\ncollector DN=\n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n           comment=\nDefine factory collector globally for simplicity\n\n           factory_identity=\ngfactory@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n           my_identity=\nusername@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n           node=\ngfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n/\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend security information.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nclassad_proxy\n in the security entry is the location of the VO Frontend proxy described previously \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe \nproxy_DN\n is the DN of the \nclassad_proxy\n above.\n\n\nThe \nsecurity_name\n identifies this VO Frontend to the the Factory, It is provided by the Factory operator.\n\n\nThe \nabsfname\n in the credential entry is the location of the GlideinWMS \npilot\n proxy described in the requirements section \nhere\n. There can be multiple pilot proxies, or even other kind of keys (e.g. if you use cloud resources). \nThe type and trust_domain of the credential must match respectively auth_method and trust_domain used in the entry definition in the Factory. If there is no match, between these two attributes in one of the credentials and the corresponding ones in some entry in one of the Factories, then this Frontend cannot trigger glideins.\n\nBoth the \nclassad_proxy\n and \nabsfname\n files should be owned by \nfrontend\n user.\nlt;\nsecurity classad_proxy=\n/tmp/vo_proxy\n proxy_DN=\nDN of vo_proxy\n\n      proxy_selection_plugin=\nProxyAll\n\n      security_name=\nThe security name, this is used by factory\n\n      sym_key=\naes_256_cbc\ngt;\n\n      \nlt;\ncredentials\ngt;\n\n        \nlt;\ncredential absfname=\n/tmp/pilot_proxy\n security_class=\nfrontend\n\n        trust_domain=\nOSG\n type=\ngrid_proxy\n/\ngt;\n\n      \nlt;\n/credentials\ngt;\n\n\nlt;\n/security\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe schedd information.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nDN\n of the \nVO Frontend Proxy\n described previously \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe \nfullname\n attribute is the fully qualified domain name of the host where you installed the VO Frontend (\nhostname --fqdn\n).\nA secondary schedd is optional. You will need to delete the secondary schedd line if you are not using it. Multiple schedds allow the Frontend to service requests from multiple submit hosts.\nlt;\nschedds\ngt;\n\n  \nlt;\nschedd DN=\nCert DN used by the schedd at fullname:\n\n        fullname=\nHostname of the schedd\n/\ngt;\n\n   \nlt;\nschedd DN=\nCert DN used by the second Schedd at fullname:\n\n         fullname=\nschedd name@Hostname of second schedd\n/\ngt;\n\n\nlt;\n/schedds\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe User Collector information.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nDN\n of the \nVO Frontend Proxy\n described previously \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe \nnode\n attribute is the full hostname of the collectors (\nhostname --fqdn\n) and port\n\n\nThe \nsecondary\n attribute indicates whether the element is for the primary or secondary collectors (True/False).\n The default HTCondor configuration of the VO Frontend starts multiple Collector processes on the host (\n/etc/condor/config.d/11_gwms_secondary_collectors.config\n). The \nDN\n and \nhostname\n on the first line are the hostname and the host certificate of the VO Frontend. The \nDN\n and \nhostname\n on the second line are the same as the ones in the first one. The hostname (e.g. hostname.domain.tld) is filled automatically during the installation. The secondary collector ports can be defined as a range, e.g., 9620-9660).\nlt;\ncollector DN=\nDN of main collector\n\n       node=\nhostname.domain.tld:9618\n secondary=\nFalse\n/\ngt;\n\n\nlt;\ncollector DN=\nDN of secondary collectors (usually same as DN in line above)\n\n       node=\nhostname.domain.tld:9620-9660\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe Frontend configuration includes many knobs, some of which are conflicting with a RPM installation where there is only one version of the Frontend installed and it uses well known paths.     Do not change the following in the Frontend configuration (you must leave the default values coming with the RPM installation):\n\n\n\n\nfrontend_versioning='False' (in the first line of XML, versioning is useful to install multiple tarball versions)\n\n\nfor RPM installs, work base_dir must be /var/lib/gwms-frontend/vofrontend/ (other scripts like /etc/init.d/gwms-frontend count on that value)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a Different Factory\n\n\nThe configuration above points to the OSG production Factory. If you are using a different Factory, then you have to:\n\n\n\n\nreplace \ngfactory@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n and \ngfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n with the correct values for your Factory. And control also that the name used for the Frontend () matches.\n\n\nmake sure that the Factory is advertising the attributes used in the Factory query expression (\nquery_expr\n).\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring HTCondor\n\n\nThe HTCondor configuration for the Frontend is placed in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n.\n\n\n\n\n00_gwms_general.config\n\n\n01_gwms_collectors.config\n\n\n02_gwms_schedds.config\n\n\n03_gwms_local.config\n\n\n11_gwms_secondary_collectors.config\n\n\n90_gwms_dns.config\n\n\n\n\nFor most installations create a new file named \n/etc/condor/config.d/92_local_condor.config\n\n\nUsing other HTCondor RPMs, e.g. UW Madison HTCondor RPM\n\n\nThe above procedure will work if you are using the OSG HTCondor RPMS. You can\nverify that you used the OSG HTCondor RPM by using \nyum list condor\n. The\nversion name should include \"osg\", e.g. \n8.6.4-3.osg.el7\n.\n\n\nIf you are using the UW Madison HTCondor RPMS, be aware of the following changes:\n\n\n\n\nThis HTCondor RPM uses a file \n/etc/condor/condor_config.local\n to add your local machine slot to the user pool.\n\n\nIf you want to disable this behavior (recommended), you should blank out that file or comment out the line in \n/etc/condor/condor_config\n for LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE. (Make sure that LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR is set to \n/etc/condor/config.d\n)\n\n\nNote that the variable LOCAL_DIR is set differently in UW Madison and OSG RPMs. This should not cause any more problems in the GlideinWMS RPMs, but please take note if you use this variable in your job submissions or other customizations.\n\n\n\n\nIn general if you are using a non OSG RPM or if you added custom configuration\nfiles for HTCondor please check the order of the configuration files:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_config_val -config\n\nConfiguration source:\n\n\n    /etc/condor/condor_config\n\n\nLocal configuration sources:\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/00_gwms_general.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/01_gwms_collectors.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/02_gwms_schedds.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/03_gwms_local.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/11_gwms_secondary_collectors.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/90_gwms_dns.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/condor_config.local\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf, like in the example above, the GlideinWMS configuration files are not the\nlast ones in the list please verify that important configuration options have\nnot been overridden by the other configuration files.\n\n\nVerifying your HTCondor configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GlideinWMS configuration files in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n should be the last ones in the list. If not, please verify that important configuration options have not been overridden by the other configuration files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the alll the expected HTCondor daemons are running:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_config_val -verbose DAEMON_LIST DAEMON_LIST: MASTER, COLLECTOR, NEGOTIATOR, SCHEDD, SHARED_PORT, COLLECTOR0\n\nCOLLECTOR1 COLLECTOR2 COLLECTOR3 COLLECTOR4 COLLECTOR5 COLLECTOR6 COLLECTOR7 COLLECTOR8 COLLECTOR9 COLLECTOR10 , COLLECTOR11, COLLECTOR12,\n\n\nCOLLECTOR13, COLLECTOR14, COLLECTOR15, COLLECTOR16, COLLECTOR17, COLLECTOR18, COLLECTOR19, COLLECTOR20, COLLECTOR21, COLLECTOR22, COLLECTOR23,\n\n\nCOLLECTOR24, COLLECTOR25, COLLECTOR26, COLLECTOR27, COLLECTOR28, COLLECTOR29, COLLECTOR30, COLLECTOR31, COLLECTOR32, COLLECTOR33, COLLECTOR34,\n\n\nCOLLECTOR35, COLLECTOR36, COLLECTOR37, COLLECTOR38, COLLECTOR39, COLLECTOR40\n\n\nDefined in \n/etc/condor/config.d/11_gwms_secondary_collectors.config\n, line 193.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't see all the collectors. shared port and the two schedd, then the\nconfiguration must be corrected. There should be \nno\n \nstartd\n daemons\nlisted.\n\n\nCreating a HTCondor grid mapfile.\n\n\nThe HTCondor mapfile (\n/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile\n) is used for\nauthentication between the GlideinWMS pilot running on a remote worker node, and\nthe local collector. HTCondor uses the mapfile to map certificates to pseudo-users\non the local machine. It is important that you map the DN's of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach schedd proxy\n: The \nDN\n of each schedd that the frontend talks to. Specified in the frontend.xml schedd element \nDN\n attribute:\n\n\nlt;\nschedds\ngt;\n\n  \nlt;\nschedd DN=\n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=YOUR_HOST\n fullname=\nYOUR_HOST\n/\ngt;\n\n  \nlt;\nschedd DN=\n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=YOUR_HOST\n fullname=\nschedd_jobs2@YOUR_HOST\n/\ngt;\n\n\nlt;\n/schedds\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend proxy\n: The DN of the proxy that the Frontend uses to communicate with the other GlideinWMS services.

This allows the !GlideinWMS pilot jobs to communicate with the User Collector. Specified in the frontend.xml proxy \nabsfname\n attribute (you need to specify the \nDN\n of each of those proxies:\n\n\nlt;\nsecurity ....\n\nlt;\nproxies\ngt;\n\n   \nlt;\n proxy absfname=\n/tmp/vo_proxy\n ....\n   :\n\nlt;\n/proxies\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an example mapfile, by default found in\n\n/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile\n.

To configure this service, modify\n\n/etc/gwms-frontend/proxies.ini\n using the following instructions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each of your \npilot proxies\n, create a \n[PILOT \nNAME\n]\n section, where \nNAME\n is a descriptive\n   name for the proxy that is unique to your local configuration. In each section, set the \nproxy_cert\n, \nproxy_key\n,\n   \noutput\n, and \nvo\n corresponding to each pilot proxy:\n\n\n[PILOT \nlt;NAME\ngt;\n]\n\n\nproxy_cert\n \n=\n \nlt;PATH TO THE PILOT CERTIFICATE\ngt;\n\n\nproxy_key\n \n=\n \nlt;PATH TO THE PILOT KEY\ngt;\n\n\noutput\n \n=\n \nlt;PATH TO CREATE THE PILOT PROXY\ngt;\n\n\nvo\n \n=\n \nlt;NAME OF VIRTUAL ORGANIZATION\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, in each \n[PILOT \nNAME\n]\n section, you must specify how the proxy's VOMS attributes will be signed by\nsetting \nuse_voms_server\n. Choose one of the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo directly sign the VOMS attributes (recommended), you must have access to the \nvo\n's certificate and key.\n  Specify the paths to the \nvo\n certificate and key, and optionally, the VOMS attribute (e.g. \n/osg/Role=NULL/Capability=NULL\n\n  for the OSG VO):\n\n\nuse_voms_server = \nfalse\n\nvo_cert = \nlt;PATH TO THE PILOT CERTIFICATE\ngt;\n\nvo_key = \nlt;PATH TO THE PILOT KEY\ngt;\n\nfqan = \nlt;VOMS ATTRIBUTE\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you do not have access to the \nvo\n's \nvoms_cert\n and \nvoms_key\n, contact the VO manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo have your proxy's VOMS attributes signed by the \nvo\n's VOMS server, set \nuse_voms_server = true\n\n  and the VOMS attribute (e.g. \n/osg/Role=NULL/Capability=NULL\n for the OSG VO):\n\n\nuse_voms_server = \ntrue\n\nfqan = \nlt;VOMS ATTRIBUTE\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nDue to the \nretirement of VOMS Admin server\n\nin the OSG, \nuse_voms_server = false\n is the preferred method for signing VOMS attributes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptionally, the proxy renewal \nfrequency\n and \nlifetime\n (in hours) can be specified in each \n[PILOT \nNAME\n]\n section:\n\n\n# Default: 1\nfrequency = \nlt;RENEWAL FREQUENCY\ngt;\n\n# Default: 24\nlifetime = \nlt;PROXY LIFETIME\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the location and output of the \nVO Frontend proxy\n under the \n[FRONTEND]\n section and set\n   the \nproxy_cert\n, \nproxy_key\n, and \noutput\n to paths corresponding to your VO Frontend:\n\n\n[FRONTEND]\n\n\nproxy_cert\n \n=\n \nlt;PATH TO THE FRONTEND CERTIFICATE\ngt;\n\n\nproxy_key\n \n=\n \nlt;PATH TO THE FRONTEND KEY\ngt;\n\n\noutput\n \n=\n \nlt;PATH TO CREATE THE FRONTEND PROXY\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\noutput\n must be the same path as the \nclassad_proxy\n specified in \nthis section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(OPTIONAL)\n If you are running the \ngwms-frontend\n service under a non-default user (default: \nfrontend\n),\n   specify the user as the owner of your proxies under the \n[COMMON]\n section:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \n[COMMON]\n section is required but its contents are optional\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Gratia Accounting and a Local Monitoring Page on a Production Server\n\n\nYou must report accounting information if you are running more than a few test jobs on the OSG .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the GlideinWMS Gratia Probe on each of your submit hosts in your GlideinWMS installation:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install gratia-probe-glideinwms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the ProbeConfig located in \n/etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n. First, edit the \nSiteName\n and \nProbeName\n to be a unique identifier for your GlideinWMS Submit host. There can be multiple probes (with different names) per site. If you haven't already, you should register your GlideinWMS submit host in \nOIM\n. Then you can use the name you used to register the resource.\n\n\nProbeName\n=\ncondor:\nlt;hostname\ngt;\n\n\nSiteName\n=\nHCC-GlideinWMW-Frontend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, turn the probe on by setting \nEnableProbe\n:\n\n\nEnableProbe=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReconfigure HTCondor:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Accounting Configuration\n\n\nThe following sections contain additional configuration that may be required depending on the customizations you've made to your GlideinWMS frontend installation.\n\n\nUsers without Certificates\n\n\nIf you have users that submit jobs without a certificate explicitly declared in the submit file, you will need to add \nMapUnknownToGroup\n to the ProbeConfig. In the file \n/etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n, add the value after the \nEnableProbe\n.\n\n\n    ...\n    SuppressGridLocalRecords=\n0\n\n    EnableProbe=\n1\n\n    \nMapUnknownToGroup=\n1\n\n\n    Title3=\nTuning parameter\n\n    ...\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, if you want to record all usage as coming from a single VO, you can configure the probe to override the 'guessed' VO. In the below example, replace the \nEngage\n with a registered VO that you would like to report as. If you don't have a VO that you are affiliated with, you may use Engage.\n\n\n...\n    MapUnknownToGroup=\n1\n\n    \nMapGroupToRole=\n1\n\n    \nVOOverride=\nEngage\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Standard HTCondor Install\n\n\nIf HTCondor is installed in a non-standard location (i.e., not RPMs, or relocated RPM outside \n/usr/bin\n), then you need to tell the probe where to find the HTCondor binaries. This can be done with a script with a special attribute in \n/etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n, \nCondorLocation\n. Point it to the location of the HTCondor install, such that \nCondorLocation/bin/condor_version\n exists.\n\n\nNew Data Directory\n\n\nIf your \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n HTCondor configuration variable is different from the default value, you must update the value of \nDataFolder\n in \n/etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n. To check the value of \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_config_val PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent collector and other customizations\n\n\nBy default the probe reports to the OSG GRACC. To change that you must edit the configuration file, \n/etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n, and replace the OSG production host with your desired one:\n\n\n...\n    CollectorHost=\ngratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80\n\n    SSLHost=\ngratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:443\n\n    SSLRegistrationHost=\ngratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Configuration\n\n\nThe following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be required\nfor setting up a small site.

The glideinFrontend crashes after a XML parsing exception visible in the log file (\"Exception occurred: ... 'ExpatError: no element found: line 1, column 0\\n']\").\n\n\nRemove the status file. Then start the frontend. The Frontend will be fixed in future versions to handle this automatically.\n\n\nCertificates not there\n\n\nThe scripts should send an email warning if there are problems and they fail to generate the proxies. Anyway something could go wrong and you want to check manually. If you are using the scripts to generate automatically the proxies but the proxies are not there (in \n/tmp\n or wherever you expect them):\n\n\n\n\nmake sure that the scripts are there and configured with the correct values\n\n\nmake sure that the scripts are executable\n\n\nmake sure that the scripts are in \nfrontend\n 's crontab\n\n\nmake sure that the certificates (or master proxy) used to generate the proxies is not expired\n\n\n\n\nFailed authentication\n\n\nIf you get a failed authentication error (e.g. \"Failed to talk to factory_pool gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu...) then:\n\n\n\n\ncheck that you have the right x509 certificates mentioned in the security section of \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n\n\nthe owner must be \nfrontend\n (user running the frontend)\n\n\nthe permission must be 600\n\n\nthey must be valid for more than one hour (2/300 hours), at least the non VO part\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheck that the clock is synchronized (see HostTimeSetup)\n\n\n\n\nFrontend doesn't trust Factory\n\n\nIf your frontend complains in the debug log:\n\n\ncode 256:[\nError: communication error\\n\n, \nAUTHENTICATE:1003:Failed to authenticate with any method\\n\n, \nAUTHENTICATE:1004:Failed to authenticate using GSI\\n\n, \nGSI:5006:Failed to authenticate because the subject \n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=devg-3.t2.ucsd.edu\n is not currently trusted by you.

This software is\nthe minimum requirement for a VO to use GlideinWMS.  This document assumes expertise with HTCondor and familiarity with the GlideinWMS\nsoftware. It  does not  cover anything but the simplest possible install.\nPlease consult the  GlideinWMS reference\ndocumentation \nfor advanced topics, including non- root , non-RPM-based installation.  This document covers three components of the GlideinWMS a VO needs to install:   User Pool Collectors : A set of  condor_collector  processes. Pilots submitted by the factory will join to one of these collectors to form a HTCondor pool.  User Pool Schedd : A  condor_schedd . Users may submit HTCondor vanilla universe jobs to this schedd; it will run jobs in the HTCondor pool formed by the  User Pool Collectors .  Glidein Frontend : The frontend will periodically query the  User Pool Schedd  to determine the desired number of running job slots. If necessary, it will request the Factory to launch additional pilots.   This guide covers installation of all three components on the same host: it is\ndesigned for small to medium VOs (see the Hardware Requirements below). Given a\nsignificant, large host, we have been able to scale the single-host install to\n20,000 running jobs.",

Incoming TCP ports 9618 and 9620 to 9660 must be open. The Web server port, likely port 80, must be open as well.  Host choice : The GlideinWMS VO Frontend has the following hardware requirements for a production host:  CPU : Four cores, preferably no more than 2 years old.  RAM : 3GB plus 2MB per running job. For example, to sustain 2000 running jobs, a host with 5GB is needed.  Disk : 30GB will be sufficient for all the binaries, config and log files related to GlideinWMS. As this will be an interactive submit host, have enough disk space for your users' jobs.

            "text": "Install a CVMFS Stratum 1\n\n\nThis document describes how to install a CVMFS Stratum 1. There are many different variations on how to do that, but this document focuses on the configuration of the OSG GOC Stratum 1 oasis-replica.opensciencegrid.org. It is applicable to other Stratum 1s as well, very likely with modifications (some of which are suggested in the document below).\n\n\n\n\nApplicable versions\n\n\nThe applicable software versions for this document are cvmfs and cvmfs-server \n= 2.4.2.\n\n\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points:\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs and Group IDs:\n If your machine is also going to be a repository server like the OSG GOC, the installation will create the same user and group IDs as the \ncvmfs client\n.  If you are installing frontier-squid, the installation will also create the same user id as \nfrontier-squid\n.\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n This installation will host the stratum 1 on ports 80 and 8000 and, if squid is installed, it will host the uncached apache on port 8081.\n\n\nHost choice:\n -  Make sure there is adequate disk space for the repositories that will be served, at \n/srv/cvmfs\n. Do not use xfs as the filesystem type on operating systems older than EL7, because it has been demonstrated to perform poorly for CVMFS repositories; instead use ext3 or ext4. About 10GB should be reserved for apache and squid logs under /var/log on a production server, although they normally will not get that large. A Stratum 1 that is also a repository server should have at least 5GB available at \n/var/cache\n.\n\n\nSELinux\n - Ensure SELinux is disabled\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\n\n\nInstalling\n\n\nAll CVMFS Stratum 1s require cvmfs-server software and apache (httpd). It is highly recommended to also install \nfrontier-squid\n and \nfrontier-awstats\n on the same machine to be able to easily join the WLCG \nMRTG\n and \nawstats\n monitoring systems. The recommended configuration for frontier-squid below only caches geo api lookups.  Other than that, it is primarily for monitoring.\n\n\nInstalling cvmfs-server and httpd\n\n\nThe OSG GOC Stratum 1 has to function as a repository server in addition to serving repository replications; most Stratum 1s serve only replications. Instructions are also provided for how to install cvmfs-server on Stratum 1s that do not have to be repository servers.  Choose the appropriate subsection.\n\n\nInstalling a CVMFS stratum 1 that is also a repository server\n\n\nEL6 does not support a CVMFS repository server with the standard kernel, so use EL7.  EL7.2 cannot be reliably used as a repository server, because of bugs in the union filesystem OverlayFS. The bugs are fixed in EL7.3, so use EL7.3 or later.\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum -y install cvmfs-server cvmfs mod_wsgi\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling CVMFS stratum 1 that is not a repository server\n\n\nIf you're not installing for the OSG GOC or otherwise want to support serving repositories on the same machine as a Stratum 1, use this command on either EL6 or EL7:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum -y install cvmfs-server cvmfs-config mod_wsgi\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling frontier-squid and frontier-awstats\n\n\nfrontier-awstats\n is not distributed by OSG so these instructions get it from its original source.  Do these commands to install frontier-squid and frontier-awstats:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -i http://frontier.cern.ch/dist/rpms/RPMS/noarch/frontier-release-1.1-1.noarch.rpm\n\nroot@host #\n yum -y install frontier-awstats\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring\n\n\nConfiguring the system\n\n\nIncrease the default number of open file descriptors:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n -e \n*\\t\\t-\\tnofile\\t\\t16384\n \n/etc/security/limits.conf \n\nroot@host #\n \nulimit\n -n \n16384\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order for this to apply also interactively when logging in over ssh, the option \nUsePAM\n has to be set to \nyes\n in \n/etc/ssh/sshd_config\n.\n\n\nConfiguring cron\n\n\nFirst, create the log directory: \n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /var/log/cvmfs\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the following in \n/etc/cron.d/cvmfs\n:\n\n\n*/5 * * * * root test -d /srv/cvmfs || exit;cvmfs_server snapshot -ai \n6 1 * * * root cvmfs_server gc -af 2\n/dev/null || true\n0 9 * * * root find /srv/cvmfs/*.*/data/txn -name \n*.*\n -mtime +2 2\n/dev/null|xargs rm -f\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, put the following in \n/etc/logrotate.d/cvmfs\n:\n\n\n/var/log/cvmfs/*.log {\n    weekly\n    missingok\n    notifempty\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring apache\n\n\nIf you are installing frontier-squid, create \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf\n and put the following lines into it:\n\n\nListen 8081 KeepAlive On\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not installing frontier-squid, instead put the following lines into that file:\n\n\nListen 8000 KeepAlive On\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you will be serving opensciencegrid.org repositories, you have to allow for old client configurations that access repositories without the domain name added.

The repository chosen for the instructions below is one from egi.eu because it is very small, but you can use another one if you prefer.\n\n\nAdding an example repository\n\n\nThe OSG GOC Stratum 1 should add a repository replica using the \nadd_osg_repository\n script from the oasis-goc rpm. Instructions for installing that are elsewhere. That script assumes that the oasis.opensciencegrid.org replica repository was first created, so this instruction creates it but does not download the first snapshot because that would take a lot of space and time. Use these commands to create the oasis replica and to create and download the example replica:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server add-replica -o root http://oasis.opensciencegrid.org:8000/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org /etc/cvmfs/keys/opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid.org.pub \n\nroot@host #\n add_osg_repository http://cvmfs-stratum0.gridpp.rl.ac.uk:8000/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a good idea for other Stratum 1s to make their own scripts for adding repository replicas, because there's always two or three commands to run, and it's easy to forget the commands after the first one. The first command is this:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server add-replica -o root http://cvmfs-stratum0.gridpp.rl.ac.uk:8000/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu /etc/cvmfs/keys/egi.eu/egi.eu.pub\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, non-GOC OSG Stratum 1s (that is, at BNL and FNAL), for the sake of fulfilling an OSG security requirement, need to instead read from the OSG GOC machine with this as their first command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server add-replica -o root http://oasis-replica.opensciencegrid.org:8000/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu /etc/cvmfs/keys/egi.eu/egi.eu.pub:/etc/cvmfs/keys/opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid.org.pub\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second command for Stratum 1s that have the httpd configuration as described above in the \nConfiguring apache section\n is this:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rm -f /etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.config-egi.egi.eu.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the next command is this:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server snapshot config-egi.egi.eu\n\n\n\n\n\nWith large repositories that can take a very long time, but with small repositories it should be very quick and not show any errors.\n\n\nVerifying that the replica is being served\n\n\nNow to verify that the replication is working, do the following commands:\n\n\nroot@host #\n wget -qdO- http://localhost:8000/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu/.cvmfspublished \n|\n cat -v\n\nroot@host #\n wget -qdO- http://localhost:80/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu/.cvmfspublished \n|\n cat -v\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth commands should show a short file including gibberish at the end which is the signature.\n\n\nIt is a good idea to familiarize yourself with the log entries at \n/var/log/httpd/access_log\n and also, if you have installed frontier-squid, at \n/var/log/squid/access.log\n. Also, at least 15 minutes after the snapshot is finished, check the log \n/var/log/cvmfs/snapshots.log\n to see that it tried to get an update and got no errors.\n\n\nSetting up monitoring\n\n\nIf you installed frontier-squid and frontier-awstats, there is a little more to do to configure monitoring.\n\n\nFirst, make sure that your firewall accepts UDP queries from the monitoring server at CERN. Details are in \nthe frontier-squid instructions\n. Next, choose any random password and put it in \n/etc/awstats/password-file\n. Then tell Dave Dykstra the fully qualified domain name of your machine and the password you chose, and he'll set up the monitoring servers.",

It describes the usage of tools provided by the Open Science Grid to evaluate the network performance between resources.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe Network Performance Toolkit is a collection of applications provided by the \nperfSONAR project\n and distributed by the \nOpen Science Grid\n. The \nserver\n components of the Network Performance Toolkit have been installed on dedicated resources of the \nOpen Science Grid\n. Following \nclient\n tools are described in this document:\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Diagnostic Tool (NDT)\n\n\nOne Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)\n\n\nBandwidth Control tool (BWCTL)\n\n\nNetwork Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD)\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nClient Site Installation\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nNote that BWCTL is \ndeprecated\n\n\n\n\nThe Network Performance Toolkit is installed with the OSG Client. Specifically, the tools included are: BWCTL, NDT and OWAMP (bwctl-client, bwctl-server, bwctl, ndt, owamp-client). NPAD is currently not in OSG client.\n\n\nIf you just want to install the OSG command line clients you can do the following::\n\n\nyum install bwctl-client\n\n\nyum install owamp-client\n\n\nyum install ndt-client\n\n\nyum install npad-client\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may install these utilities separately as RPM using yum by following the \nperfSONAR\n instructions. The packages are in the OSG repository, some of them with a separate client or server version, available for the OSG supported platforms:\n\n\n\n\nNDT: ndt\n\n\nOWAMP: owamp, owamp-client, owamp-server\n\n\nBWCTL: bwctl, bwctl-client, bwctl-server\n\n\nNPAD: npad\n\n\n\n\nServer Site Installation\n\n\nThe \nperfSONAR\n-based tools and services support the following tasks for OSG VO's:\n\n\n\n\nmonitor site-to-site network paths and ensure that these paths remain operational\n\n\ntroubleshoot performance problems quickly and efficiently\n\n\n\n\nThe \nserver site components\n can be brought-up \non demand\n using the netinstall provided by \nperfSONAR project downloads\n. Source packages are provided on the \nperfSONAR home page\n.\n\n\nOnce the Toolkit server has booted you may begin on-demand testing. The server tools will use a generic set of configuration files. The intent is to make it easy to stand up a temporary server when and where it is needed. However, it is expected that a permanently installed server will be customized/configured, allowing it to support both on-demand testing and regularly scheduled monitoring. See the \nperfSONAR home page\n for step-by-step instructions on how to complete this customization process.\n\n\nFinding Target Servers\n\n\nFinding servers against which to run on-demand tests can be a major impediment to effectively using these tools. The \nperfSONAR\n project tackles this problem by running a registration service for participating tools. The Performance Node ISO automatically uses this Lookup Service to advertise the tools' existence. You can also create custom views by making web-service calls to retrieve the data of interest. \n\n\nWe also have requested ALL OSG sites register their perfSONAR Toolkit installations in \nOIM\n. Using this list you can select a \"closest\" relevant instance to use for running on-demand tests. Alternately if you have a perfSONAR toolkit install, the web interface has a \"Global Services\" link you can visit to see ALL perfSONAR instances that have updated the perfSONAR lookup service.\n\n\nUsing the Client Tools\n\n\nThese tools support delay measurements (OWAMP), throughput measurements (BWCTL), and advanced diagnostics (NDT and NPAD). The command syntax for each tool is described in the following sub-sections. Each of the client tools listed above communicates with a companion server process to perform a measurement/test.\n\n\nNetwork Diagnostic Tool (NDT)\n\n\nThe Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) runs a series of short tests to determine what the current performance is and what, if anything, is limiting that performance. It can distinguish between host configuration and network infrastructure problems. To diagnose the CE/SE configuration and network connection run the \nweb100clt\n command:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n web100clt \u2013n \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore details can be obtained by using the \n-l\n command line option to \nweb100ctl\n:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n web100clt \u2013n \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n -l\n\n\n\n\n\nTo increase the output further use:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n web100clt \u2013n \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n -ll\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)\n\n\nThe One Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) is an advanced version of the common \nping\n program. The OWAMP client \nowping\n communicates with an OWAMP server and measures the delay in each direction using NTP based time stamps. OWAMP can be used to identify delay, loss, and packet reordering problems inside the network. To measure the delay between the CE/SE and the remote server use the \nowping\n command:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n owping \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBandwidth Control tool (BWCTL)\n\n\nThe Bandwidth Control tool (BWCTL) is a wrapper for the \niperf\n command, its policy and a daemon. BWCTL improves the usability of \niperf\n by avoiding following problems:\n\n\n\n\nneed for remote access to the target host used for measurement\n\n\nsecurity concerns about leaving an \niperf\n daemon running on the target host\n\n\n\n\nBWCTL supports testing in either direction, or between 2 remote BWCTL servers from a third location. To measure the current throughput from your SE/CE to the remote server use the \nbwctl\n command:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n bwctl \u2013s \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird party tests, between 2 remote BWCTL servers, will let you measure various sections of the end-2-end path, running\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n bwctl \u2013c \n1st Server \nfor\n Measurement\n \u2013s \n2nd Server \nfor\n Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther useful options are \n-f\n, format, \n-t\n, length of test, and \n-i\n, test interval.\n\n\nNetwork Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD)\n\n\nNOTE: Network Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD) is deprecated and won't be in future versions of the OSG distribution\n\n\nThe Network Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD) tool examines a host and its local network infrastructure to determine what problems, if any, would hinder wide area performance. Issues such as small TCP buffers in switches and routers are detected as well as common host configuration errors. To determine if the CE/SE will achieve maximum performance over a WAN path run the command \ndiag-client\n:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n diag-client \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n \n8001\n \n10\n \n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe last 2 numeric parameters, after host and port, are the rtt time (in ms) and speed/rate values (in Mbps) you need to achieve. The reason it works this way is that its meant to 'test' local infrastructure. The idea is that if you were testing to an NPAD server that was 5ms away on a 1G network, you would get close to that speed even with network flaws. If you were to supply 80ms and 1G to the server and there truly was a flaw, the NPAD test would tell you it wasn't possible, thus enabling you to fix the problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \ndiag-client\n commands return a partial URL, enabling easy sharing of results between users and site administrators. To view the results, prepend the Toolkit servers name/port to the returned string. The example above would result in this URL: \nhttp://server.this.osg.domain:8002/ServerData/Reports-2011-07/vtbv-ce.uchicago.edu:2011-07-12-18:50:07.html\n.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Topic: Scheduled Monitoring\n\n\n(See \nhttp://docs.perfsonar.net/install_quick_start.html\n for more details.)\n\n\nIn addition to the above on-demand tests, the Performance Toolkit server can be configured to continuously monitor the throughput or delay between your site and peer sites of interest. To begin this monitoring, enter the GUI and ensure that your server is a member of the community or communities of interest. Once that is complete, continue on by selecting either the \nperfSONAR-BUOY\n throughput or delay configuration menu item.\n\n\npSB-throughput: This utility will run regularly scheduled BWCTL tests between your Toolkit server and the selected peer servers. Results are stored in a database and displayed on the server's web page. You may also use standard web-service calls to retrieve this data for display on remote web servers. This would allow monitoring of a common core infrastructure at a central site, while each site could keep local/customized views.\n\n\npSB-delay: This utility will run regularly scheduled OWAMP tests between your Toolkit server and the selected peers. Results are stored in a database and displayed on the server\u2019s web page. You may also use standard web-service calls to retrieve this data for display on remote web servers.

            "text": "Troubleshooting Gratia Accounting\n\n\nThis document will help you troubleshoot problems with the Gratia Accounting, particularly with problems in collecting and reporting accounting information to the central OSG accounting service.\n\n\nGratia/GRACC: The Big Picture\n\n\nGratia is software used in OSG to gather accounting information. The information is collected from individual resources at a site, such as a Compute Element or a a submission host. The program that collects the data is called a \"Gratia probe\". The information is transferred to a GRACC server. Most sites will choose to send the accounting data to the central OSG Gratia server, but you can also use a Gratia server at your site (which can send forward the data to the central OSG Gratia server). Here is a diagram:\n\n\n\n\nDifference between Gratia and GRACC\n\n\nGratia is the legacy name of the OSG Accounting system.  GRACC is the new name of the server and hosted components of the accounting system.  When we refer to Gratia, we mean either the data or the probes on the resources.  If we mention GRACC, we are referring to the hosted components that the OSG maintains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the definitions of the major elements in the above figure.\n\n\n\n\nGratia probe\n: A piece of software that collects accounting data from the computer on which it's running, and transmits it to a Gratia server.\n\n\nGRACC server\n: A server that collects Gratia accounting data from one or more sites and can share it with users via a web page.  The GRACC server is hosted by the OSG.\n\n\nReporter\n: A web service running on the GRACC server. Users can connect to the reporter via a web browser to explore the Gratia data.\n\n\nCollector\n: A web service running on the GRACC server that collects data from one or more Gratia probes. Users do not directly interact with the collector.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the OSG's GRACC website at \nhttps://gracc.opensciencegrid.org\n.\n\n\nYou can see a fancier version of the Gratia data at \nhttps://display.opensciencegrid.org/\n. This is \nnot\n running a Gratia collector, but is a separate service.\n\n\nGratia Probes\n\n\nGratia Probes are periodically run as cron jobs, but different probes will run at different intervals. The cron jobs will always run and you should not remove them. You can find them in \n/etc/cron.d\n.\n\n\nHowever, the cron jobs will only do anything if you have enabled them. You enable them via an init script. For example, to enable them:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service gratia-probes-cron start\n\nEnabling gratia probes cron:                               [  \nOK\n  ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo disable them:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service gratia-probes-cron stop\n\nDisabling gratia probes cron:                               [  \nOK\n  ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also need to enable individual probes, usually via \nosg-configure\n.  Documentation on using \nosg-configure\n with Gratia \ndocumented elsewhere\n.\n\n\nRunning Gratia Probes\n\n\nWhen the cron jobs are enabled and run, they go through the following process, with minor changes between different Gratia probes:\n\n\n\n\nThe probe is invoked. It reads its configuration from \n/etc/gratia/\nPROBE-NAME\n/ProbeConfig\n.\n\n\nIt collects the accounting information from the underlying system. For example, the Condor probe will read it from the \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n, which is usually \n/var/lib/gratia/data\n.\n\n\nIt transforms the data into Gratia records and saves them into \n/var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/\n\n\nWhen there are sufficient Gratia records, or when sufficient time has passed, it uploads sets of records in batches to the GRACC server, then removes them from the \ngratiafiles\n directory.\n\n\nAll progress is logged to \n/var/log/gratia\n.\n\n\nIf there are failures in uploading the files to the GRACC server\n\n\nFiles are not removed from \ngratiafiles\n until they are successfully uploaded.\n\n\nErrors are logged to log files in \n/var/log/gratia\n.\n\n\nThe uploads will be tried again later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGratia Probe Configuration\n\n\nIn normal cases, \nosg-configure\n does the editing of the probe configuration files, at least on the CE. The configuration is found in \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-gratia.ini\n and \ndocumented elsewhere\n.\n\n\nIf there are problems or special configuration, you might need to edit the Gratia configuration files yourself. Each probe has a separate configuration file found in \n/etc/gratia/\nPROBE-NAME\n/ProbeConfig\n.\n\n\nThe ProbeConfig files have many details. A few options that you might need to edit are shown before. This is \nnot\n a complete file, but only shows a subset of the options.\n\n\nProbeConfiguration \n\n    CollectorHost=\ngratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80\n\n    SSLHost=\ngratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80\n\n    SSLRegistrationHost=\ngratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80\n\n\n    ProbeName=\ncondor:fermicloud084.fnal.gov\n\n    SiteName=\nWISC_OSG_EDU\n\n    EnableProbe=\n1\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe options you see here are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollectorHost\n\n\nThe GRACC server this probe reports to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSLHost\n\n\nThe GRACC server this probe reports to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSLRegistrationHost\n\n\nThe GRACC server this probe reports to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbeName\n\n\nThe unique name for this probe. Note that it includes the probe type and the host name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiteName\n\n\nThe name of your site, as registered in OIM. If your site must be registered in OIM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnableProbe\n\n\nThe probe will only run if this is \"1\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, there are many more options in this file. Most of the time you won't need to touch them.\n\n\nAre the Gratia cron jobs running?\n\n\nYou should make sure the Gratia cron jobs are running. The simplest way is with the \nservice\n command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service gratia-probes-cron status\n\ngratia probes cron is enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it is not enabled, enable it as described above.\n\n\nA future release of Gratia will provide status on each of the individual probes, but right now this only ensures that the basic cron job is running. In the meantime, you can check if the individual Gratia probes are enabled. To do this, look at the \nEnableProbe\n option in the \nProbeConfig\n file, as described above. A quick command to do this is shown here. Note that the Condor and GridFTP Transfer probes are enabled while the glexec probe is disabled:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \ncd\n /etc/gratia\n\nroot@host #\n grep -r EnableProbe *\n\ncondor/ProbeConfig:    EnableProbe=\n1\n\n\nglexec/ProbeConfig:    EnableProbe=\n0\n\n\ngridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig:    EnableProbe=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see no log files in \n/var/log/gratia\n you may have an error in the probe configuration file. Manually run the test for your probe (check \n/etc/cron.d/gratia-probe-condor.cron\n), e.g. \n/usr/share/gratia/common/cron_check  /etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n. If there is an error you may get a suggestion on where it is, e.g.:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /usr/share/gratia/common/cron_check  /etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n\nParse error in /etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig: not well-formed (invalid token): line 21, column 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect the error and restart gratia.\n\n\nHave you configured the resource names correctly?\n\n\nDo the names of your resources match the names in \nOIM\n?\nGratia retrieves the resource name from the \nSite Information\n section of the \n/etc/osg/config.d/40-siteinfo.ini\n\n\n;\n===================================================================\n\n\n;\n                       \nSite\n \nInformation\n\n\n;\n===================================================================\n\n\n\n[\nSite\n \nInformation\n]\n\n\n;\n \nThe\n \ngroup\n \noption\n \nindicates\n \nthe\n \ngroup\n \nthat\n \nthe\n \nOSG\n \nsite\n \nshould\n \nbe\n \nlisted\n \nin\n,\n\n\n;\n \nfor\n \nproduction\n \nsites\n \nthis\n \nshould\n \nbe\n \nOSG\n,\n \nfor\n \nvtb\n \nor\n \nitb\n \ntesting\n \nit\n \nshould\n \nbe\n\n\n;\n \nOSG\n-\nITB\n\n\n;\n \n\n;\n \nYOU\n \nWILL\n \nNEED\n \nTO\n \nCHANGE\n \nTHIS\n\n\ngroup\n \n=\n \nOSG\n\n\n\n;\n \nThe\n \nhost_name\n \nsetting\n \nshould\n \ngive\n \nthe\n \nhost\n \nname\n \nof\n \nthe\n \nCE\n  \nthat\n \nis\n \nbeing\n \n\n;\n \nconfigured\n,\n \nthis\n \nsetting\n \nmust\n \nbe\n \na\n \nvalid\n \ndns\n \nname\n \nthat\n \nresolves\n\n\n;\n \n\n;\n \nYOU\n \nWILL\n \nNEED\n \nTO\n \nCHANGE\n \nTHIS\n\n\nhost_name\n \n=\n \ntusker\n-\ngw1\n.\nunl\n.\nedu\n\n\n\n;\n \nThe\n \nresource\n \nsetting\n \nshould\n \nbe\n \nset\n \nto\n \nthe\n \nsame\n \nvalue\n \nas\n \nused\n \nin\n \nthe\n \nOIM\n \n\n;\n \nregistration\n \nat\n \nthe\n \ngoc\n \n\n;\n \n\n;\n \nYOU\n \nWILL\n \nNEED\n \nTO\n \nCHANGE\n \nTHIS\n\n\nresource\n \n=\n \nTusker\n-\nCE1\n\n\n\n;\n \nThe\n \nresource_group\n \nsetting\n \nshould\n \nbe\n \nset\n \nto\n \nthe\n \nsame\n \nvalue\n \nas\n \nused\n \nin\n \nthe\n \nOIM\n \n\n;\n \nregistration\n \nat\n \nthe\n \ngoc\n \n\n;\n \n\n;\n \nYOU\n \nWILL\n \nNEED\n \nTO\n \nCHANGE\n \nTHIS\n\n\nresource_group\n \n=\n \nTusker\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo those names match the names that you registered with OIM?

When the site name changes, you need to ask the GRACC operations team to update the name of your site at the GRACC collector. To do this:\n\n\n\n\nOpen a ticket at \nthe GOC ticket web page\n\n\nSelect \"Software or Service\"\n\n\nSelect \"GRACC Operations\"\n\n\nType a friendly email that asks the GRACC team to change your site name at the collector. Make sure to tell them the old name and the new name.  Below is an example email:\nHello GRACC Team,\n\nPlease change the site name of my site from \nlt;Insert Old Name\ngt; to \nlt;Insert New Name\ngt;.\n\nThanks, ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs a site reporting data?\n\n\nYou can see if the OSG GRACC Server is getting data from a site by going to \nGRACC\n:\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the site name in Facility\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor's Gratia Configuration\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOnly applicable to HTCondor batch sites, not SLURM, PBS, SGE or LSF sites\n\n\n\n\nCondor must be configured to put information about each job into a special directory.  Gratia will read and remove the files in order to collect the accounting information.\n\n\nThe configuration variable is called \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n. If you install the OSG RPM for Condor, the Gratia probe will extend its configuration by adding a file to \n/etc/condor/config.d\n, and will set this variable to \n/var/lib/gratia/data\n. If you are using a different installation method, you may need to set the variable yourself. You can check if it's set by using \ncondor_config_val\n, like this:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_config_val -v PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR: /var/lib/gratia/data\n\n\n    Defined in \n/etc/condor/config.d/99_gratia.conf\n, line 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set this value, you need to restart condor:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_restart\n\nSent \nRestart\n command to local master\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike many Condor settings, a \ncondor_reconfig\n is not sufficient - you must restart!\n\n\nIf you accidentally did not set \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n (see above)\n\n\nThe HTCondor Gratia probe will not publish accounting information about jobs without \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n. You can have Gratia read the Condor history file and publish data that way. If you know the time period of the missing data, you should specify a start and end times. This reduces the load on the Gratia collector.

There are a few things you need to do. But first, you need to understand exactly where Gratia stores files.\n\n\nWhen a Gratia extracts accounting information, it creates one file per record and stores it in a directory. The directory is a long name that contains the type of the probe (such as \ncondor\n), the name of the host you're running on, and the name of the GRACC host you're sending the information to. For simplicity, lets call that name \nprobe-records\n, but you'll see what it really looks like below. Within this directory, you'll see some subdirectories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectory\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/lib/gratia/tmp/grataifiles/\nprobe-records\n/outbox\n\n\nThe usual location for the accounting records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/lib/gratia/tmp/grataifiles/\nprobe-records\n/staged/store\n\n\nAn overflow location when there are problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you recover old records, you need to:\n\n\n\n\nMove files from the outbox of the incorrect \nprobe-records\n directory into the outbox of the correctly named \nprobe-records\n directory.\n\n\nMove tarred and compressed files from the staged/store of the incorrect \nprobe-records\n directory into the staged/store of the correctly named \nprobe-records\n directory. Then you uncompress them and remove the compressed version.\n\n\n\n\nIn the examples below, the hostname for gratia was \"accidentally\" spelled backwards. Instead of \ngratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org\n, it was \naitarg-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst you need to fix the hostname. For a CE, you can edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-gratia.ini\n and rerun \nosg-configure -c\n. In other installations, you have to edit the appropriate \nProbeConfig\n file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, submit a job via to your batch system, then run the appropriate Gratia probe (or wait for it to run via cron). This will create the properly named directories on your disk.

The information is collected from individual resources at a site, such as a Compute Element or a a submission host. The program that collects the data is called a \"Gratia probe\". The information is transferred to a GRACC server. Most sites will choose to send the accounting data to the central OSG Gratia server, but you can also use a Gratia server at your site (which can send forward the data to the central OSG Gratia server). Here is a diagram:   Difference between Gratia and GRACC  Gratia is the legacy name of the OSG Accounting system.  GRACC is the new name of the server and hosted components of the accounting system.  When we refer to Gratia, we mean either the data or the probes on the resources.  If we mention GRACC, we are referring to the hosted components that the OSG maintains.    These are the definitions of the major elements in the above figure.   Gratia probe : A piece of software that collects accounting data from the computer on which it's running, and transmits it to a Gratia server.  GRACC server : A server that collects Gratia accounting data from one or more sites and can share it with users via a web page.  The GRACC server is hosted by the OSG.  Reporter : A web service running on the GRACC server. Users can connect to the reporter via a web browser to explore the Gratia data.  Collector : A web service running on the GRACC server that collects data from one or more Gratia probes. Users do not directly interact with the collector.   You can see the OSG's GRACC website at  https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org .  You can see a fancier version of the Gratia data at  https://display.opensciencegrid.org/ .

The directory is a long name that contains the type of the probe (such as  condor ), the name of the host you're running on, and the name of the GRACC host you're sending the information to. For simplicity, lets call that name  probe-records , but you'll see what it really looks like below. Within this directory, you'll see some subdirectories:     Directory  Purpose      /var/lib/gratia/tmp/grataifiles/ probe-records /outbox  The usual location for the accounting records    /var/lib/gratia/tmp/grataifiles/ probe-records /staged/store  An overflow location when there are problems     When you recover old records, you need to:   Move files from the outbox of the incorrect  probe-records  directory into the outbox of the correctly named  probe-records  directory.  Move tarred and compressed files from the staged/store of the incorrect  probe-records  directory into the staged/store of the correctly named  probe-records  directory. Then you uncompress them and remove the compressed version.   In the examples below, the hostname for gratia was \"accidentally\" spelled backwards. Instead of  gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org , it was  aitarg-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org .    First you need to fix the hostname. For a CE, you can edit  /etc/osg/config.d/30-gratia.ini  and rerun  osg-configure -c . In other installations, you have to edit the appropriate  ProbeConfig  file.    Next, submit a job via to your batch system, then run the appropriate Gratia probe (or wait for it to run via cron). This will create the properly named directories on your disk. For example:  As a user:   user@host $  globus-job-run fermicloud084.fnal.gov/jobmanager-condor /bin/hostname  As root (adjust for your batch system):   root@host #  /share/gratia/condor/condor \\_ meter    Find the Gratia records that can be easily uploaded. They are located in a a directory with an unwieldly name that includes your hostname and the incorrect name of the Gratia host. You can see the directory name in the Gratia log: the misspelled name is noted in red below, but  it will be different on your computer .  user@host $  less /var/log/gratia/2012-04-06 ...  16:04:29 CDT Gratia: Response indicates failure, the following files will not be deleted:  16:04:29 CDT Gratia:    /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/      subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_ aitarg -osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/      outbox/r.916.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_aitarg-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80.gratia.xml__JDlHbNb918   (The filename was wrapped for legibility.)  You can simply copy these to the correct directory. Wait for the Gratia cron job to run, or force it to run.  root@host #   cd  /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_ aitarg -osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/outbox/. root@host #  mv * /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_ gratia -osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/outbox/.    If this has been a persistent problem, you might have many records. After a while, they are put into a compressed files in another directory. You can move those files, then uncompress them. This is a long name: note that the path ends in \"staged/store\" instead of \"outbox\" as above:  % RED%# Find the old files  root@host #   cd  /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_ aitarg -osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/staged/store % RED%# Move them to the correct directory  root@host #  mv tz* /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_ gratia -osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/outbox/. root@host #   cd  !$ % RED%# For each tz file:  root@host #  tar xf tz.1223....

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nDue to the central RSV service retirement (see \nthis document\n for details),\nthe new version of RSV will disable the \ngratia-consumer\n component that reports to the central service.\nPlease update \nall\n RSV packages by running the following command on your RSV host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update rsv\n\\*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you are using osg-configure, please edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and set the following:\n\n\nenable_gratia = False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

Glidein lifetime is no longer based on the length of the proxy  New option to kill glideins when the number of job requests drop  Estimate in advance how many cores will be provided to glideins  Add entry monitoring breakdown for metasites  Review Factory and Frontend tools, especially glidien_off and manual_glidein_submit.py  Singularity improvements  Use PATH and module when SINGULARITY_BIN does not contain the correct path  Run in a separate session to support restricted-access CVMFS      Notes   All nodes  GLIDEIN_ToDie is no longer shortened depending on the X509 proxy lifetime, to get the old behavior set GLIDEIN_Ignore_X509_Duration to False  The type of the GLIDEIN_CPU attr is String (to accomodate the keywords auto, slot, node). It was incorrectly documented as type Int. Make sure your configuration uses the correct type or you may get a reconfig/upgrade error.    Factory only:  If you use HTCondor 8.7.2 or later with the GlideinWMS Factory, then GRAM gateways are no longer supported  'entry_sets' should be considered an experimental feature: the implementation will change in 3.4.1 and there may be errors and manual interventions required when upgrading to new versions of GlideinWMS if metasites are configured        BLAHP: Improved security      These  JIRA tickets  were addressed in this release.   Notes   OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.  StashCache is supported on EL7 only.  xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.    Detailed changes are below.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nDue to the central RSV service retirement (see \nthis document\n for details),\nthe new version of RSV will disable the \ngratia-consumer\n component that reports to the central service.\nPlease update \nall\n RSV packages by running the following command on your RSV host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update rsv\n\\*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you are using osg-configure, please edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and set the following:\n\n\nenable_gratia = False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

This new format first appeared in OSG PKI tools version 2.1.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nDue to the central RSV service retirement (see \nthis document\n for details),\nthe new version of RSV will disable the \ngratia-consumer\n component that reports to the central service.\nPlease update \nall\n RSV packages by running the following command on your RSV host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update rsv\n\\*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you are using osg-configure, please edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and set the following:\n\n\nenable_gratia = False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

This new format first appeared in OSG PKI tools version 2.1.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository. Note that in some cases, there are multiple RPMs for each package. You can click on any given package to see the set of RPMs or see the complete list below.\n\n\nEnterprise Linux 6\n\n\n\n\nosg-version-3.4.11-1.osg34.el6\n\n\nsingularity-2.5.0-1.1.osg34.el6\n\n\n\n\nEnterprise Linux 7\n\n\n\n\nosg-version-3.4.11-1.osg34.el7\n\n\nsingularity-2.5.0-1.1.osg34.el7\n\n\n\n\nRPMs\n\n\nIf you wish to manually update your system, you can run yum update against the following packages:\n\n\nosg-version singularity singularity-debuginfo singularity-devel singularity-runtime\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to only update the RPMs that changed, the set of RPMs is:\n\n\nEnterprise Linux 6\n\n\nosg-version-3.4.11-1.osg34.el6\nsingularity-2.5.0-1.1.osg34.el6\nsingularity-debuginfo-2.5.0-1.1.osg34.el6\nsingularity-devel-2.5.0-1.1.osg34.el6\nsingularity-runtime-2.5.0-1.1.osg34.el6\n\n\n\n\n\nEnterprise Linux 7\n\n\nosg-version-3.4.11-1.osg34.el7\nsingularity-2.5.0-1.1.osg34.el7\nsingularity-debuginfo-2.5.0-1.1.osg34.el7\nsingularity-devel-2.5.0-1.1.osg34.el7\nsingularity-runtime-2.5.0-1.1.osg34.el7",

            "text": "This release contains:   Singularity 2.5.0  This release includes fixes for several high and medium severity security issues.\n  It also contains a number of bug fixes including the much awaited docker aufs whiteout file fix.\n  It's a new release instead of a point release because it adds a new dependency to handle this bug,\n  includes some new (albeit minor) feature enhancements, and changes the behavior of a few environment variables.  Singularity 2.5 should be installed immediately and all previous versions of Singularity should be removed.\n  Many of the vulnerabilities fixed in this release are expected to affect all Linux distributions\n  regardless of whether they implement overlayfs.\n  There are no mitigations or workarounds for these issues outside of updating Singularity.     These  JIRA tickets  were addressed in this release.   Notes   OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.  StashCache is supported on EL7 only.  xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.  OSG PKI tools now create service certificate files where the service tag is separated from the hostname with an underscore ( _ ). This new format first appeared in OSG PKI tools version 2.1.2.

Notes   OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.  StashCache is supported on EL7 only.  xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.  OSG PKI tools now create service certificate files where the service tag is separated from the hostname with an underscore ( _ ). This new format first appeared in OSG PKI tools version 2.1.2.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.

Notes   OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.  StashCache is supported on EL7 only.  xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.  OSG PKI tools now create service certificate files where the service tag is separated from the hostname with an underscore ('_'). This new format first appeared in OSG PKI tools version 2.1.2.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the November release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the October release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository. Note that in some cases, there are multiple RPMs for each package.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

This option must be used when the disambiguation code does not correctly determine which PBS is in use.\n\n\nReorganize the osg-ce packages \nSOFTWARE-2768\n\n\nUpcoming: patched HTCondor 8.7.2\n\n\nUpdated SELinux profile which is required on Red Hat 7.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.\n\n\nStashCache is supported on EL7 only.\n\n\nxrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details.\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the August release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details.\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the August release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.

Specifically, the varied authentication solutions proved to be good candidates for consolidation and a new piece of software, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, has been designed to replace both edg-mkgridmap and GUMS.\n\n\nSee \ninstall the LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n to replace GUMS + edg-mkgridmap.\n\n\nSee \nmigrating from edg-mkgridmap to lcmaps VOMS plugin\n to transistion from edg-mkgridmap.\n\n\nIn 3.4.0, we dropped HDFS 2.x with the intention of adding HDFS 3.x in a subsequent OSG 3.4 release when it becomes available upstream.\n\n\nIn addition to GUMS, edg-mkgridmap, and HDFS 2.x, we dropped packages related to the following software:\n\n\n\n\nVOMS Admin Server - \nRetirement Policy\n\n\nBeStMan - replaced by \nLoad Balanced GridFTP\n\n\nGLExec - replaced by \nSingularty\n\n\nGlobus GRAM available from EPEL\n\n\nGIP and OSG Info Services BDII servers retired\n\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned packages are still be available in OSG 3.3 and will receive regular support until December 2017 and security updates until June 2018 per our \nrelease policy\n. See \nthis section\n for the complete list of packages removed from OSG 3.4.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.\n\n\nStashCache is supported on EL7 only.\n\n\nxrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of changes\n\n\nThis release contains:\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4.0\n\n\nHTCondor 8.6.3\n: See \nUpgrading from 8.4\n for additional information\n\n\nFrontier squid 3.5.24-3.1\n: See \nUpgrading from 2.x to 3.x\n for additional information\n\n\nUpdate to \nXRootD 4.6.1\n\n\nUpdate to xrootd-lcmaps 1.3.3 for EL7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate StashCache meta-packages to require XRootD 4.6.1\n\n\nUpdate to \nGlideinWMS 3.2.19\n\n\nMake the LCMAPS VOMS plugin consider only the first FQAN to be consistent with GUMS\n\n\nHTCondor-CE: Add WholeNodeWanted ClassAd expression so jobs can request a whole node from the batch system\n\n\nHTCondor 8.6.3\n: See \nUpgrading from 8.4\n for additional information\n\n\nOSG CE 3.4\n\n\nAdd vo-client-lcmaps-voms dependency\n\n\nRemove gridftp dependency\n\n\nDrop client tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd vo-client-lcmaps-voms dependency to osg-gridftp\n\n\nFix osg-update-vos script to clean yum cache in order pick up the latest vo-client RPM\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts now refers to repo.grid.iu.edu (rather than the retired software.grid.iu.edu)\n\n\nosg-configure 2.0.0\n\n\nreject empty \nallowed_vos\n in subclusters\n\n\nget default \nallowed_vos\n from LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n\n\nissue warning (rather than error out) if OSG_APP or OSG_DATA directories are not present\n\n\ndrop 'RSV is not installed' warning\n\n\nremove configure-osg alias\n\n\ndeprecate GUMS support\n\n\ndisable GRAM configuration\n\n\ndrop managedfork and network modules\n\n\ndrop glexec support\n\n\nremove nonfunctional osg-cleanup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrop glexec and java from osg-wn-client\n\n\nBeSTMan 2 is no longer part of the OSG Software Stack\n\n\nGUMS is no longer part of the OSG Software Stack\n\n\nedg-mkgridmap in no longer part of the OSG Software Stack\n\n\nDrop bestman2 and globus*run RSV metrics\n\n\nosg-build 1.10.0\n\n\ndrop vdt-build alias\n\n\ndrop ~/.osg-build.ini configuration file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, OSG 3.4 CEs cannot be configured to authenticate via GUMS (\nSOFTWARE-2482\n). This issue is expected to be fixed in the July release.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the July release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

            "text": "The OSG 3.4.0 software stack features a more streamlined and consolidated package list. Specifically, the varied authentication solutions proved to be good candidates for consolidation and a new piece of software, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, has been designed to replace both edg-mkgridmap and GUMS.  See  install the LCMAPS VOMS plugin  to replace GUMS + edg-mkgridmap.  See  migrating from edg-mkgridmap to lcmaps VOMS plugin  to transistion from edg-mkgridmap.  In 3.4.0, we dropped HDFS 2.x with the intention of adding HDFS 3.x in a subsequent OSG 3.4 release when it becomes available upstream.  In addition to GUMS, edg-mkgridmap, and HDFS 2.x, we dropped packages related to the following software:   VOMS Admin Server -  Retirement Policy  BeStMan - replaced by  Load Balanced GridFTP  GLExec - replaced by  Singularty  Globus GRAM available from EPEL  GIP and OSG Info Services BDII servers retired   The aforementioned packages are still be available in OSG 3.3 and will receive regular support until December 2017 and security updates until June 2018 per our  release policy . See  this section  for the complete list of packages removed from OSG 3.4.   Notes   OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.  StashCache is supported on EL7 only.  xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.",

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.

            "text": "OSG Release Series\n\n\nAn OSG release series is a sequence of OSG software releases that are intended to provide a painless upgrade path. For example, the 3.2 release series contains OSG software 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and so forth. A release series corresponds to a set of Yum software repositories, including ones for development, testing, and production use. The Yum repositories for one release series are completely distinct from the repositories for a different release series, even though they share many common packages.  A particular release within a series is a snapshot of packages and their exact versions at one point in time. When you install software from a release series, say 3.2, you get the most current versions of software packages within that series, regardless of the current release version.\n\n\nWhen a new series is released, it is an opportunity for the OSG Technology area to add major new software packages, make substantial updates to existing packages, and remove obsolete packages. When a new series is initially released, most packages are identical to the previous release, but two adjacent series will diverge over time.\n\n\nOur goal is, within a series, that one may upgrade their OSG services via \nyum update\n cleanly and without any necessary config file changes or excessive downtime.\n\n\nOSG Release Series\n\n\nSince the start of the RPM-based OSG software stack, we have offered the following release series:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.1\n started in April 2012, and was end-of-lifed in April 2015. While the files have not been removed, it is strongly recommended that it not be installed anymore. Historically, there were 3.0.x releases as well, but there was no separate release series for 3.0 and 3.1; we simply went from 3.0.10 to 3.1.0 in the same repositories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.2\n started in November 2013, and was end-of-lifed in August 2016. While the files have not been removed, it is strongly recommended that it not be installed anymore. The main differences between it and 3.1 were the introduction of glideinWMS 3.2, HTCondor 8.0, and Hadoop/HDFS 2.0; also the gLite CE Monitor system was dropped in favor of osg-info-services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.3\n started in August 2015 and was end-of-lifed in May 2018. While the files have not been removed, it is strongly recommended that it not be installed anymore. The main differences between 3.3 and 3.2 are the dropping of EL5 support, the addition of EL7 support, and the dropping of Globus GRAM support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4\n started June 2017. The main differences between it and 3.3 are the removal of edg-mkgridmap, GUMS, BeStMan, and VOMS Admin Server packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG Upcoming\n\n\nThere is one more OSG Series called \"upcoming\" which contains major updates planned for a future release series. The yum repositories for upcoming (\nosg-upcoming\n and \nosg-upcoming-testing\n) are available from all OSG 3.x series, and individual packages can be installed from Upcoming without needing to update entirely to a new series. Note, however, that packages in the \"upcoming\" repositories are tested against the most recent OSG series.  As of the time of writing, \nosg-upcoming\n is meant to work with OSG 3.4.\n\n\nInstalling an OSG Release Series\n\n\nSee the \nyum repositories document\n for instructions on installing the OSG repositories.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating from OSG 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 to 3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have an existing installation based on OSG 3.1, 3.2, or 3.3 (which will be referred to as the \nold series\n), and want to upgrade to 3.4 (the \nnew series\n), we recommend the following procedure:\n\n\nFirst, remove the old series yum repositories:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -e osg-release\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step ensures that any local modifications to \n*.repo\n files will not prevent installing the new series repos. Any modified \n*.repo\n files should appear under \n/etc/yum.repos.d/\n with the \n*.rpmsave\n extension. After installing the new OSG repositories (the next step) you may want to apply any changes made in the \n*.rpmsave\n files to the new \n*.repo\n files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the OSG repositories:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -Uvh \nlt\n;\nURL\ngt\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nURL\n is one of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeries\n\n\nEL6 URL (for RHEL6, CentOS6, or SL6)\n\n\nEL7 URL (for RHEL7, CentOS7, or SL7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4\n\n\nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.4/osg-3.4-el6-release-latest.rpm\n\n\nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.4/osg-3.4-el7-release-latest.rpm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will update \nall\n packages on your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n If you are not having the expected result or having problems with Yum please see the \nYum troubleshooting guide\n\n\nRetiring Your VOMS Server\n\n\nDue to the \nend of OSG 3.3 support\n, VOMS Admin server is\nno longer supported in the OSG as of May 2018.\nPlease see \nthis policy document\n for details on the\nVOMS Admin retirement.\n\n\nThis section describes how to gracefully retire your VOMS host.\n\n\nDisabling the VOMS Admin service\n\n\nThe VOMS Admin service provides a web interface to manage membership of your virtual organization (VO).\nIt also handles queries for the list of VO members, which may have\n\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation\n implications.\nTherefore, the VOMS Admin service should be disabled immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the service name based on your OS version for subsequent steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your host OS is...\n\n\nThen the service name is...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEL6\n\n\ntomcat6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEL7\n\n\ntomcat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn off and disable the VOMS Admin server webapp:\n\n\nroot@voms #\n service \nlt\n;\nSERVICE NAME\ngt\n;\n stop\n\nroot@voms #\n chkconfig disable \nlt\n;\nSERVICE NAME\ngt\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisabling the VOMS service\n\n\nThe VOMS service accepts requests from clients to sign the VOMS attributes of their proxies.\nThese VOMS attributes can then be used to authorize job submissions and file transfers in the OSG.\n\n\nBefore turning off the VOMS service, it is important to migrate any clients to avoid disruption of your VO's workflows.\n\n\nIdentifying VOMS clients\n\n\nTo find all clients requesting VOMS attribute signatures, run the following command:\n\n\nroot@voms #\n awk -F \n:\n \n/Received request from/ {print $11}\n \n\\\n\n    /var/log/voms/voms.\nVO\n \n\\\n\n    /var/log/voms/voms.\nVO\n.\n[\n0\n-9\n]\n \n|\n sort \n|\n uniq -c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are any GlideinWMS frontends requesting VOMS attribute signatures:\n\n\n\n\nSecurely copy the VOMS certificate and key to the frontend host(s)\n\n\nConfigure the GlideinWMS frontend to directly sign the VOMS attributes of the pilot proxies using the\ninstructions in \nthis section\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are any VO users requesting VOMS attribute signatures: contact them to tell them that they will need to\n  generate proxies differently after the VOMS server retirement using one of the following commands:\n\n\n\n\nuser@host $ voms-proxy-init\n\n\nuser@host$ grid-proxy-init\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinalizing the VOMS retirement\n\n\nWhen you have migrated all clients off of your VOMS server, it is safe to turn off and disable the VOMS service:\n\n\nroot@voms #\n service voms stop\n\nroot@voms #\n chkconfig disable voms\n\n\n\n\n\nMigrating from edg-mkgridmap to LCMAPS VOMS Plugin\n\n\nAfter following the update instructions above, perform the migration process documented \nhere\n.\n\n\nUpdating from Frontier Squid 2.7 to Frontier Squid 3.5 (upgrading from OSG 3.3)\n\n\nThe program \nfrontier-squid\n received a major version upgrade (versions 2.7 to 3.5) between OSG 3.3 and OSG 3.4. Follow the \nupstream upgrade documentation\n when transitioning your squid server to OSG 3.4.\n\n\nUninstalling BeStMan2 from the Storage Element (upgrading to OSG 3.4)\n\n\nThe program BeStMan2 is no longer available in OSG 3.4 and its functionality has been replaced by \nload-balanced GridFTP\n. To update your storage element to OSG 3.4, you must perform the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that OSG BeStMan packages are installed:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -q osg-se-bestman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop the \nbestman2\n service:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service bestman2 stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUninstall the software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum erase bestman2-tester-libs bestman2-common-libs \n\\\n\n                            bestman2-server-libs bestman2-server-dep-libs \n\\\n\n                            bestman2-client-libs bestman2-tester bestman2-client \n\\\n\n                            bestman2-server osg-se-bestman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn the output from this command, yum should \nnot\n list other packages than those nine. If it lists other packages, cancel the erase operation, make sure the other packages are updated to their latest OSG 3.3 versions, and try again.\n\n\n\n\nAfter successfully removing BeStMan2, continue updating your host to OSG 3.4 by following the instructions above.\n\n\nUninstalling OSG Info Services from the Compute Element (upgrading from OSG 3.3 or 3.2)\n\n\nThe program OSG Info Services is no longer required on OSG 3.3, and is no longer available starting in OSG 3.4. This is because the service that OSG Info Services reported to, named BDII, has been retired and is no longer functional.\n\n\nTo cleanly uninstall OSG Info Services from your CE, perform the following procedure (after following the main update instructions above):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that you are using a sufficiently new version of the \nosg-ce\n metapackages:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -q osg-ce\n\n\n\n\n\nshould be at least 3.4-1 (OSG 3.4).  If not, update them:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update osg-ce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop the \nosg-info-services\n service:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service osg-info-services stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUninstall the software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum erase gip osg-info-services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn the output from this command, yum should \nnot\n list other packages than those two. If it lists other packages, cancel the erase operation, make sure the other packages are updated to their latest OSG 3.4 versions, and try again.\n\n\n\n\nUninstalling CEMon from the Compute Element (upgrading from OSG 3.1)\n\n\nThe program CEMon (found in the package \nglite-ce-monitor\n) is no longer available starting in OSG 3.2. Its functionality is no longer required because the service that CEMon reported to has been retired and is no longer functional.\n\n\nTo cleanly uninstall CEMon from your CE, perform the following procedure (after following the main update instructions above):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that you are using a sufficiently new version of the \nosg-ce\n metapackages:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -q osg-ce\n\n\n\n\n\nshould be at least 3.4-1 (OSG 3.4). If not, update them:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update osg-ce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there is a CEMon configuration file at \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-cemon.ini\n, remove it.\n\n\n\n\nRemove CEMon and related packages:\nroot@host #\n yum erase glite-ce-monitor glite-ce-osg-ce-plugin osg-configure-cemon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn the output from this command, yum should \nnot\n list other packages than those three. If it lists other packages, cancel the erase operation, make sure the other packages are updated to their OSG 3.4 versions (they should have \n.osg34\n in their versions), and try again.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nYum repositories\n\n\nBasic use of Yum",

Its functionality is no longer required because the service that CEMon reported to has been retired and is no longer functional.  To cleanly uninstall CEMon from your CE, perform the following procedure (after following the main update instructions above):    Ensure that you are using a sufficiently new version of the  osg-ce  metapackages:  root@host #  rpm -q osg-ce  should be at least 3.4-1 (OSG 3.4). If not, update them:  root@host #  yum update osg-ce    If there is a CEMon configuration file at  /etc/osg/config.d/30-cemon.ini , remove it.   Remove CEMon and related packages: root@host #  yum erase glite-ce-monitor glite-ce-osg-ce-plugin osg-configure-cemon     Note  In the output from this command, yum should  not  list other packages than those three. If it lists other packages, cancel the erase operation, make sure the other packages are updated to their OSG 3.4 versions (they should have  .osg34  in their versions), and try again.",

OSG uses RPMs (the Red Hat Packaging Manager) to package its software. While RPM is the packaging format, \nyum\n is the command you will use to do the installation. For example, \nyum\n will resolve and download the dependencies for the package you want to install; \nrpm\n will simply complain if you want to install a package that does not have all its dependencies installed.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nInstallation is done with the \nyum install\n command. Each of the individual installation guide shows you the correct command to use to do an installation. Here is an example installation with all of the output from yum.\n\n\nroot@host #\n sudo yum install osg-ca-certs\n\nLoaded plugins: kernel-module, priorities\n\n\nepel                                                                                         | 3.7 kB     00:00     \n\n\nepel/primary_db                                                                              | 3.8 MB     00:00     \n\n\nfermi-base                                                                                   | 2.1 kB     00:00     \n\n\nfermi-base/primary_db                                                                        |  48 kB     00:00     \n\n\nfermi-security                                                                               | 1.9 kB     00:00     \n\n\nfermi-security/primary_db                                                                    | 1.7 MB     00:00     \n\n\nosg                                                                                          | 1.9 kB     00:00     \n\n\nosg/primary_db                                                                               |  65 kB     00:00     \n\n\nsl-base                                                                                      | 2.1 kB     00:00     \n\n\nsl-base/primary_db                                                                           | 2.0 MB     00:00     \n\n\n957 packages excluded due to repository priority protections\n\n\nSetting up Install Process\n\n\nResolving Dependencies\n\n\n--\n Running transaction check\n\n\n---\n Package osg-ca-certs.noarch 0:1.23-1 set to be updated\n\n\n--\n Finished Dependency Resolution\n\n\nBeginning Kernel Module Plugin\n\n\nFinished Kernel Module Plugin\n\n\n\nDependencies Resolved\n\n\n\n====================================================================================================================\n\n\n Package                         Arch                      Version                     Repository              Size\n\n\n====================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstalling:\n\n\n osg-ca-certs                    noarch                    1.23-1                      osg                    450 k\n\n\n\nTransaction Summary\n\n\n====================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstall       1 Package(s)\n\n\nUpgrade       0 Package(s)\n\n\n\nTotal download size: 450 k\n\n\nIs this ok [y/N]: y\n\n\nDownloading Packages:\n\n\nosg-ca-certs-1.23-1.noarch.rpm                                                               | 450 kB     00:00     \n\n\nwarning: rpmts_HdrFromFdno: Header V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 824b8603\n\n\nosg/gpgkey                                                                                   | 1.7 kB     00:00     \n\n\nImporting GPG key 0x824B8603 \nOSG Software Team (RPM Signing Key for Koji Packages) \nvdt-support@opensciencegrid.org\n from /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-OSG\n\n\nIs this ok [y/N]: y\n\n\nRunning rpm_check_debug\n\n\nRunning Transaction Test\n\n\nFinished Transaction Test\n\n\nTransaction Test Succeeded\n\n\nRunning Transaction\n\n\n  Installing     : osg-ca-certs                                                                                 1/1 \n\n\n\nInstalled:\n\n\n  osg-ca-certs.noarch 0:1.23-1                                                                                      \n\n\n\nComplete!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease Note\n: When you first install a package from the OSG repository, you will be prompted to import the GPG key. We use this key to sign our RPMs as a security measure. You should double-check the key id (above it is 824B8603) with the \ninformation on our signed RPMs\n. If it doesn't match, there is a problem somewhere and you should report it to the OSG via help@opensciencegrid.org.\n\n\nVerifying Packages and Installations\n\n\nYou can check if an RPM has been modified. For instance, to check to see if any files have been modified in the \nosg-ca-certs\n RPM you just installed:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm --verify osg-ca-certs\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lack of any output means there were no problems. If you would like to see all the files for which there are no problems, you can do:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm --verify -v osg-ca-certs\n\n........    /etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n\n........    /etc/grid-security/certificates/0119347c.0\n\n\n........    /etc/grid-security/certificates/0119347c.namespaces\n\n\n........    /etc/grid-security/certificates/0119347c.signing_policy\n\n\n... etc ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach dot indicates a specific check that was made and passed. If someone had modified a file, you might see this:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm --verify osg-ca-certs\n\n..5....T    /etc/grid-security/certificates/ffc3d59b.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means the files MD5 checksum has changed (so the contents have changed) and the timestamp is different. The complete set of changes you might see (copied from the \nrpm\n man page) are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\nfile Size differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\nMode differs (includes permissions and file type)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nMD5 sum differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\nDevice major/minor number mismatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\nreadLink(2) path mismatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU\n\n\nUser ownership differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\nGroup ownership differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nmTime differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't care about some of those changes, you can tell rpm to ignore them. For instance, to ignore changes in the modification time:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm --verify --nomtime osg-ca-certs\n\n..5.....    /etc/grid-security/certificates/ffc3d59b.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding a package\n\n\nIf you want to know what package a file belongs to, you can ask rpm. For instance, if you're curious what package contains the \nsrm-ls\n command, you can do:\n\n\n#\n \n1\n. Find the exact path\n\nuser@host $\n which srm-ls\n\n/usr/bin/srm-ls\n\n\n\n#\n \n2\n. Ask rpm what package it is part of:\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -q --file /usr/bin/srm-ls\n\nbestman2-client-2.2.0-14.osg.el5.noarch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know what other things are in a package--perhaps the other available tools or configuration files--you can do that as well:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -ql bestman2-client\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc\n\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc.samples\n\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/srmclient.conf\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-copy\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-copy-status\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-extendfilelifetime\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-ls\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-ls-status\n\n\n... output trimmed ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat else does a package install?\n\n\nSometimes you need to understand what other software is installed by a package. This can be particularly useful for understanding \nmeta-packages\n, which are packages such as the \nosg-wn-client\n (worker node client) that contain nothing by themselves but only depend on other RPMs. To do this, use the \n--requires\n option to rpm. For example, you can see that the worker node client (as of OSG 3.1.8 in early September, 2012) will install \ncurl\n, \nuberftp\n, \nlcg-utils\n, and a dozen or so other packages.\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -q --requires osg-wn-client\n\n/usr/bin/curl  \n\n\n/usr/bin/dccp  \n\n\n/usr/bin/ldapsearch  \n\n\n/usr/bin/uberftp  \n\n\n/usr/bin/wget  \n\n\nbestman2-client  \n\n\nconfig(osg-wn-client) = 3.0.0-16.osg.el5\n\n\ndcache-srmclient  \n\n\ndcap-tunnel-gsi  \n\n\nedg-gridftp-client  \n\n\nfetch-crl  \n\n\nglite-fts-client  \n\n\nglobus-gass-copy-progs  \n\n\ngrid-certificates  \n\n\njava-1.6.0-sun-compat  \n\n\nlcg-utils  \n\n\nlfc-client  \n\n\nlfc-python  \n\n\nmyproxy  \n\n\nosg-system-profiler  \n\n\nosg-version  \n\n\nrpmlib(CompressedFileNames) \nlt;= 3.0.4-1\n\n\nrpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) \nlt;= 4.0-1\n\n\nvo-client\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding RPM Packages\n\n\nIt is normally best to read the OSG documentation to decide which packages to install because it may not be obvious what the correct packages to install are. That said, you can use yum to find out all sort of things. For instance, you can list packages that begin with \"voms\":\n\n\nuser@host $\n yum list \nvoms*\n\n\nLoaded plugins: kernel-module, priorities\n\n\n957 packages excluded due to repository priority protections\n\n\nAvailable Packages\n\n\nvoms.i386                                                    2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms.x86_64                                                  2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-admin-client.x86_64                                     2.0.16-1                                           osg \n\n\nvoms-admin-server.noarch                                     2.6.1-9                                            osg \n\n\nvoms-clients.x86_64                                          2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-compat.i386                                             1.9.19.2-6.osg                                     osg \n\n\nvoms-compat.x86_64                                           1.9.19.2-6.osg                                     osg \n\n\nvoms-devel.i386                                              2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-devel.x86_64                                            2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-doc.x86_64                                              2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-mysql-plugin.x86_64                                     3.1.5.1-1.el5                                      epel\n\n\nvoms-server.x86_64                                           2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvomsjapi.x86_64                                              2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvomsjapi-javadoc.x86_64                                      2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to search for packages that contain VOMS anywhere in the name or description, you can use \nyum search\n:\n\n\nuser@host $\n yum search voms\n\nLoaded plugins: kernel-module, priorities\n\n\n957 packages excluded due to repository priority protections\n\n\n================================================== Matched: voms ===================================================\n\n\nosg-voms.noarch : OSG VOMS\n\n\nperl-VOMS-Lite.noarch : Perl extension for VOMS Attribute certificate creation\n\n\nperl-voms-server.noarch : Perl extension for VOMS Attribute certificate creation\n\n\nphp-voms-admin.noarch : Web based interface to control VOMS parameters written in PHP\n\n\nvoms.i386 : Virtual Organization Membership Service\n\n\nvoms.x86_64 : Virtual Organization Membership Service\n\n\n... etc ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne last example, if you want to know what RPM would give you the \nvoms-proxy-init\n command, you can ask \nyum\n.

repository and \nno other\n repositories, you can tell yum to do that with the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum --disablerepo\n=\n* --enablerepo\n=\nosg update\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced topic: Getting debugging information for installed software\n\n\nIf you run into a problem with our software and have a hankering to debug it directly (or perhaps we need to ask you for some help), you can install so-called \"debuginfo\" packages. These packages will provide debugging symbols and source code so that you can do things like run \ngdb\n or \npstack\n to get information about a program.\n\n\nInstalling the debuginfo package requires three steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the installation of debuginfo packages. This only needs to be done once. Edit the yum repo file, usually \n/etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo\n to enable the separate debuginfo repository. Near the bottom of the file, you'll see the \nosg-debug\n repo: \n\n\n[osg-debug]\n\n\n\nname\n=\nOSG Software for Enterprise Linux 5 - $basearch - Debug\n\n\nbaseurl\n=\nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg-release/$basearch/debu\n\n\nfailovermethod\n=\npriority \n\n\npriority\n=\n98 \n\n\nenabled\n=\n1\n\n\ngpgcheck\n=\n1 \n\n\ngpgkey\n=\nfile:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-OSG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that \"enabled\" is set to 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure out which package installed the program you want to debug. One way to figure it out is to ask RPM. For example, if you want to debug grid-proxy-init:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -qf \n`\nwhich grid-proxy-init\n`\n\n\nglobus-proxy-utils-5.0-5.osg.x86_64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the debugging information for that package. Continuing this example: \n\n\nroot@host #\n debuginfo-install globus-proxy-utils\n\n...\n\n\n=================================================================================================================================\n\n\n Package                                      Arch                   Version                     Repository                 Size\n\n\n=================================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstalling:\n\n\n globus-proxy-utils-debuginfo                 x86_64                 5.0-5.osg                   osg-debug                  61 k\n\n\n\nTransaction Summary\n\n\n=================================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstall       1 Package(s)\n\n\nUpgrade       0 Package(s)\n\n\n\nTotal download size: 61 k\n\n\nIs this ok [y/N]: y\n\n\n...\n\n\nInstalled:\n\n\n  globus-proxy-utils-debuginfo.x86_64 0:5.0-5.osg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last step will select the right package name, then use \nyum\n to install it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nYum not finding packages\n\n\nIf you is not finding some packages, e.g.:\n\n\nError Downloading Packages:\n  packageXYZ: failure: packageXYZ.rpm from osg: [Errno 256] No more mirrors to try.\n\n\n\n\n\nthen you can try cleaning up Yum's cache: \n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerpeo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\nto make an even more thorough job you can follow also add:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean expire-cache --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nyum clean\n cleans only enabled repositories. If you want to also clean any (temporarily) disabled repositories you need to use \n--enablerepo=\u2019*\u2019\n option.\n\n\n\n\nYum complaining about missing keys\n\n\nIf yum is complaining you can re-import the keys in your distribution: \n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY*\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nThe main yum web site\n\n\nA good description of the commands for RPM and yum can be found at \nLearn Linux 101: RPM and YUM Package Management\n.",

Installing the debuginfo package requires three steps.    Enable the installation of debuginfo packages. This only needs to be done once. Edit the yum repo file, usually  /etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo  to enable the separate debuginfo repository.

            "text": "Installing, Configuring, Using, and Troubleshooting RSV\n\n\nAbout This Guide\n\n\nThe Resource and Service Validation (RSV) software helps a site administrator verify that certain site resources and services are working as expected. OSG recommends that sites install and run RSV, but it is optional; further, each site selects which specific tests (called \nprobes\n) to run.\n\n\nUse this page to learn more about RSV in general, and how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot RSV from the OSG software repositories. For documentation on specific probes or on how to write your own probes, please check the \nReference section\n.\n\n\nIntroduction to RSV\n\n\nThe Resource and Service Validation (RSV) software provides OSG site administrators a scalable and easy-to-maintain\nresource and service monitoring infrastructure.\nIt consists of client tools that allow a site administrator to run tests against their site by providing a set of tests\n(which can run on the same or other hosts within a site), HTCondor-Cron for scheduling, and tools for collecting and\nstoring the results (using Gratia).\nThe client package is not installed by default and may be installed on a CE or other host.\nGenerally, you configure the RSV client to run tests at scheduled time intervals and then it makes results available on\na local website. Also, the client can upload test results to a central collector (see next item).\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user IDs \nrsv\n and \ncndrcron\n\n\nService certificate:\n The RSV service requires a service certificate (\n/etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvcert.pem\n) and matching key (\n/etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvkey.pem\n)\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n To view results, port 80 must accept incoming requests; outbound connectivity to tested services must work, too\n\n\nHost choice:\n Install RSV on your site CE unless you have specific reasons (e.g., performance) for installing on a separate host\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the RSV host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling RSV\n\n\nAn installation of RSV at a site consists of the RSV client software, the Apache web server, parts of HTCondor (for its cron-like scheduling capabilities), and various other small tools. To simplify installation, OSG provides a convenience RPM that installs all required software with a single command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider updating your local cache of Yum repository data and your existing RPM packages:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n\\*\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \nupdate\n command will update \nall\n packages on your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have installed HTCondor already but not by RPM, install a special empty RPM to make RSV happy:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install empty-condor --enablerepo\n=\nosg-empty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall RSV and related software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install rsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring RSV\n\n\nAfter installation, there are some one-time configuration steps to tell RSV how to operate at your site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and follow the instructions in the file. There are detailed comments for each setting. In the simplest case \u2014 to monitor only your CE \u2014 set the \nhtcondor_ce_hosts\n variable to the fully qualified hostname of your CE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have installed HTCondor already but not by RPM, specify the location of the Condor installation in \n30-rsv.ini\n in the \ncondor_location\n setting. If an HTCondor RPM is installed, you do not need to set \ncondor_location\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete the configuration using the \nosg-configure\n tool:\n\n\nroot@host #\n osg-configure -v\n\nroot@host #\n osg-configure -c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional configuration\n\n\nThe following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be required for setting up a small or typical site. If you do not need any of the following special configurations, skip to \nthe section on using RSV\n.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, read the \nConfigureRsv\n page for more advanced configuration options.\n\n\nConfiguring RSV to run probes using a remote server\n\n\nRSV monitors systems by running probes, which can run on the RSV host itself (the default case), via a separate batch system like HTCondor, or via a remote batch system using a Globus gatekeeper and its job manager. The last two options both can count those jobs and report them to, for example, Gratia.\n\n\nIn this case, remember to:\n\n\n\n\nAdd the RSV user \nrsv\n on all the systems where the probes may run, and\n\n\nMap the RSV service certificate to the user you intend to use for RSV. This should be a local user used exclusively for RSV and not belonging to an institutional VO to avoid for the RSV probes to be accounted as regular VO jobs in Gratia. \nThis can be done in the configuration of the \nLCMAPS VOMS plugin\n on your CE.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the RSV web server to use HTTPS instead of HTTP\n\n\nIf you would like your local RSV web server to use HTTPS instead of the default HTTP (for compatibility or security reasons), complete the steps below.

However, you can run RSV probes manually at any time:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rsv-control --run --all-enabled\n\n\n\n\n\nIf successful, results will be available from your local RSV web server (e.g., \nhttp://localhost/rsv\n) and, if enabled (which is the default) on \nMyOSG\n.\n\n\nYou can also run the metrics individually or pass special parameters as explained in the \nrsv-control document\n.\n\n\nTroubleshooting RSV\n\n\nTo get assistance, use the \nhelp procedure\n.\n\n\nRSV has a tool to collect information useful for troubleshooting into a tarball that can be shared with the developers and support staff.\nTo use it:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --profile\n\nRunning the rsv-profiler...\n\n\nOSG-RSV Profiler\n\n\nAnalyzing...\n\n\nMaking tarball (rsv-profiler.tar.gz)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find more information on troubleshooting RSV in the \nrsv-control documentation\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are getting assistance via the trouble ticket system, you must add a \n.txt\n extension to the tarball so it can be uploaded:\n\n\n\n\nFailed to send via Gratia\n\n\nIf you see \nFailed to send record Failed to send via Gratia: Server unable to receive data:\n in \n/var/log/rsv/consumers/gratia-consumer.output\n you should process to disable the gratia consumer using the following commands\n\n\nroot@host#\n  rsv-control --disable --host \nYOUR RSV HOST\n gratia-consumer\n\nroot@host#\n  rsv-control --off --host \nYOUR RSV HOST\n gratia-consumer\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant file locations\n\n\nLogs and configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric log files\n\n\n/var/log/rsv/metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer log files\n\n\n/var/log/rsv/consumers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML files\n\n\n/usr/share/rsv/www/\n\n\nAvailable at \nhttp://your.host.example.com/rsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial configuration\n\n\n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n\n\nRead by \nosg-configure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSV configuration\n\n\n/etc/rsv\n\n\nGenerally files in this directory should not be edited directly.

Use the \n--verbose\n (\n-v\n) flag. This flag can be used with any of rsv-control's abilities (run, enable, list, etc). The verbosity levels are:\n\n\n\n\n0 = print nothing\n\n\n1 = print warnings and errors along with usual output of command being run (1 is the default level)\n\n\n2 = adds informational messages\n\n\n3 = full debugging output\n\n\n\n\nFor example, here is the output when running a metric with -v2.\n\n\n\n  \nShow detailed ouput\n\n\n\u0002wzxhzdk:3\u0003\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nTo get assistance, please use \nthis page\n and attach the output of \nrsv-control --profile\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rsv-control --profile\n\nRunning the rsv-profiler...\n\n\nOSG-RSV Profiler\n\n\nAnalyzing...\n\n\nMaking tarball (rsv-profiler.tar.gz)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nThe RSV installation will create two users unless they are already created.

This document provides instructions for configuration beyond what osg-configure is able to do.\n\n\nConfiguring metrics\n\n\nIf you need to change the behavior of a metric you can edit the metric configuration files. These replace the spec files from previous versions of RSV.\n\n\n\n\n/etc/rsv/metrics\n - changes made to conf file in this directory named after a metric will affect the metric when run against all hosts\n\n\n/etc/rsv/metrics/\nHOST\n - changes made to conf files in this directory (named as the host FQDN) will affect the metric when run against the specific host\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration files are in INI format and have two sections:\n\n\n\n\na first one named after the metric with execution options\n\n\na second one with the name including the \"args\" keyword, including parameters sent to the probe at invokation\n\n\n\n\nChanging the times a metric runs\n\n\nTo change the time a metric runs set the \ncron-interval\n setting in the metric's conf file. Use \nman 5 crontab\n for a description of the format. For example, to change the \norg.osg.general.ping-host\n to run at a different time:\n\n\n[org.osg.general.ping-host]\n\n\ncron-interval\n \n=\n \n45 * * * *\n\n\n\n[org.osg.general.ping-host args]\n\n\n#ping-count =\n\n\n#ping-timeout =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBe sure to put the \ncron-interval\n setting in the \n[org.osg.general.ping-host]\n section, and not the \n[org.osg.general.ping-host args]\n section! The purpose of the \"args\" section is described in the \"passing extra parameters to a metric\" section below.\n\n\n\n\nAfter modifying the cron time of a metric you must restart RSV for the change to take effect.\n\n\nTo see what times each of the metrics is running you can use \nrsv-control\n as follows:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control -l --cron-times\n\n\nMetrics enabled for host: osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu:10443 | Cron times\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------+--------------------\n\n\norg.osg.srm.srmcp-readwrite                         | 28 * * * *\n\n\norg.osg.srm.srmping                                 | 13,33,53 * * * *\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing extra parameters to a metric\n\n\nAny \nkey=value\n pairs in the \"args\" section of the metric's \nconf\n file will be turned into command line parameters to the probe. For example, for this file:\n\n\n[org.osg.certificates.cacert-expiry args]\n\n\nwarning-hours\n \n=\n \n6\n\n\nerror-hours\n \n=\n \n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would lead to the probe getting called with the command-line parameters \n--warning-hours 6 --error-hours 12\n.\n\n\nConfigure consumers\n\n\nThere is a configuration file common to all consumers: \n/etc/rsv/consumers.conf\n. It is a file in INI format and possible entries are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nValues\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenabled\n\n\nconsumers\n\n\nComma-separated list of consumers to be enabled\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\n\n\nlocal\n\n\nIf this is set to local, a record with a local timestamp will be supplied to the consumer. If this is set to any other value, or is not set, a record with the GMT will be created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach consumer has a configuration file in \n/etc/rsv/consumers\n named after it. This allows to specify command lines and environment for the consumers. Some consumers may have also their own configuration file, usually in \n/etc/rsv/\n. Below is an example for the Nagios consumer.\n\n\nSending RSV records to Nagios\n\n\n\n\nEdit your \n/etc/rsv/rsv-nagios.conf\n file and fill in the appropriate information. The path of the configuration file is specified in \n/etc/rsv/consumers/nagios-consumer.conf\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf your Nagios config file contains password information you will want to lock down the permissions. Here is a suggested way to do this (replace \nrsvuser\n with the group of your RSV user (\nrsvuser\n by default)):\n\n\nroot@host#\n chown root:\nrsvuser\n /etc/rsv/rsv-nagios.conf\n\nroot@host#\n chmod \n0440\n /etc/rsv/rsv-nagios.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the configuration file at \n/etc/rsv/consumers/nagios-consumer.conf\n, check the following two settings:\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the path to your config file is correct. It may be referencing a directory \nconfig\n instead of \netc\n\n\nIf you want to use \nrsv2nsca\n add the string \"--send-nsca\" to the \nargs\n line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable and start the Nagios consumer by editing \nconsumers.conf\n or by using \nrsv-control\n as follows:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --enable nagios-consumer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nagios consumer will be started the next time that you start RSV. If you are already running RSV you can turn on the Nagios consumer immediately by running:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --on nagios-consumer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo verify that the Nagios consumer is running you can run \nrsv-control -j\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe log information for the Nagios consumer can be found in these files:\n\n\n/var/log/rsv/consumers/nagios-consumer.log\n\n\n/var/log/rsv/consumers/nagios-consumer.out\n\n\n/var/log/rsv/consumers/nagios-consumer.err\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral RSV configuration options\n\n\nYou can configure the RSV framework using \n/etc/rsv/rsv.conf\n.

If set to 0 no trimming will occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njob-timeout\n\n\ninteger\n\n\nTime in seconds before a metric is killed.

It details the usage of the \nrsv-control\n command for enabling, disabling, testing and running RSV probes.\n\n\nrsv-control\n provides an interface to many RSV tasks. \nrsv-control\n can view RSV jobs, run metrics, enable or disable metrics and consumers, and allow advanced configuration.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nrsv-control\n can be used to configure RSV as described here and in \nthe advanced configuration document\n. Most site admins will be able to configure RSV by editing \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and running \nosg-configure\n as described in the \ninstallation doc\n.\n\n\n\n\nUsing \nrsv-control\n to configure is for advanced RSV use including enabling non-default metrics. Admins who don't use \nrsv-control\n for configuration can still use it to view their RSV jobs, run RSV tests, and help debug RSV problems. Anyone can view the jobs, but you must be root or the RSV user (\nrsv\n by default) to execute other commands, e.g. run, enable and disable probes, or to turn RSV on and off.\n\n\nViewing RSV jobs\n\n\nrsv-control provides two different views: viewing the \ndesired\n state and viewing the current \nactual\n state.\n\n\n\n\nDesired = what metrics and consumers will start the next time RSV is started\n\n\nActual = what metrics and consumers are currently running\n\n\n\n\nDesired state\n\n\nTo view the desired state, use the \n--list\n (\n-l\n for short) flag.

Note that \"enable\" and \"disable\" are desired states (this is similar to \nosg-control\n). After enabling a metric you should turn it on if you want it to be running immediately. After disabling a metric that is running, you should still turn it off (a message will print after each of these actions to remind you of this behavior).\n\n\nEnabling\n\n\nThe syntax for enabling metrics looks similar to the syntax for running metrics:\n\n\nrsv-control --enable --host \nHOST\n \nMETRIC\n [ \nMETRIC2\n ...]\n\n\nYou must provide a host to enable the metric against (in order to enable a metric on multiple hosts you must run \nrsv-control\n once per host).\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --enable \n\\\n\n    --host osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu org.osg.gip.consistency\n\nEnabling metric \norg.osg.gip.consistency\n for host \nosg-edu.cs.wisc.edu\n\n\n\nOne or more metrics have been enabled and will be started the next time RSV is started.

Use the \n--verbose\n (\n-v\n) flag. This flag can be used with any of rsv-control's abilities (run, enable, list, etc). The verbosity levels are:\n\n\n\n\n0 = print nothing\n\n\n1 = print warnings and errors along with usual output of command being run (1 is the default level)\n\n\n2 = adds informational messages\n\n\n3 = full debugging output\n\n\n\n\nUsing the RSV verify tool\n\n\nThe \n--verify\n flag will run some basic checks for your RSV installation:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --verify\n\nTesting if Condor-Cron is running...\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\nTesting if metrics are running...\n\n\nOK (98 running metrics)\n\n\n\nTesting if consumers are running...\n\n\nOK (1 running consumers)\n\n\n\nChecking which consumers are configured...\n\n\nThe following consumers are enabled: html-consumer\n\n\nWARNING: The gratia-consumer is not enabled.

Warning  rsv-control  can be used to configure RSV as described here and in  the advanced configuration document . Most site admins will be able to configure RSV by editing  /etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini  and running  osg-configure  as described in the  installation doc .   Using  rsv-control  to configure is for advanced RSV use including enabling non-default metrics. Admins who don't use  rsv-control  for configuration can still use it to view their RSV jobs, run RSV tests, and help debug RSV problems. Anyone can view the jobs, but you must be root or the RSV user ( rsv  by default) to execute other commands, e.g. run, enable and disable probes, or to turn RSV on and off.",

It is particularly useful when setting up a VO for the first time or when changing the sites at which a VO\u2019s jobs can run. For a site to pass the test, it must successfully run a simple test job via the normal GlideinWMS mechanisms, in much the same way as a real VO job.\n\n\nUse this page to learn how to install, configure, and use the Tester for your VO front-end.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nSoftware:\n You must have \na GlideinWMS Front-end\n installed\n\n\nConfiguration:\n The GlideinWMS Front-end must be configured (a) \nto have at least one group that matches pilots to sites using DESIRED_SITES\n, and (b) \nto support the is_itb user job attribute\n\n\nHost choice:\n The Tester should be installed on its own host; a small Virtual Machine (VM) is ideal\n\n\nService certificate:\n The Tester requires a host certificate at \n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n and an accompanying key at \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n Test jobs must be able to contact the tester using the HTCondor Shared Port on port 9615 (TCP), and you must be able to contact a web server on port 80 (TCP) to view test results.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the Tester\n\n\nThe Tester software takes advantage of several other OSG software components, so the installation will also include OSG\u2019s site validation system (RSV), HTCondor, and the GlideinWMS pilot submission software.\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install rsv-gwms-tester\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Tester\n\n\nBefore you use the Tester, there are some one-time configuration steps to complete, one set on your GlideinWMS Front-end Central Manager host and one set on the Tester host.\n\n\nConfiguring the GlideinWMS Front-end Central Manager\n\n\nComplete these steps \non your GlideinWMS Front-end Central Manager host\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorize the Tester host to connect to your Central Manager:\n\n\nroot@host #\n glidecondor_addDN -allow-others -daemon \nlt\n;\nCOMMENT\ngt\n;\n \nlt\n;\nTESTER_DN\ngt\n;\n condor\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nCOMMENT\n is a human-readable label for the Tester host (e.g., \u201cRSV GWMS Tester at myhost\u201d), and \nTESTER_DN\n is the Distinguished Name (DN) of the host certificate of your Tester host. Most likely, you will need to quote both of these values to protect them from the shell. For example:\n\n\nroot@host #\n glidecondor_addDN -allow-others -daemon \nRSV GWMS Tester on Fermicloud\n \n/DC=com/DC=DigiCert-Grid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=fermicloud357.fnal.gov\n condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart HTCondor to apply the changes\n\n\nOn \nEL\u00a06\n systems:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service condor restart\n\n\n\n\n\nOn \nEL\u00a07\n systems:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl restart condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the new Tester to your GlideinWMS front-end configuration.\n   Edit the file \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n and add a line as follows within the \nschedds\n element\n\n\nlt;schedd DN=\nlt;TESTER_DN\ngt;\n fullname=\nlt;TESTER_HOSTNAME\ngt;\ngt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nTESTER_DN\n is the Distinguished Name (DN) of the host certificate of your Tester host (as above), and \nTESTER_HOSTNAME\n is the fully qualified hostname of the Tester host.

The \nconstraint\n line is an HTCondor ClassAd expression containing one \nstringListMember\n function per VO that your Front-end supports. If there is more than one VO, the function invocations are joined by the \u201clogical or\u201d operator, \n||\n. Edit the \nconstraint\n line for your Front-end.\n\n\nFor example, for a single VO named \nFoo\n, the line would be:\n\n\nconstraint = stringListMember(\nFoo\n, GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor two VOs named \nFoo\n and \nBar\n, the line would be:\n\n\nconstraint = stringListMember(\nFoo\n, GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs) || stringListMember(\nBar\n, GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not change the other settings in this file, unless you have clear and specific reasons to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorize the central manager of your Front-end to connect to the tester host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n glidecondor_addDN -allow-others -daemon \nlt\n;\nCOMMENT\ngt\n;\n \nlt\n;\nCENTRAL_MGR\ngt\n;\n condor\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nCOMMENT\n is a human-readable identifier for the Central Manager, and \nCENTRAL_MGR\n is the Distinguished Name (DN) of the host certificate of your GlideinWMS Front-end\u2019s Central Manager host.

There may be transient failures but if you notice a site in the failed state over multiple days, contact OSG Factory Operations (\n) about the failing site, including a link to your Tester RSV results page.\n\n\nTo see detailed information from each probe, click on the probe name in the Metric column.\n\n\nTo see the list of sites that are supported by your VO(s) and are being tested, click the \u201corg.osg.local-gfactory-site-querying-local\u201d link at the bottom of the list of probes. You can also run the probe manually, as described next.\n\n\nListing supported sites manually\n\n\nTo manually run the probe that fetches the list of sites supported by your VO(s), run the following command on your Tester host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rsv-control --run org.osg.local-gfactory-site-querying-local --host localhost\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probe produces many lines of output, some of which are just about the probe execution itself. But look for lines like this:\n\n\nMSG: Updating configuration for host \nUCSD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highlighted name is the site name, and there should be one such line per site supported by your VO(s).\n\n\nTroubleshooting RSV-GWMS-Tester\n\n\nYou can find more information on troubleshooting in the \nRSV troubleshooting section\n\n\nLogs and configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondor Cron log files\n\n\n/var/log/condor-cron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric configuration\n\n\n/etc/rsv/metrics/org.osg.local-gfactory-site-querying-local.conf\n\n\nTo change arguments and environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nTo get assistance, please use the \nthis page\n.\n\n\nReference\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\n\nUser that owns certificate\n\n\nPath to certificate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost certificate\n\n\nroot\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost key\n\n\nroot\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind instructions to request a host certificate \nhere\n.",
