If you are not a site adminstrator...\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a researcher interested in using OSG resources, you can find user documentation \nhere\n. \n\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about the OSG and our mission, visit our website \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nThis document outlines the overall installation process for an OSG site and provides many links into detailed installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and similar pages. If you do not see software-related technical documentation listed here, try the search bar to the left or contacting us at \nhelp@opensciencegrid.org\n.\n\n\nPlan the Site\n\n\nIf you have not done so already, \nplan the overall architecture of your OSG site\n. It is recommended that your plan be sufficiently detailed to include the OSG hosts that are needed and the main software components for each host. Be sure to consider \nthe operating systems that OSG supports\n. For example, a basic site might include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nHost\n\n\nMajor Software\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute Element (CE)\n\n\nosg-ce.example.edu\n\n\nOSG CE, HTCondor Central Manager, etc. (\nosg-ce-condor\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorker Nodes\n\n\nwNNN.cluster.example.edu\n\n\nOSG worker node client (\nosg-wn-client\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the Batch System\n\n\nThe assumption is that you have an existing batch system at your site. Currently, we support \nHTCondor\n, \nLSF\n, \nPBS\n and \nTORQUE\n, \nSGE\n, and \nSlurm\n batch systems.\n\n\nFor smaller sites (less than 50 worker nodes), the most common way to add a site to OSG is to install the OSG Compute Element (CE) on the central host of your batch system.  At such a site - especially if you have minimal time to maintain a CE - you may want to contact \n to ask about using an OSG-hosted CE instead of running your own.  Before proceeding with an install, be sure that you can submit and successfully run a job from your OSG CE host into your batch system.\n\n\nAdd OSG Software\n\n\nIf necessary, provision all OSG hosts that are in your site plan and that do not exist yet.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor sites with more than a handful of worker nodes, it is recommended to use some sort of configuration management tool to install, configure, and maintain your site. While beyond the scope of OSG\u2019s documentation to explain how to select and use such a system, some popular configuration management tools are \nPuppet\n, \nChef\n, \nAnsible\n, and \nCFEngine\n.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Installation Instructions\n\n\n\n\nSecurity information for OSG signed RPMs\n\n\nUsing Yum and RPM\n\n\nInstall the OSG repositories\n\n\nOSG Software release series\n - look here to upgrade from OSG 3.1 to OSG 3.2 or from OSG 3.2 to OSG 3.3\n\n\nInstallation best practices\n\n\n\n\nInstalling and Managing Certificates for Site Security\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the grid certificate authorities (CAs)\n\n\nHow do I get PKI host and service X.509 certificates?\n\n\nAutomatically updating the grid certificate authorities (CAs)\n\n\nOSG PKI command line client reference\n\n\n\n\nAdding OSG Software to Worker Nodes\n\n\n\n\nWorker Node (WN) Client Overview\n\n\nInstall the WN client software on every worker node \u2013 pick a method:\n\n\nUsing RPMs\n \u2013 useful when managing your worker nodes with a tool (e.g., Puppet, Chef)\n\n\nUsing a tarball\n \u2013 useful for installation onto a shared filesystem (does not require root access)\n\n\nUsing OASIS\n \u2013 useful when \nCVMFS\n is already mounted on your worker nodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(optional) \nInstall the CernVM-FS client\n to make it easy for user jobs to use needed software from OSG's OASIS repositories\n\n\n(optional) \nInstall singularity on the OSG worker node\n, to allow pilot jobs to isolate user jobs.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling and Configuring the Compute Element\n\n\n\n\nInstall the compute element (HTCondor-CE and other software):\n\n\nOverview and architecture\n\n\nInstall HTCondor-CE\n\n\nConfigure the HTCondor-CE job router\n, including common recipes\n\n\nTroubleshooting HTCondor-CE installations\n\n\nSubmitting jobs to HTCondor-CE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-configure\n Reference\n\n\n\n\nInstalling and Configuring Other Nodes\n\n\nAll of these node types and their services are optional, although OSG requires the Frontier Squid caching service if you have installed \nCVMFS\n on your worker nodes.\n\n\n\n\nInstall Frontier Squid, the HTTP caching proxy service\n\n\nRSV monitoring to monitor and report to OSG on the health of your site\n\n\nInstall RSV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the GlideinWMS VO Frontend\n if your want your users\u2019 jobs to run on the OSG\n\n\nInstall the RSV GlideinWMS Tester\n if you want to test your front-end's ability to submit jobs to sites in the OSG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStorage element (pick one):\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nInstall standalone OSG GridFTP\n: GridFTP server\n\n\n(optional) \nInstall load-balanced OSG GridFTP\n: when a single GridFTP server isn't enough\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeStMan\n\n\nInstall Bestman on POSIX\n: BeStMan2 SRM server + GridFTP server\n\n\nInstall Bestman on Hadoop\n: BeStMan2 SRM and GridFTP servers on the Hadoop Distributed File System\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)\n\n\nHadoop Overview\n: HDFS information, planning, and guides\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRootD\n\n\nXRootd Overview\n: XRootD information, planning, and guides\n\n\nInstall Xrootd Server\n: XRootD redirector installation\n\n\nInstall BeStMan-Gateway XRootD\n: BeStMan2 SRM server + GridFTP server + XRootD fuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest OSG Software\n\n\nAt very least, it is vital to test \nmanual\n submission of jobs from inside and outside of your site through your CE to your batch system.

These individual services will be accessed by virtual\norganizations (VOs), which will delegate the resources to scientists, researchers, and students.\n\n\nSharing\n is a fundamental principle for the OSG: your site is encouraged to support as many OSG-registered VOs as\nlocal conditions allow.  \nAutonomy\n is another principle: you are not required to support any you do not want.\n\n\nAs the administrator responsible for deployment of the OSG software stack, your task is to make your existing computing\nand storage resources available to and reliable for your supported VOs.

Even a compute element is not strictly\nnecessary: OSG offers a \"hosted CE\" service where OSG will run the software provided only with a SSH connection to the\nbatch submit host.  Contact \n for more information on the hosted CE.\n\n\n\n\nThe simplest way to support OSG is to only provide SSH logins for the hosted CE and install the worker node\n  environment.\n\n\nLarger or more complex sites will elect to run their own CE in addition to the WN environment and the simplest\n  data service (HTTP proxy cache).\n\n\nThe largest sites will additionally run large-scale data services such as a \"storage element\".  This is often required\n  for sites that want to support more complex organizations such as ATLAS or CMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAn essential concept on the OSG is the \"pilot job\".  The pilot, which arrives at your batch system, is sent by the\nVO and gets a resource allocation.  However, it \ndoes not\n contain any scientific payload.  Once started, it will\nconnect back to a resource pool and pull down individuals' scientific \"payload jobs\".  Hence, we do not think about\nsubmitting \"jobs\" to sites but rather \"resource requests\".\n\n\n\n\nSite Policies\n\n\nSites are encouraged to clearly specify and communicate their local policies regarding resource access. One common\nmechanism to do this is post them on a web page and make this page part of your site registration in\n\nMyOSG\n.  Written policies help external entities understand what your site wants to\naccomplish with the OSG -- and are often internally clarifying.\n\n\nIn line of our principle of \nsharing\n, we encourage you to allow virtual organizations registered with the OSG\n\"opportunistic use\" of your resources. You may need to preempt those jobs when higher priority jobs come around.\nThe end-users using the OSG generally prefer having access to your site subject to preemption over having no access\nat all.\n\n\nCompute Element\n\n\nA \nCompute Element\n allows VOs to access the resources at your site via external submission to a batch system.  To\nprovide this service, the OSG provides a vertically-integrated set of software centered around the \"HTCondor-CE\".\n\n\nAs part of the CE deploy, you must make a few site design choices:\n\n\n\n\nHost operating system: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or 7 are supported, as well as derivative distributions (CentOS,\n  ScientificLinux),\n\n\nThe batch system:  HTCondor, PBS, LSF, SGE, and Slurm are presently supported.  About 70% of OSG sites select\n  HTCondor.  Non-HTCondor sites will need a shared filesystem between the CE and worker nodes that is \nwritable by\n  root\n from the CE.\n\n\nThe network architecture of your cluster: Most VOs require unrestricted outbound network access from the worker nodes;\n  this is typically done through a NAT.  For sites where this is difficult to provide, some VOs are be able to provide\n  a whitelist of IP addresses they will need outbound access to; contact \n for support.\n\n\n\n\nThe CE will map each VO to one Unix user accont at the site (due to historic concerns, a handful may map to 2-3\naccounts).  Except in the case of HTCondor, the CE and the worker nodes need to have uniform username-to-UID mappings.\n\n\nIn addition to the basic remote submission service, the CE providers accounting and monitoring services, which will\nrun by default when the CE is enabled and started. The OSG central accounting system, GRACC, recieves individual\nrecords for each job run by the OSG on your CE. Aggregated summaries of this information can be viewed via the\n\nGRACC\n web interface.\n\n\nWorker Node Client\n\n\nThe Worker Node Client is software installed on each worker node to provide a minimal runtime environment for pilot\njobs.  We strive to keep this as lightweight as possible; it includes basic grid utilities, not scientific libraries.\n\n\nThere is a wide range of worker node management practices; accordingly, we provide the worker node client in three\nforms:\n\n\n\n\nRPM packaging\n: Grid utilities are deployed at the system level using \nyum\n.\n\n\nTarball installation\n: Utilities are deployed onto a sitewide shared\n  filesystem by unpacking a tarball and running a configuration script.\n\n\nCVMFS\n: CVMFS, a heavily-used global read-only filesystem, provides a copy of the grid utilities.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, OSG packages a global read-only filesystem called \nCVMFS\n for distribution of\nsoftware and data.  Many VOs either completely rely on CVMFS for software (LIGO, CMS, ATLAS) or rely on CVMFS for a\nmajority of jobs (OSG VO).  Some jobs can utilize worker nodes without CVMFS.  You will be able to share your\nresources regardless, but installing CVMFS is a primary mechanism to attract more jobs.\n\n\nData Service\n\n\nThere are two types of data services on the OSG:\n\n\n\n\nA \ncache\n pulls in data on read-demand, keeping it locally for further use.  We provide support for the\n  \nSquid HTTP\n cache for smaller working set sizes and software called \nXrootd\n\n  for larger datasets.  Almost every site on the OSG installs a Squid cache.\n\n\nA \nStorage Element\n provides remote, POSIX-like access to your site storage service for reading and writing of data.\n  All Storage Element implementations in the OSG support the GridFTP, Xrootd, and HTTPs protocols.\n\n\n\n\nThe storage element model is chosen mostly by sites that support either ATLAS or CMS VOs; otherwise, only caches are\ntypically provided.  Sites that need a SE which have existing POSIX-like storage (e.g., Lustre, GPFS) layer remote\naccess services (such as \nGridFTP\n) on top of the existing storage.  For sites wanting petascale storage -\nbut without an existing install - we provide support for \nHDFS\n and\n\nXrootd\n.",

At the heart of the CE is the \njob gateway\n software, which is responsible for handling incoming jobs, authorizing them, and delegating them to your batch system for execution. Historically, the OSG only had one option for a job gateway solution, Globus Toolkit\u2019s GRAM-based gatekeeper, but now offers the HTCondor-CE as an alternative.\n\n\nToday in OSG, most jobs that arrive at a CE (called \ngrid jobs\n) are \nnot\n end-user jobs, but rather pilot jobs submitted from factories. Successful pilot jobs create and make available an environment for actual end-user jobs to match and ultimately run within the pilot job container. Eventually pilot jobs remove themselves, typically after a period of inactivity.\n\n\nWhat is HTCondor-CE?\n\n\nHTCondor-CE is a special configuration of the HTCondor software designed to be a job gateway solution for the OSG. It is configured to use the \nJobRouter daemon\n to delegate jobs by transforming and submitting them to the site\u2019s batch system.\n\n\nHow is HTCondor-CE different from a GRAM CE?\n\n\nThe biggest difference you will see between an HTCondor-CE and a GRAM CE is in the way that jobs are submitted to your batch system; HTCondor-CE uses the built-in JobRouter daemon whereas GRAM CE uses jobmanager scripts written in Perl. Customizing your site\u2019s CE now requires editing configuration files instead of editing jobmanager scripts.\n\n\nListed below are some other benefits to switching to HTCondor-CE:\n\n\n\n\nScalability:\n HTCondor-CE is capable of supporting job workloads of large sites (see \nscale testing results\n)\n\n\nDebugging tools:\n HTCondor-CE offers \nmany tools to help troubleshoot\n issues with jobs\n\n\nRouting as configuration:\n HTCondor-CE\u2019s mechanism to transform and submit jobs is customized via configuration variables, which means that customizations will persist across upgrades and will not involve modification of software internals to route jobs\n\n\n\n\nHow Jobs Run\n\n\nOnce an incoming grid job is authorized, it is placed into HTCondor-CE\u2019s scheduler where the JobRouter creates a transformed copy (called the \nrouted job\n) and submits the copy to the batch system (called the \nbatch system job\n). After submission, HTCondor-CE monitors the batch system job and communicates its status to the original grid job, which in turn notifies the original submitter (e.g., job factory) of any updates. When the job completes, files are transferred along the same chain: from the batch system to the CE, then from the CE to the original submitter.\n\n\nOn HTCondor batch systems\n\n\nFor a site with an HTCondor \nbatch system\n, the JobRouter can use HTCondor protocols to place a transformed copy of the grid job directly into the batch system\u2019s scheduler, meaning that the routed and batch system jobs are one and the same. Thus, there are three representations of your job, each with its own ID (see diagram below):\n\n\n\n\nSubmit host: the HTCondor job ID in the original queue\n\n\nHTCondor-CE: the grid job\u2019s ID\n\n\nHTCondor batch system: the routed job\u2019s ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an HTCondor-CE/HTCondor setup, files are transferred from HTCondor-CE\u2019s spool directory to the batch system\u2019s spool directory using internal HTCondor protocols.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe JobRouter copies the job directly into the batch system and does not make use of \ncondor_submit\n. This means that if the HTCondor batch system is configured to add attributes to incoming jobs when they are submitted (i.e., \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n), these attributes will not be added to the routed jobs.\n\n\n\n\nOn other batch systems\n\n\nFor non-HTCondor batch systems, the JobRouter transforms the grid job into a routed job on the CE and the routed job submits a job into the batch system via a process called the BLAHP. Thus, there are four representations of your job, each with its own ID (see diagram below):\n\n\n\n\nSubmit host: the HTCondor job ID in the original queue\n\n\nHTCondor-CE: the grid job\u2019s ID and the routed job\u2019s ID\n\n\nHTCondor batch system: the batch system\u2019s job ID\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the following figure specifies the PBS case, it applies to all non-HTCondor batch systems:\n\n\n\n\nWith non-HTCondor batch systems, HTCondor-CE cannot use internal HTCondor protocols to transfer files so its spool directory must be exported to a shared file system that is mounted on the batch system\u2019s worker nodes.\n\n\nOver SSH\n\n\nHTCondor-CE-Bosco is a special configuration of HTCondor-CE that can submit jobs to a remote cluster over SSH. The HTCondor-CE-Bosco provides a simple starting point for opportunistic resource owners that want to start contributing to the OSG with minimal effort: an organization will be able to accept OSG jobs by allowing SSH access to a submit node in their cluster.\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE-Bosco is intended for small sites or as an introduction to the OSG. If your site intends to run thousands of OSG jobs, you will need to host a standard \nHTCondor-CE\n because HTCondor-CE-Bosco has not yet been optimized for such loads.\n\n\nHow the CE is Customized\n\n\nAside from the \nbasic configuration\n required in the CE installation, there are two main ways to customize your CE (if you decide any customization is required at all):\n\n\n\n\nDeciding which VOs are allowed to run at your site:\n The method of limiting the VOs that are allowed to run on your site has not changed between GRAM and HTCondor-CE\u2019s: select an authorization system, GUMS or edg-mkgridmap, and configure it accordingly.\n\n\nHow to filter and transform the grid jobs to be run on your batch system:\n Filtering and transforming grid jobs (i.e., setting site-specific attributes or resource limits), requires configuration of your site\u2019s job routes. For examples of common job routes, consult the \nJobRouter recipes\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are running HTCondor as your batch system, you will have two HTCondor configurations side-by-side (one residing in \n/etc/condor/\n and the other in \n/etc/condor-ce\n) and will need to make sure to differentiate the two when editing any configuration.\n\n\n\n\nHow Security Works\n\n\nIn the OSG, security depends on a PKI infrastructure involving Certificate Authorities (CAs) where CAs sign and issue certifcates to users and hosts. When these users and hosts wish to communicate with each other, the identities of each party is confirmed by cross-checking their certificates with the signing CA and establishing trust.\n\n\nDue to the OSG's distributed nature, a user's job may end up at any number of sites, potentially needing to re-authenticate at multiple points. Instead of sending the user's certificate with the job for this re-authentication, trust can be delegated to a proxy that is generated from the user certificate, which is then attached to the job and expires after some set time for added security.\n\n\nIn its default configuration, HTCondor-CE uses GSI-based authentication and authorization (the same as Globus GRAM) to verify the certificate chain, which will work with existing GUMS servers or grid mapfiles. Additionally, it can be reconfigured to provide alternate authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos, SSL, shared secret, or even IP-based authentication. More information about authorization methods can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nNext steps\n\n\nIf you're transitioning from a GRAM CE to HTCondor-CE, the process is the same as if you were setting up a completely new CE, whether you're installing it on a new machine or alongside your GRAM CE.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up \njob routes\n\n\nSubmitting\n jobs to HTCondor-CE\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n HTCondor-CE\n\n\nRegister the CE with OIM\n\n\nRegister with the OSG GlideinWMS factories and/or the ATLAS AutoPyFactory",

For more advanced configuration, see the section on \noptional configurations\n.\n\n\nEnabling HTCondor-CE\n\n\nIf you are installing HTCondor-CE on a new host, the default configuration is correct and you can skip this step and continue onto \nConfiguring the batch system\n! However, if you are updating a host that used a Globus GRAM job gateway (aka the Globus gatekeeper), you must disable GRAM and enable the HTCondor job gateway. Edit the gateway configuration file \n/etc/osg/config.d/10-gateway.ini\n so that it reads:\n\n\ngram_gateway_enabled = False\nhtcondor_gateway_enabled = True\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the batch system\n\n\nEnable your batch system by editing the \nenabled\n field in the \n/etc/osg/config.d/20-\nYOUR BATCH SYSTEM\n.ini\n\n\nenabled = \nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using HTCondor as your \nlocal batch system\n (i.e., in addition to your HTCondor-CE), skip to the \nconfiguring authentication\n section. For other batch systems (e.g., PBS, LSF, SGE, SLURM), keep reading.\n\n\nBatch systems other than HTCondor\n\n\nNon-HTCondor batch systems require additional configuration to support file transfer to your site's worker nodes.\n\n\nSharing the spool directory\n\n\nTo transfer files between the CE and the batch system, HTCondor-CE requires a shared file system. The current recommendation is to run a dedicated NFS server (whose installation is beyond the scope of this document) on the \nCE host\n. In this setup, HTCondor-CE writes to the local spool directory, the NFS server shares the directory, and each worker node mounts the directory in the same location as on the CE. For example, if your spool directory is \n/var/lib/condor-ce\n (the default), you must mount the shared directory to \n/var/lib/condor-ce\n on the worker nodes.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you choose not to host the NFS server on your CE, you will need to turn off root squash so that the HTCondor-CE daemons can write to the spool directory.\n\n\n\n\nYou can control the value of the spool directory by setting \nSPOOL\n in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n (create this file if it doesn't exist). For example, the following sets the \nSPOOL\n directory to \n/home/condor\n:\n\n\nSPOOL = /home/condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe shared spool directory must be readable and writeable by the \ncondor\n user for HTCondor-CE to function correctly.\n\n\n\n\nDisable worker node proxy renewal\n\n\nWorker node proxy renewal is not used by HTCondor-CE and leaving it on will cause some jobs to be held. Edit \n/etc/blah.config\n on the HTCondor-CE host and set the following values:\n\n\nblah_disable_wn_proxy_renewal=yes\nblah_delegate_renewed_proxies=no\nblah_disable_limited_proxy=yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere should be no whitespace around the \n=\n.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring authentication\n\n\nIn OSG 3.3, there are three methods to manage authentication for incoming jobs: the \nLCMAPS VOMS plugin\n, \nedg-mkgridmap\n and \nGUMS\n. edg-mkgridmap is easy to set up and maintain, and GUMS has more features and capabilities. The LCMAPS VOMS plugin is the new OSG-preferred authentication, offering the simplicity of edg-mkgridmap and many of GUMS' rich feature set. If you need to support \npool accounts\n, GUMS is the only software with that capability.\n\n\nIn OSG 3.4, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin is the only available authentication solution.\n\n\nAuthentication with the LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n\n\nTo configure your CE to use the LCMAPS VOMS plugin:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using OSG 3.3, add the following line to \n/etc/sysconfig/condor-ce\n:\n\n\nexport LLGT_VOMS_ENABLE_CREDENTIAL_CHECK=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the instructions in \nthe LCMAPS VOMS plugin installation and configuration document\n to prepare the LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf your local batch system is HTCondor, it will attempt to utilize the LCMAPS callouts if enabled in the \ncondor_mapfile\n. If this is not the desired behavior, set \nGSI_AUTHZ_CONF=/dev/null\n in the local HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication with edg-mkgridmap\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nedg-mkgridmap is unavailable in OSG 3.4\n\n\n\n\nTo configure your CE to use edg-mkgridmap:\n\n\n\n\nFollow the configuration instructions in \nthe edg-mkgridmap document\n to define the VOs that your site accepts\n\n\nSet some critical gridmap attributes by editing the \n/etc/osg/config.d/10-misc.ini\n file on the HTCondor-CE host:\nauthorization_method = gridmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication with GUMS\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nGUMS is unavailable in OSG 3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the instructions in \nthe GUMS installation and configuration document\n to prepare GUMS\n\n\nSet some critical GUMS attributes by editing the \n/etc/osg/config.d/10-misc.ini\n file on the HTCondor-CE host:\nauthorization_method = xacml\ngums_host = \nYOUR GUMS HOSTNAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf your local batch system is HTCondor, it will attempt to utilize the LCMAPS callouts if enabled in the \ncondor_mapfile\n. If this is not the desired behavior, set \nGSI_AUTHZ_CONF=/dev/null\n in the local HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring CE collector advertising\n\n\nTo split jobs between the various sites of the OSG, information about each site's capabilities are uploaded to a central collector. The job factories then query the central collector for idle resources and submit pilot jobs to the available sites. To advertise your site, you will need to enter some information about the worker nodes of your clusters.\n\n\nPlease see the \nSubcluster / Resource Entry configuration document\n about configuring the data that will be uploaded to the central collector.\n\n\nApplying configuration settings\n\n\nMaking changes to the OSG configuration files in the \n/etc/osg/config.d\n directory does not apply those settings to software automatically. Settings that are made outside of the OSG directory take effect immediately or at least when the relevant service is restarted. For the OSG settings, use the \nosg-configure\n tool to validate (to a limited extent) and apply the settings to the relevant software components. The \nosg-configure\n software is included automatically in an HTCondor-CE installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake all changes to \n.ini\n files in the \n/etc/osg/config.d\n directory\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis document describes the critical settings for HTCondor-CE and related software. You may need to configure other software that is installed on your HTCondor-CE host, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidate the configuration settings\n\n\nroot@host #\n osg-configure -v\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFix any errors (at least) that \nosg-configure\n reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the validation command succeeds without errors, apply the configuration settings:\n\n\nroot@host # osg-configure -c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a \nuser-vo-map\n file with your authentication set up (skip this step if you're using the LCMAPS VOMS plugin):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using edg-mkgridmap, run the following:\n\n\nroot@host #\n edg-mkgridmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using GUMS, run the following:\n\n\nroot@host #\n gums-host-cron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional configuration\n\n\nThe following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be required for setting up a small site. If you do not need any of the following special configurations, skip to \nthe section on using HTCondor-CE\n.\n\n\n\n\nTransforming and filtering jobs\n\n\nConfiguring for multiple network interfaces\n\n\nLimiting or disabling locally running jobs on the CE\n\n\nAccounting with multiple CEs or local user jobs\n\n\nHTCondor accounting groups\n\n\nInstalling the HTCondor-CE View\n\n\n\n\nTransforming and filtering jobs\n\n\nIf you need to modify or filter jobs, more information can be found in the \nJob Router Recipes\n document.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you need to assign jobs to HTCondor accounting groups, refer to \nthis\n section.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring for multiple network interfaces\n\n\nIf you have multiple network interfaces with different hostnames, the HTCondor-CE daemons need to know which hostname and interface to use when communicating to each other. Set \nNETWORK_HOSTNAME\n and \nNETWORK_INTERFACE\n to the hostname and IP address of your public interface, respectively, in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n directory with the line:\n\n\nNETWORK_HOSTNAME = \ncondorce.example.com\n\nNETWORK_INTERFACE = \n127.0.0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n text with your public interface\u2019s hostname and \n127.0.0.1\n with your public interface\u2019s IP address.\n\n\nLimiting or disabling locally running jobs on the CE\n\n\nIf you want to limit or disable jobs running locally on your CE, you will need to configure HTCondor-CE's local and scheduler universes. Local and scheduler universes are HTCondor-CE\u2019s analogue to GRAM\u2019s managed fork: they allow jobs to be run on the CE itself, mainly for remote troubleshooting. Pilot jobs will not run as local/scheduler universe jobs so leaving them enabled does NOT turn your CE into another worker node.\n\n\nThe two universes are effectively the same (scheduler universe launches a starter process for each job), so we will be configuring them in unison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the default limit\n on the number of locally run jobs (the current default is 20), add the following to \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE\n \n=\n TotalLocalJobsRunning + TotalSchedulerJobsRunning \n \nJOB-LIMIT\n\n\nSTART_SCHEDULER_UNIVERSE\n \n=\n \n$(\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo only allow a specific user\n to start locally run jobs, add the following to \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE\n \n=\n target.Owner \n=\n?\n=\n \nUSERNAME\n\n\nSTART_SCHEDULER_UNIVERSE\n \n=\n \n$(\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo disable\n locally run jobs, add the following to \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE\n \n=\n False\n\nSTART_SCHEDULER_UNIVERSE\n \n=\n \n$(\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nRSV requires the ability to start local universe jobs so if you are using RSV, you need to allow local universe jobs from the \nrsv\n user.\n\n\n\n\nAccounting with multiple CEs or local user jobs\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor non-HTCondor batch systems only\n\n\n\n\nIf your site has multiple CEs or you have non-grid users submitting to the same local batch system, the OSG accounting software needs to be configured so that it doesn't over report the number of jobs. Use the following table to determine which file requires editing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your batch system is\u2026\n\n\nThen edit the following file on your CE(s)\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLSF\n\n\n/etc/gratia/pbs-lsf/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS\n\n\n/etc/gratia/pbs-lsf/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSGE\n\n\n/etc/gratia/sge/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSLURM\n\n\n/etc/gratia/slurm/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen edit the value of \nSuppressNoDNRecords\n so that it reads:\n\n\nSuppressNoDNRecords=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor accounting groups\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor HTCondor batch systems only\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to provide fairshare on a group basis, as opposed to a Unix user basis, you can use HTCondor accounting groups. They are independent of the Unix groups the user may already be in and are \ndocumented in the HTCondor manual\n. If you are using HTCondor accounting groups, you can map jobs from the CE into HTCondor accounting groups based on their UID, their DN, or their VOMS attributes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo map UIDs to an accounting group,\n add entries to \n/etc/osg/uid_table.txt\n with the following form:\n\n\nuid GroupName\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an example \nuid_table.txt\n:\n\n\nuscms02 TestGroup\nosg     other.osgedu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo map DNs or VOMS attributes to an accounting group,\n add lines to \n/etc/osg/extattr_table.txt\n with the following form:\n\n\nSubjectOrAttribute\n GroupName\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nSubjectOrAttribute\n can be a Perl regular expression. The following is an example \nextattr_table.txt\n:\n\n\ncmsprio cms.other.prio\ncms\\/Role=production cms.prod\n\\/DC=com\\/DC=DigiCert-Grid\\/O=Open\\ Science\\ Grid\\/OU=People\\/CN=Brian\\ Lin\\ 1047 osg.test\n.* other\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nEntries in \n/etc/osg/uid_table.txt\n are honored over \n/etc/osg/extattr_table.txt\n if a job would match to lines in both files.\n\n\n\n\nInstall and run the HTCondor-CE View\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE View is an optional web interface to the status of your CE. To run the View,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin by installing the package htcondor-ce-view:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install htcondor-ce-view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, uncomment the \nDAEMON_LIST\n configuration located at \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/05-ce-view.conf\n:\n\n\nDAEMON_LIST\n \n=\n \n$(\nDAEMON_LIST\n)\n, CEVIEW, GANGLIAD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the CE service:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service condor-ce restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the service by entering your CE's hostname into your web browser\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe website is served on port 80 by default. To change this default, edit the value of \nHTCONDORCE_VIEW_PORT\n in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/05-ce-view.conf\n.\n\n\nUsing HTCondor-CE\n\n\nAs a site administrator, there are a few ways in which you might use the HTCondor-CE:\n\n\n\n\nManaging the HTCondor-CE and associated services\n\n\nUsing HTCondor-CE administrative tools to monitor and maintain the job gateway\n\n\nUsing HTCondor-CE user tools to test gateway operations\n\n\n\n\nManaging HTCondor-CE and associated services\n\n\nIn addition to the HTCondor-CE job gateway service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation. The specific services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch CRL\n\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n and \nfetch-crl-cron\n\n\nSee \nCA documentation\n for more info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGratia\n\n\ngratia-probes-cron\n\n\nAccounting software\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour batch system\n\n\ncondor\n or \npbs_server\n or \u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE\n\n\ncondor-ce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the services in the order listed and stop them in reverse order.

Note  If you choose not to host the NFS server on your CE, you will need to turn off root squash so that the HTCondor-CE daemons can write to the spool directory.

Customizations are made in the form of job routes where each route corresponds to a separate job transformation: If an incoming job matches a job route's requirements, the route creates a transformed job (referred to as the 'routed job') that is then submitted to the batch system. The CE package comes with default routes located in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-*.conf\n that provide enough basic functionality for a small site.\n\n\nIf you have needs beyond delegating all incoming jobs to your batch system as they are, this document provides examples of common job routes and job route problems.\n\n\nQuirks and Pitfalls\n\n\n\n\nThe JobRouter matches jobs to routes in a round-robin fashion (for HTCondor versions \n 8.7.1). This means that if a job can match to multiple routes, it can be routed by any of them! So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.\n\n\nIf a value is set in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n with \neval_set_\nvariable\n, override it by using \neval_set_\nvariable\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n. Do this at your own risk as it may cause the CE to break.\n\n\nMake sure to run \ncondor_ce_reconfig\n after changing your routes, otherwise they will not take effect.\n\n\nBefore the last square bracket, make sure all lines end in a line continuation character (backslash). You can inspect the syntax of your routes with \ncondor_ce_config_val JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n to see if HTCondor-CE has ingested them properly.\n\n\nDo \nnot\n set the job environment through the JobRouter.

Attributes that are \nset_\n in \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n will override those \nset_\n in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n is a configuration variable whose default is set in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-*.conf\n but may be overriden by the administrator in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n. This document outlines the many changes you can make to \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n to fit your site\u2019s needs.\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n is a python-generated configuration variable that sets default job route values that are required for the HTCondor-CE's functionality. To view its contents, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS \n|\n sed \ns/;/;\\n/g\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf a value is set in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n with \neval_set_\nvariable\n, override it by using \neval_set_\nvariable\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n. Do this at your own risk as it may cause the CE to break.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nDo \nnot\n set the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n configuration variable yourself. This will cause the CE to stop functioning.\n\n\n\n\nGeneric Routes\n\n\nThis section contains general information about job routes that can be used regardless of the type of batch system at your site. New routes should be placed in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n, not the original \n02-ce-*.conf\n.\n\n\nRequired fields\n\n\nThe minimum requirements for a route are that you specify the type of batch system that jobs should be routed to and a name for each route. Default routes can be found in \n/usr/share/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-\nbatch system\n-defaults.conf\n, provided by the \nosg-ce-\nbatch system\n packages.\n\n\nBatch system\n\n\nEach route needs to indicate the type of batch system that jobs should be routed to. For HTCondor batch systems, the \nTargetUniverse\n attribute needs to be set to \n5\n or \n\"vanilla\"\n. For all other batch systems, the \nTargetUniverse\n attribute needs to be set to \n9\n or \n\"grid\"\n and the \nGridResource\n attribute needs to be set to \n\"batch \nbatch system\n\"\n (where \nbatch system\n can be one of \npbs\n (for both users of \npbs\n and \nSLURM\n), \nlsf\n, or \nsge\n).\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     \nTargetUniverse = 5; \\\n\n     name = \nRoute jobs to HTCondor\n; \\\n] \\\n[ \\\n     \nGridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n\n     \nTargetUniverse = 9; \\\n\n     name = \nRoute jobs to PBS\n; \\\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nRoute name\n\n\nTo identify routes, you will need to assign a name to the route with the \nname\n attribute:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     \nname = \nRoute jobs to HTCondor\n; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the route will be useful in debugging since it shows up in the output of \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n, the \nJobRouterLog\n, and in the ClassAd of the routed job, which can be viewed with \ncondor_ce_q\n or \ncondor_ce_history\n.\n\n\nWriting multiple routes\n\n\nIf your batch system needs incoming jobs to be sorted (e.g. if different VO's need to go to separate queues), you will need to write multiple job routes. Each route is enclosed by square brackets and unless they're the last closing bracket, they need to be followed by the line continuation character. The following routes takes incoming jobs that have a \nqueue\n attribute set to \n\"analy\"\n and routes them to the site's HTCondor batch system. Any other jobs will be sent to that site's PBS batch system.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor versions of HTCondor \n 8.7.1, the JobRouter matches jobs to routes in a round-robin fashion. This means that if a job can match to multiple routes, it can be routed by any of them! So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.\n\n\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = \n[ \\\n\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nRoute jobs to HTCondor\n; \\\n     Requirements = (TARGET.queue =?= \nanaly\n); \\\n\n] \\\n[ \\\n\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nRoute jobs to PBS\n; \\\n     Requirements = (TARGET.queue =!= \nanaly\n); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting comments\n\n\nTo write comments you can use C-style comments, text enclosed by \n/* */\n. If the comment is at the end of a line, it still has to be followed by the line continuation character.\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nC-style comments\n; \\\n     \n/* This is a comment */ \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use \n#\n to comment out single lines:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nHash comments\n; \\\n     \n# BrokenAttribute = \ncommented out\n; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting attributes for all routes\n\n\nTo set an attribute that will be applied to all routes, you will need to ensure that \nMERGE_JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULT_ADS\n is set to \nTrue\n (check the value with \ncondor_ce_config_val\n) and use the \nset_\n function in the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n. The following configuration sets the \nPeriodic_Hold\n attribute for all routes:\n\n\n# Use the defaults generated by the condor_ce_router_defaults script.  To add\n\n\n# additional defaults, add additional lines of the form:\n\n\n#\n\n\n#   JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS = $(JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS) [set_foo = 1;]\n\n\n#\n\n\nMERGE_JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULT_ADS\n=\nTrue\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n \n=\n \n$(\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n)\n \n[\nset_Periodic_Hold\n \n=\n \n(\nNumJobStarts \n=\n \n1\n \n \nJobStatus\n \n==\n \n1\n)\n \n||\n NumJobStarts \n \n1\n;\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering jobs based on\u2026\n\n\nTo filter jobs, use the \nRequirements\n attribute. Jobs will evaluate against the ClassAd expression set in the \nRequirements\n and if the expression evaluates to \nTRUE\n, the route will match. More information on the syntax of ClassAd's can be found in the \nHTCondor manual\n. For an example on how incoming jobs interact with filtering in job routes, consult \nthis document\n.\n\n\nWhen setting requirements, you need to prefix job attributes that you are filtering with \nTARGET.\n so that the job route knows to compare the attribute of the incoming job rather than the route\u2019s own attribute. For example, if an incoming job has a \nqueue = \"analy\"\n attribute, then the following job route will not match:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by queue\n; \\\n     queue = \nnot-analy\n; \\\n     \nRequirements = (queue =?= \nanaly\n); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is because when evaluating the route requirement, the job route will compare its own \nqueue\n attribute to \"analy\" and see that it does not match. You can read more about comparing two ClassAds in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you have an HTCondor batch system, note the difference with \nset_requirements\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\nFor versions of HTCondor \n 8.7.1, the JobRouter matches jobs to routes in a round-robin fashion. This means that if a job can match to multiple routes, it can be routed by any of them! So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlidein queue\n\n\nTo filter jobs based on their glidein queue attribute, your routes will need a \nRequirements\n expression using the incoming job's \nqueue\n attribute. The following entry routes jobs to the PBS queue if the incoming job (specified by \nTARGET\n) is an \nanaly\n (Analysis) glidein:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by queue\n; \\\n     \nRequirements = (TARGET.queue =?= \nanaly\n); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nJob submitter\n\n\nTo filter jobs based on who submitted it, your routes will need a \nRequirements\n expression using the incoming job's \nOwner\n attribute. The following entry routes jobs to the HTCondor batch system iff the submitter is \nusatlas2\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by job submitter\n; \\\n     \nRequirements = (TARGET.Owner =?= \nusatlas2\n); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can match based on regular expression. The following entry routes jobs to the PBS batch system iff the submitter's name begins with \nusatlas\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by job submitter (regular expression)\n; \\\n     \nRequirements = regexp(\n^usatlas\n, TARGET.Owner); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nVOMS attribute\n\n\nTo filter jobs based on the subject of the job's proxy, your routes will need a \nRequirements\n expression using the incoming job's \nx509UserProxyFirstFQAN\n attribute. The following entry routes jobs to the PBS batch system if the proxy subject contains \n/cms/Role=Pilot\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nFiltering by VOMS attribute (regex)\n; \\\n     \nRequirements = regexp(\n\\/cms\\/Role\\=pilot\n, TARGET.x509UserProxyFirstFQAN); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting a default\u2026\n\n\nThis section outlines how to set default job limits, memory, cores, queue, and maximum walltime. For an example on how users can override these defaults, consult \nthis document\n.\n\n\nMaximum number of jobs\n\n\nTo set a default limit to the maximum number of jobs per route, you can edit the configuration variable \nCONDORCE_MAX_JOBS\n in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/01-ce-router.conf\n:\n\n\nCONDORCE_MAX_JOBS = 10000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe above configuration  is to be placed directly into the HTCondor-CE configuration, not into a job route.\n\n\n\n\nMaximum memory\n\n\nTo set a default maximum memory for routed jobs, set the attribute \ndefault_maxMemory\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nRequest memory\n; \\\n     /* Set the requested memory to 1 GB */ \\\n     \nset_default_maxMemory = 1000; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of cores to request\n\n\nTo set a default number of cores for routed jobs, set the attribute \ndefault_xcount\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nRequest CPU\n; \\\n     /* Set the requested cores to 8 */ \\\n     \nset_default_xcount = 8; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum walltime\n\n\nTo set a default maximum walltime (in minutes) for routed jobs, set the attribute \ndefault_maxWallTime\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nSetting WallTime\n; \\\n     /* Set the max walltime to 1 hr */ \\\n     \nset_default_maxWallTime = 60; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nEditing attributes\u2026\n\n\nThe following functions are operations that affect job attributes and are evaluated in the following order:\n\n\n\n\ncopy_*\n\n\ndelete_*\n\n\nset_*\n\n\neval_set_*\n\n\n\n\nAfter each job route\u2019s ClassAd is \nconstructed\n, the above operations are evaluated in order. For example, if the attribute \nfoo\n is set using \neval_set_foo\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n, you'll be unable to use \ndelete_foo\n to remote it from your jobs since the attribute is set using \neval_set_foo\n after the deletion occurs according to the order of operations. To get around this, we can take advantage of the fact that operations defined in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n get overriden by the same operation in \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n. So to 'delete' \nfoo\n, we would add \neval_set_foo = \"\"\n to the route in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n, resulting in \nfoo\n being absent from the routed job.\n\n\nMore documentation can be found in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\nCopying attributes\n\n\nTo copy the value of an attribute of the incoming job to an attribute of the routed job, use \ncopy_\n. The following route copies the \nenvironment\n attribute of the incoming job and sets the attribute \nOriginal_Environment\n on the routed job to the same value:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nCopying attributes\n; \\\n     \ncopy_environment = \nOriginal_Environment\n; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving attributes\n\n\nTo remove an attribute of the incoming job from the routed job, use \ndelete_\n. The following route removes the \nenvironment\n attribute from the routed job:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nCopying attributes\n; \\\n     \ndelete_environment = True; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting attributes\n\n\nTo set an attribute on the routed job, use \nset_\n. The following route sets the Job's \nRank\n attribute to 5:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nSetting an attribute\n; \\\n     \nset_Rank = 5; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting attributes with ClassAd expressions\n\n\nTo set an attribute to a ClassAd expression to be evaluated, use \nset_eval\n. The following route sets the \nExperiment\n attribute to \natlas.osguser\n if the Owner of the incoming job is \nosguser\n:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf a value is set in JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS with \neval_set_\nvariable\n, override it by using \neval_set_\nvariable\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n.\n\n\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nSetting an attribute with a !ClassAd expression\n; \\\n     \neval_set_Experiment = strcat(\natlas.\n, Owner); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nLimiting the number of...\n\n\nThis section outlines how to limit the number of total or idle jobs in a specific route (i.e., if this limit is reached, jobs will no longer be placed in this route).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are using an HTCondor batch system, limiting the number of jobs is not the preferred solution: HTCondor manages fair share on its own via \nuser priorities and group accounting\n.\n\n\n\n\nTotal jobs\n\n\nTo set a limit on the number of jobs for a specific route, set the \nMaxJobs\n attribute:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nLimit the total number of jobs to 100\n; \\\n     \nMaxJobs = 100; \\\n\n] \\\n[ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nLimit the total number of jobs to 75\n; \\\n     \nMaxJobs = 75; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nIdle jobs\n\n\nTo set a limit on the number of idle jobs for a specific route, set the \nMaxIdleJobs\n attribute:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nLimit the total number of idle jobs to 100\n; \\\n     \nMaxIdleJobs = 100; \\\n\n] \\\n[ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nLimit the total number of idle jobs to 75\n; \\\n     \nMaxIdleJobs = 75; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugging routes\n\n\nTo help debug expressions in your routes, you can use the \ndebug()\n function. First, set the debug mode for the JobRouter by editing a file in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/\n to read\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG\n\n\n\n\n\nThen wrap the problematic attribute in \ndebug()\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nDebugging a difficult !ClassAd expression\n; \\\n     \neval_set_Experiment = debug(strcat(\natlas\n, Name)); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will find the debugging output in \n/var/log/condor-ce/JobRouterLog\n.\n\n\nRoutes for HTCondor Batch Systems\n\n\nThis section contains information about job routes that can be used if you are running an HTCondor batch system at your site.\n\n\nSetting periodic hold, release or remove\n\n\nTo release, remove or put a job on hold if it meets certain criteria, use the \nPERIODIC_*\n family of attributes. By default, periodic expressions are evaluated once every 300 seconds but this can be changed by setting \nPERIODIC_EXPR_INTERVAL\n in your CE's configuration.\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nSetting periodic statements\n; \\\n     \n/* Puts the routed job on hold if the job\ns been idle and has been started at least once or if the job has tried to start more than once */ \\\n     set_Periodic_Hold = (NumJobStarts \n= 1 \n JobStatus == 1) || NumJobStarts \n 1; \\\n     /* Remove routed jobs if their walltime is longer than 3 days and 5 minutes */ \\\n     set_Periodic_Remove = ( RemoteWallClockTime \n (3*24*60*60 + 5*60) ); \\\n     /* Release routed jobs if the condor_starter couldn\nt start the executable and \nVMGAHP_ERR_INTERNAL\n is in the HoldReason */ \\\n     set_Periodic_Release = HoldReasonCode == 6 \n regexp(\nVMGAHP_ERR_INTERNAL\n, HoldReason); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting routed job requirements\n\n\nIf you need to set requirements on your routed job, you will need to use \nset_Requirements\n instead of \nRequirements\n. The \nRequirements\n attribute filters jobs coming into your CE into different job routes whereas \nset_requirements\n will set conditions on the routed job that must be met by the worker node it lands on. For more information on requirements, consult the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\nTo ensure that your job lands on a Linux machine in your pool:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     \nset_Requirements =  OpSys == \nLINUX\n; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting accounting groups\n\n\nTo assign jobs to an HTCondor accounting group to manage fair share on your local batch system, we recommend using \nUID and ExtAttr tables\n.\n\n\nRoutes for non-HTCondor Batch Systems\n\n\nThis section contains information about job routes that can be used if you are running a non-HTCondor batch system at your site.\n\n\nSetting a default batch queue\n\n\nTo set a default queue for routed jobs, set the attribute \ndefault_queue\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nSetting batch system queues\n; \\\n     \nset_default_queue = \nosg_queue\n; \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting batch system directives\n\n\nTo write batch system directives that are not supported in the route examples above, you will need to edit the job submit script for your local batch system in \n/etc/blahp/\n (e.g., if your local batch system is PBS, edit \n/etc/blahp/pbs_local_submit_attributes.sh\n). This file is sourced during submit time and anything printed to stdout is appended to the batch system job submit script. ClassAd attributes can be passed from the routed job to the local submit attributes script via the \ndefault_remote_cerequirements\n attribute, which can take the following form:\n\n\ndefault_remote_cerequirements = \nfoo == X \n bar == \\\nY\\\n \n ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sets \nfoo\n to value \nX\n and \nbar\n to the string \nY\n (escaped double-quotes are required for string values) in the environment of the local submit attributes script. The following example sets the maximum walltime to 1 hour and the accounting group to the \nx509UserProxyFirstFQAN\n attribute of the job submitted to a PBS batch system\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n; \\\n     TargetUniverse = 9; \\\n     name = \nSetting job submit variables\n; \\\n     \nset_default_remote_cerequirements = strcat(\nWalltime == 3600 \n AccountingGroup == \\\n, x509UserProxyFirstFQAN, \n\\\n); \\\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nWith \n/etc/blahp/pbs_local_submit_attributes.sh\n containing.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\necho\n \n#PBS -l walltime=\n$Walltime\n\n\necho\n \n#PBS -A \n$AccountingGroup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in the following being appended to the script that gets submitted to your batch system:\n\n\n#PBS -l walltime=3600\n#PBS -A \nCE job\ns x509UserProxyFirstFQAN attribute\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\n\nHere are some other HTCondor-CE documents that might be helpful:\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE overview and architecture\n\n\nInstalling HTCondor-CE\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE troubleshooting guide\n\n\nSubmitting jobs to HTCondor-CE\n\n\n\n\nExample Configurations\n\n\nAGLT2's job routes\n\n\nAtlas AGLT2 is using an HTCondor batch system.

Here are some things to note about their routes:\n\n\n\n\nSetting various HTCondor-specific attributes like \nJobLeaseDuration\n, \nRequirements\n and \nPeriodic_Hold\n (see the \nHTCondor manual\n for more). Some of these are site-specific like \nRACF_Group\n, \nExperiment\n, \nJob_Type\n and \nVO\n.\n\n\nJobs are split into different routes based on the \nGlideIn\n queue that they're in.\n\n\nThere is a difference between \nRequirements\n and \nset_requirements\n. The \nRequirements\n attribute matches \nincoming\n jobs to specific routes while the \nset_requirements\n sets the \nRequirements\n attribute on the \nrouted\n job, which confines which machines that the routed job can land on.\n\n\n\n\nSource:

            "text": "Atlas BNL T1, they are using an HTCondor batch system. Here are some things to note about their routes:   Setting various HTCondor-specific attributes like  JobLeaseDuration ,  Requirements  and  Periodic_Hold  (see the  HTCondor manual  for more). Some of these are site-specific like  RACF_Group ,  Experiment ,  Job_Type  and  VO .  Jobs are split into different routes based on the  GlideIn  queue that they're in.  There is a difference between  Requirements  and  set_requirements . The  Requirements  attribute matches  incoming  jobs to specific routes while the  set_requirements  sets the  Requirements  attribute on the  routed  job, which confines which machines that the routed job can land on.

            "text": "HTCondor-CE Troubleshooting Guide\n\n\nIn this document, you will find a collection of files and commands to help troubleshoot HTCondor-CE along with a list of common issues with suggested troubleshooting steps.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS are not applied to jobs on the local HTCondor\n\n\nIf you are adding attributes to jobs submitted to your HTCondor pool with \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n, these will \nnot\n be applied to jobs that are entering your pool from the HTCondor-CE. To get around this, you will want to add the attributes to your \njob routes\n. If the CE is the only entry point for jobs into your pool, you can get rid of \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n on your backend. Otherwise, you will have to maintain your list of attributes both in your list of routes and in your \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n.\n\n\nGeneral Troubleshooting Items\n\n\nMaking sure packages are up-to-date\n\n\nIt is important to make sure that the HTCondor-CE and related RPMs are up-to-date.\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update \nhtcondor-ce*\n blahp condor\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you just want to see the packages to update, but do not want to perform the update now, answer \nN\n at the prompt.\n\n\nVerify package contents\n\n\nIf the contents of your HTCondor-CE packages have been changed, the CE may cease to function properly. To verify the contents of your packages (ignoring changes to configuration files):\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -q --verify htcondor-ce htcondor-ce-client blahp \n|\n awk \n$2 != \nc\n {print $0}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the verification command returns output, this means that your packages have been changed. To fix this, you can reinstall the packages:\n\n\nuser@host $\n yum reinstall htcondor-ce htcondor-ce-client blahp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe reinstall command may place original versions of configuration files alongside the versions that you have modified. If this is the case, the reinstall command will notify you that the original versions will have an \n.rpmnew\n suffix. Further inspection of these files may be required as to whether or not you need to merge them into your current configuration.\n\n\n\n\nVerify clocks are synchronized\n\n\nLike all GSI-based authentication, HTCondor-CE is sensitive to time skews. Make sure the clock on your CE is synchronized using a utility such as \nntpd\n. Additionally, HTCondor itself is sensitive to time skews on the NFS server. If you see empty stdout / err being returned to the submitter, verify there is no NFS server time skew.\n\n\nHTCondor-CE Troubleshooting Items\n\n\nThis section contains common issues you may encounter using HTCondor-CE and next actions to take when you do. Before troubleshooting, we recommend increasing the log level:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite the following into \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n to increase the log level for all daemons:\n\n\nALL_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that the configuration is in place:\n\n\nroot@host # condor_ce_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproduce the issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBefore spending any time on troubleshooting, you should ensure that the state of configuration is as expected by running \ncondor_ce_reconfig\n.\n\n\n\n\nDaemons fail to start\n\n\nIf there are errors in your configuration of HTCondor-CE, this may cause some of its required daemons to fail to startup. Check the following subsections in order:\n\n\nSymptoms\n\n\nDaemon startup failure may manifest in many ways, the following are few symptoms of the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service fails to start:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service condor-ce start\n\nStarting Condor-CE daemons: [ FAIL ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n fails with a lengthy error message:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q\n\nError:\n\n\n\nExtra Info: You probably saw this error because the condor_schedd is not running\n\n\non the machine you are trying to query. If the condor_schedd is not running, the\n\n\nCondor system will not be able to find an address and port to connect to and\n\n\nsatisfy this request. Please make sure the Condor daemons are running and try\n\n\nagain.\n\n\n\nExtra Info: If the condor_schedd is running on the machine you are trying to\n\n\nquery and you still see the error, the most likely cause is that you have setup\n\n\na personal Condor, you have not defined SCHEDD_NAME in your condor_config file,\n\n\nand something is wrong with your SCHEDD_ADDRESS_FILE setting. You must define\n\n\neither or both of those settings in your config file, or you must use the -name\n\n\noption to condor_q. Please see the Condor manual for details on SCHEDD_NAME and\n\n\nSCHEDD_ADDRESS_FILE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nIf the MasterLog is filled with \nERROR:SECMAN...TCP connection to collector...failed\n:\n This is likely due to a misconfiguration for a host with multiple network interfaces. Verify that you have followed the instructions in \nthis\n section of the install guide.\n\n\nIf the MasterLog is filled with \nDC_AUTHENTICATE\n errors:\n The HTCondor-CE daemons use the host certificate to authenticate with each other. Verify that your host certificate\u2019s DN matches one of the regular expressions found in \n/etc/condor-ce/condor_mapfile\n.\n\n\nIf the SchedLog is filled with \nCan\u2019t find address for negotiator\n:\n You can ignore this error! The negotiator daemon is used in HTCondor batch systems to match jobs with resources but since HTCondor-CE does not manage any resources directly, it does not run one.\n\n\n\n\nJobs fail to submit to the CE\n\n\nIf a user is having issues submitting jobs to the CE and you've ruled out general connectivity or firewalls as the culprit, then you may have encountered an authentication or authorization issue. You may see error messages like the following in your \nSchedLog\n:\n\n\n08/30/16 16:52:56 DC_AUTHENTICATE: required authentication of 72.33.0.189 failed: AUTHENTICATE:1003:Failed to authenticate with any method|AUTHENTICATE:1004:Failed to authenticate using GSI|GSI:5002:Failed to authenticate because the remote (client) side was not able to acquire its credentials.|AUTHENTICATE:1004:Failed to authenticate using FS|FS:1004:Unable to lstat(/tmp/FS_XXXZpUlYa)\n08/30/16 16:53:12 PERMISSION DENIED to gsi@unmapped from host 72.33.0.189 for command 60021 (DC_NOP_WRITE), access level WRITE: reason: WRITE authorization policy contains no matching ALLOW entry for this request; identifiers used for this host: 72.33.0.189,dyn-72-33-0-189.uwnet.wisc.edu, hostname size = 1, original ip address = 72.33.0.189\n08/30/16 16:53:12 DC_AUTHENTICATE: Command not authorized, done!\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nCheck GUMS or grid-mapfile\n and ensure that the user's DN is known to your \nauthentication method\n\n\nCheck for lcmaps errors\n in \n/var/log/messages\n\n\nIf you do not see helpful error messages in \n/var/log/messages\n,\n adjust the debug level by adding \nexport LCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL=5\n to \n/etc/sysconfig/condor-ce\n, restarting the condor-ce service, and checking \n/var/log/messages\n for errors again.\n\n\n\n\nJobs stay idle on the CE\n\n\nCheck the following subsections in order, but note that jobs may take several minutes or longer to run if the CE is busy.\n\n\nIdle jobs on CE: Is the job router handling the incoming job?\n\n\nJobs on the CE will be put on hold if they do not match any job routes after 30 minutes, but you can check a few things if you suspect that the jobs are not being matched. Check if the JobRouter sees a job before that by looking at the \njob router log\n and looking for the text \nsrc=\nJOB-ID\n\u2026claimed job\n.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n to see why your idle job does not match any routes\n\n\nIdle jobs on CE: Verify correct operation between the CE and your local batch system\n\n\nFor HTCondor batch systems\n\n\nHTCondor-CE submits jobs directly to an HTCondor batch system via the JobRouter, so any issues with the CE/local batch system interaction will appear in the \nJobRouterLog\n.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nCheck the \nJobRouterLog\n for failures.\n\n\nVerify that the local HTCondor is functional.\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_config_val\n to verify that the \nJOB_ROUTER_SCHEDD2_NAME\n, \nJOB_ROUTER_SCHEDD2_POOL\n, and \nJOB_ROUTER_SCHEDD2_SPOOL\n configuration variables are set to the hostname of your CE, the hostname and port of your local HTCondor\u2019s collector, and the location of your local HTCondor\u2019s spool directory, respectively.\n\n\nUse \ncondor_config_val QUEUE_SUPER_USER_MAY_IMPERSONATE\n and verify that it is set to \n.*\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor non-HTCondor batch systems\n\n\nHTCondor-CE submits jobs to a non-HTCondor batch system via the Gridmanager, so any issues with the CE/local batch system interaction will appear in the \nGridmanagerLog\n. Look for \ngm state change\u2026\n lines to figure out where the issures are occuring.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nIf you see failures in the GridmanagerLog during job submission:\n Save the submit files by adding the appropriate entry to \nblah.config\n and submit it \nmanually\n to the batch system. If that succeeds, make sure that the BLAHP knows where your binaries are located by setting the \nbatch system\n_binpath\n in \n/etc/blah.config\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you see failures in the GridmanagerLog during queries for job status:\n Query the resultant job with your batch system tools from the CE. If you can, the BLAHP uses scripts to query for status in \n/usr/libexec/blahp/\nbatch system\n_status.sh\n (e.g., \n/usr/libexec/blahp/lsf_status.sh\n) that take the argument \nbatch system/YYYMMDD/job ID\n (e.g., \nlsf/20141008/65053\n). Run the appropriate status script for your batch system and upon success, you should see the following output:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /usr/libexec/blahp/lsf_status.sh lsf/20141008/65053\n\n[ BatchjobId = \n894862\n; JobStatus = 4; ExitCode = 0; WorkerNode = \natl-prod08\n ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the script fails, \nrequest help\n from the OSG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdle jobs on CE: Make sure the underlying batch system can run jobs\n\n\nHTCondor-CE communicates directly with an HTCondor batch system schedd, so if jobs are not running, examine the \nSchedLog\n and diagnose the problem from there. For other batch systems, the BLAHP is used to submit jobs using your batch system\u2019s job submission binaries, whose location is specified in \n/etc/blah.config\n.\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\nManually create and submit a simple job (e.g., one that runs \nsleep\n)\n\n\nCheck for errors in the submission itself\n\n\nWatch the job in the batch system queue (e.g., using \ncondor_q\n)\n\n\nIf the job does not run, check for errors on the batch system\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\nIf the underlying batch system does not run a simple manual job, it will probably not run a job coming from HTCondor-CE. Once you can run simple manual jobs on your batch system, try submitting to the HTCondor-CE again.\n\n\nIdle jobs on CE: Verify ability to change permissions on key files\n\n\nHTCondor-CE needs the ability to write and chown files in its \nspool\n directory and if it cannot, jobs will not run at all. Spool permission errors can appear in the \nSchedLog\n and the \nJobRouterLog\n.\n\n\nSymptoms\n\n\n09/17/14 14:45:42 Error: Unable to chown \n/var/lib/condor-ce/spool/1/0/cluster1.proc0.subproc0/env\n from 12345 to 54321\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nAs root, try to change ownership of the file or directory in question. If the file does not exist, a parent directory may have improper permissions.\n\n\nVerify that there aren't any underlying file system issues in the specified location\n\n\n\n\nJobs stay idle on a remote host submitting to the CE\n\n\nIf you are submitting your job from a separate submit host to the CE, it stays idle in the queue forever, and you do not see a resultant job in the CE's queue, this means that your job cannot contact the CE for submission or it is not authorized to run there. Note that jobs may take several minutes or longer if the CE is busy.\n\n\nRemote idle jobs: Can you contact the CE?\n\n\nTo check basic connectivity to a CE, use \ncondor_ce_ping\n:\n\n\nSymptoms\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ping -verbose -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 WRITE\n\nERROR: couldn\nt locate condorce.example.com!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the HTCondor-CE daemons are running with \ncondor_ce_status\n.\n\n\nVerify that your CE is reachable from your submit host, replacing \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of your CE:\nuser@host $\n ping condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote idle jobs: Are you authorized to run jobs on the CE?\n\n\nThe CE will only accept jobs from users that authenticate via LCMAPS, grid mapfile, or GUMS.

You can check the status of your proxy with the following\n\n\nuser@host $\n voms-proxy-info -all\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\nEnsure that the owner of the job generates their proxy with \nvoms-proxy-init\n.\n\n\nHeld jobs: Invalid job universe\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE only accepts jobs that have \nuniverse\n in their submit files set to \nvanilla\n, \nstandard\n, \nlocal\n, or \nscheduler\n. These universes also have corresponding integer values that can be found in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nEnsure jobs submitted locally, from the CE host, are submitted with \nuniverse = vanilla\n\n\n\n\nEnsure jobs submitted from a remote submit point are submitted with:\n\n\nuniverse = grid\ngrid_resource = condor condorce.example.com condorce.example.com:9619\n\n\n\n\n\nreplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeld jobs: Non-existent route or entry in JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n\n\nJobs on the CE will be put on hold if they do not match any job routes within 30 minutes.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n to see why your idle job does not match any routes.\n\n\nIdentifying the corresponding job ID on the local batch system\n\n\nWhen troubleshooting interactions between your CE and your local batch system, you will need to associate the CE job ID and the resultant job ID on the batch system. The methods for finding the resultant job ID differs between batch systems.\n\n\nHTCondor batch systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect the CE\u2019s job ad, use \ncondor_ce_q\n or \ncondor_ce_history\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_q\n if the job is still in the CE\u2019s queue:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q \nJOB-ID\n -af RoutedToJobId\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_history\n if the job has left the CE\u2019s queue:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_history \nJOB-ID\n -af RoutedToJobId\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParse the \nJobRouterLog\n for the CE\u2019s job ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-HTCondor batch systems\n\n\nWhen HTCondor-CE records the corresponding batch system job ID, it is written in the form \nBATCH-SYSTEM\n/\nDATE\n/\nJOB ID\n:\n\n\nlsf/20141206/482046\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect the CE\u2019s job ad, use \ncondor_ce_q\n:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q \nJOB-ID\n -af GridJobId\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParse the \nGridmanagerLog\n for the CE\u2019s job ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs removed from the local HTCondor pool become resubmitted (HTCondor batch systems only)\n\n\nBy design, HTCondor-CE will resubmit jobs that have been removed from the underlying HTCondor pool. Therefore, to remove misbehaving jobs, they will need to be removed on the CE level following these steps:\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the misbehaving job ID in your batch system queue\n\n\n\n\nFind the job's corresponding CE job ID:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_q \nJOB-ID\n -af RoutedFromJobId\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_rm\n to remove the CE job from the queue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing HTCondor tools\n\n\nMost of the HTCondor-CE tools are just wrappers around existing HTCondor tools that load the CE-specific config. If you are trying to use HTCondor-CE tools and you see the following error:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_job_router_info\n\n/usr/bin/condor_ce_job_router_info: line 6: exec: condor_job_router_info: not found\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that the \ncondor_job_router_info\n (note this is not the CE version), is not in your \nPATH\n.\n\n\nNext Actions\n\n\n\n\nEither the condor RPM is missing or there are some other issues with it (try \nrpm --verify condor\n).\n\n\nYou have installed HTCondor in a non-standard location that is not in your \nPATH\n.\n\n\nThe \ncondor_job_router_info\n tool itself wasn't available until Condor-8.2.3-1.1 (available in osg-upcoming).\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE Troubleshooting Tools\n\n\nHTCondor-CE has its own separate set of of the HTCondor tools with \nce\n in the name (i.e., \ncondor_ce_submit\n vs \ncondor_submit\n). Some of the the commands are only for the CE (e.g., \ncondor_ce_run\n and \ncondor_ce_trace\n) but many of them are just HTCondor commands configured to interact with the CE (e.g., \ncondor_ce_q\n, \ncondor_ce_status\n). It is important to differentiate the two: \ncondor_ce_config_val\n will provide configuration values for your HTCondor-CE while \ncondor_config_val\n will provide configuration values for your HTCondor batch system. If you are not running an HTCondor batch system, the non-CE commands will return errors.\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n\n\nUsage\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n is a useful tool for testing end-to-end job submission. It contacts both the CE\u2019s Schedd and Collector daemons to verify your permission to submit to the CE, displays the submit script that it submits to the CE, and tracks the resultant job.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou must have generated a proxy (e.g., \nvoms-proxy-init\n) and your DN must be added to your \nchosen authentication method\n.\n\n\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_trace condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing the \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE. If you are familiar with the output of condor commands, the command also takes a \n--debug\n option that displays verbose condor output.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nIf the command fails with \u201cFailed ping\u2026\u201d:\n Make sure that the HTCondor-CE daemons are running on the CE\n\n\nIf you see \u201cgsi@unmapped\u201d in the \u201cRemote Mapping\u201d line:\n Either your credentials are not mapped on the CE or authentication is not set up at all. To set up authentication, refer to our \ninstallation document\n.\n\n\nIf the job submits but does not complete:\n Look at the status of the job and perform the relevant \ntroubleshooting steps\n.\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_run\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nSimilar to \nglobus-job-run\n, \ncondor_ce_run\n is a tool that submits a simple job to your CE, so it is useful for quickly submitting jobs through your CE. To submit a job to the CE and run the \nenv\n command on the remote batch system:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou must have generated a proxy (e.g., \nvoms-proxy-init\n) and your DN must be added to your \nchosen authentication method\n.\n\n\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_run -r condorce.example.com:9619 /bin/env\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing the \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE. If you are troubleshooting an HTCondor-CE that you do not have a login for and the CE accepts local universe jobs, you can run commands locally on the CE with \ncondor_ce_run\n with the \n-l\n option. The following example outputs the JobRouterLog of the CE in question:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_run -lr condorce.example.com:9619 cat /var/log/condor-ce/JobRouterLog\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing the \ncondorce.example.com\n text with the hostname of the CE. To disable this feature on your CE, consult \nthis\n section of the install documentation.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not see any results:\n \ncondor_ce_run\n does not display results until the job completes on the CE, which may take several minutes or longer if the CE is busy. In the meantime, can use \ncondor_ce_q\n in a separate terminal to track the job on the CE. If you never see any results, use \ncondor_ce_trace\n to pinpoint errors.\n\n\nIf you see an error message that begins with \u201cFailed to\u2026\u201d:\n Check connectivity to the CE with \ncondor_ce_trace\n or \ncondor_ce_ping\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_submit\n\n\nSee the \nsubmitting to HTCondor-CE\n document for details.\n\n\ncondor_ce_ping\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nUse the following \ncondor_ce_ping\n command to test your ability to submit jobs to an HTCondor-CE, replacing \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of your CE:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_ping -verbose -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 WRITE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following shows successful output where I am able to submit jobs (\nAuthorized: TRUE\n) as the glow user (\nRemote Mapping: glow@users.opensciencegrid.org\n):\n\n\nRemote Version:              $CondorVersion: 8.0.7 Sep 24 2014 $\n\n\nLocal  Version:              $CondorVersion: 8.0.7 Sep 24 2014 $\n\n\nSession ID:                  condorce:27407:1412286981:3\n\n\nInstruction:                 WRITE\n\n\nCommand:                     60021\n\n\nEncryption:                  none\n\n\nIntegrity:                   MD5\n\n\nAuthenticated using:         GSI\n\n\nAll authentication methods:  GSI\n\n\nRemote Mapping:              glow@users.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\nAuthorized:                  TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you run the \ncondor_ce_ping\n command on the CE that you are testing, omit the \n-name\n and \n-pool\n options. \ncondor_ce_ping\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_ping\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see \u201cERROR: couldn\u2019t locate (null)\u201d\n, that means the HTCondor-CE schedd (the daemon that schedules jobs) cannot be reached. To track down the issue, increase debugging levels on the CE:\n\n\nMASTER_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG\nSCHEDD_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG\n\n\n\n\n\nThen look in the \nMasterLog\n and \nSchedLog\n for any errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see \u201cgsi@unmapped\u201d in the \u201cRemote Mapping\u201d line\n, this means that either your credentials are not mapped on the CE or that authentication is not set up at all. To set up authentication, refer to our \ninstallation document\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n\n\nUsage\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n can display job status or specific job attributes for jobs that are still in the CE\u2019s queue. To list jobs that are queued on a CE:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect the full ClassAd for a specific job, specify the \n-l\n flag and the job ID:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 -l \nJOB-ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you run the \ncondor_ce_q\n command on the CE that you are testing, omit the \n-name\n and \n-pool\n options. \ncondor_ce_q\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_q\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf the jobs that you are submiting to a CE are not completing, \ncondor_ce_q\n can tell you the status of your jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the schedd is not running:\n You will see a lengthy message about being unable to contact the schedd. To track down the issue, increase the debugging levels on the CE with:\n\n\nMASTER_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG\nSCHEDD_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG\n\n\n\n\n\nTo apply these changes, reconfigure HTCondor-CE:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\nThen look in the \nMasterLog\n and \nSchedLog\n on the CE for any errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are issues with contacting the collector:\n You will see the following message:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -pool ce1.accre.vanderbilt.edu -name ce1.accre.vanderbilt.edu\n\n\n-- Failed to fetch ads from: \n129.59.197.223:9620?sock`33630_8b33_4\n : ce1.accre.vanderbilt.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may be due to network issues or bad HTCondor daemon permissions.

To see all of your routes (the output is long because it combines your routes with the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n configuration variable):\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_job_router_info -config\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see how the job router is handling a job that is currently in the CE\u2019s queue, analyze the output of \ncondor_ce_q\n (replace the \nJOB-ID\n with the job ID that you are interested in):\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_q -l \nJOB-ID\n \n|\n condor_ce_job_router_info -match-jobs -ignore-prior-routing -jobads -\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect a job that has already left the queue, use \ncondor_ce_history\n instead of \ncondor_ce_q\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_history -l \nJOB-ID\n \n|\n condor_ce_job_router_info -match-jobs -ignore-prior-routing -jobads -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the proxy for the job has expired, the job will not match any routes. To work around this constraint:\n\n\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_history -l \nJOB-ID\n \n|\n sed \ns/^\\(x509UserProxyExpiration\\) = .*/\\1 = `date +%s --date \n+1 sec\n`/\n \n|\n condor_ce_job_router_info -match-jobs -ignore-prior-routing -jobads -\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can provide a file containing a job\u2019s ClassAd as the input and edit attributes within that file:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_job_router_info -match-jobs -ignore-prior-routing -jobads \nJOBAD-FILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nIf the job does not match any route:\n You can identify this case when you see \n0 candidate jobs found\n in the \ncondor_job_router_info\n output. This message means that, when compared to your job\u2019s ClassAd, the Umbrella constraint does not evaluate to \ntrue\n. When troubleshooting, look at all of the expressions prior to the \ntarget.ProcId \n= 0\n expression, because it and everything following it is logic that the job router added so that routed jobs do not get routed again.\n\n\n\n\nIf your job matches more than one route:\n the tool will tell you by showing all matching routes after the job ID:\n\n\nChecking Job src=162,0 against all routes\nRoute Matches: Local_PBS\nRoute Matches: Condor_Test\n\n\n\n\n\nTo troubleshoot why this is occuring, look at the combined Requirements expressions for all routes and compare it to the job\u2019s ClassAd provided. The combined Requirements expression is \nhighlighted below\n:\n\n\nUmbrella constraint: ((target.x509userproxysubject =!= UNDEFINED) \n\n(target.x509UserProxyExpiration =!= UNDEFINED) \n\n(time() \n target.x509UserProxyExpiration) \n\n(target.JobUniverse =?= 5 || target.JobUniverse =?= 1)) \n\n\n( (target.osgTestPBS is true) || (true) )\n \n\n(target.ProcId \n= 0 \n target.JobStatus == 1 \n\n(target.StageInStart is undefined || target.StageInFinish isnt undefined) \n\ntarget.Managed isnt \nScheddDone\n \n\ntarget.Managed isnt \nExtenal\n \n\ntarget.Owner isnt Undefined \n\ntarget.RoutedBy isnt \nhtcondor-ce\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth routes evaluate to \ntrue\n for the job\u2019s ClassAd because it contained \nosgTestPBS = true\n. Make sure your routes are mutually exclusive, otherwise you may have jobs routed incorrectly! See the \njob route configuration page\n for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it is unclear why jobs are matching a route:\n wrap the route's requirements expression in \ndebug()\n and check the \nJobRouterLog\n for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_router_q\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nIf you have multiple job routes and many jobs, \ncondor_ce_router_q\n is a useful tool to see how jobs are being routed and their statuses:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_router_q\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_router_q\n takes the same options as \ncondor_router_q\n and \ncondor_q\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n\n\ncondor_ce_status\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo see the daemons running on a CE, you can run the following:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_status -any -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n  with the hostname of the CE.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you run the \ncondor_ce_status\n command on the CE that you are testing, omit the \n-name\n and \n-pool\n options. \ncondor_ce_status\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_status\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nTo list the daemons that are configured to run:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val -v DAEMON_LIST\n\nDAEMON_LIST: MASTER COLLECTOR SCHEDD JOB_ROUTER, SHARED_PORT, SHARED_PORT\n\n\n  Defined in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/03-ce-shared-port.conf\n, line 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not see these daemons in the output of \ncondor_ce_status\n, check the \nMaster log\n for errors.\n\n\ncondor_ce_config_val\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo see the value of configuration variables and where they are set, use \ncondor_ce_config_val\n. Primarily, This tool is used with the other troubleshooting tools to make sure your configuration is set properly. To see the value of a single variable and where it is set:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val -v \nCONFIGURATION-VARIABLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see a list of all configuration variables and their values:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val -dump\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see a list of all the files that are used to create your configuration and the order that they are parsed, use the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val -config\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_config_val\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_config_val\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\ncondor_ce_reconfig\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo ensure that your configuration changes have taken effect, run \ncondor_ce_reconfig\n.\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_{on,off,restart}\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo turn on/off/restart HTCondor-CE daemons, use the following commands:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_on\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_off\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_restart\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE service uses the previous commands with default values. Using these commands directly gives you more fine-grained control over the behavior of HTCondor-CE's on/off/restart:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have installed a new version of HTCondor-CE and want to restart the CE under the new version, run the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_restart -fast\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will cause HTCondor-CE to restart and quickly reconnect to all running jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to stop running new jobs, run the following:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_off -peaceful\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will cause HTCondor-CE to accept new jobs without starting them and will wait for currently running jobs to complete before shutting down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE Troubleshooting Data\n\n\nThe following files are located on the CE host.\n\n\nMasterLog\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE master log tracks status of all of the other HTCondor daemons and thus contains valuable information if they fail to start.\n\n\n\n\nLocation: \n/var/log/condor-ce/MasterLog\n\n\nKey contents: Start-up, shut-down, and communication with other HTCondor daemons\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing the debug level:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the following value in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n on the CE host:\n\n\nMASTER_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo apply these changes, reconfigure HTCondor-CE:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to look for:\n\n\nSuccessful daemon start-up.

            "text": "Submitting Jobs to an HTCondor-CE\n\n\nThis document outlines methods of manual submission to an HTCondor-CE. It is intended for site administrators wishing to verify the functionality of their HTCondor-CE installation and developers writing software to submit jobs to an HTCondor-CE (e.g., pilot jobs).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nMost incoming jobs are pilots from factories and that manual submission does not reflect the standard method that jobs are submitted to OSG CE\u2019s.\n\n\n\n\nSubmitting Jobs...\n\n\nThere are two main methods for submitting files to an HTCondor-CE: using the tools bundled with the \nhtcondor-ce-client\n package and using the \ncondor_submit\n command with a submit file. Both methods will test end-to-end job submission but the former method is simpler while the latter will walk you through writing your own submit file.\n\n\nBefore attempting to submit jobs, you will need to generate a proxy from a user certificate before running any jobs. To generate a proxy, run the following command on the host you plan on submitting from:\n\n\nuser@host $\n voms-proxy-init\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing HTCondor-CE tools\n\n\nThere are two HTCondor-CE tools that allow users to test the functionality of their HTCondor-CE: \ncondor_ce_trace\n and \ncondor_ce_run\n. The former is the preferred tool as it provides useful feedback if failure occurs while the latter is simply an automated submission tool. These commands may be run from any host that has \nhtcondor-ce-client\n installed, which you may wish to do if you are testing availability of your CE from an external source.\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n is a Python script that uses HTCondor's Python bindings to run diagnostics, including job submission, against your HTCondor-CE. To submit a job with \ncondor_ce_trace\n, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_trace --debug condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE you wish to test. On success, you will see \nJob status: Completed\n and the environment of the job on the worker node it landed on. If you do not get the expected output, refer to the \ntroubleshooting guide\n.\n\n\nRequesting resources\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n doesn't make any specific resource requests so its jobs are only given the default resources by the CE. To request specific resources (or other job attributes), you can specify the \n--attribute\n option on the command line:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_trace --debug --attribute\n=\n+resource1=value1\n...--attribute\n=\n+resourceN=valueN\n condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nTo submit a job that requests 4 cores, 4 GB of RAM, a wall clock time of 2 hours, and the 'osg' queue, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_trace --debug --attribute\n=\n+xcount=4\n --attribute\n=\n+maxMemory=4000\n --attribute\n=\n+maxWallTime=120\n --attribute\n=\n+remote_queue=osg\n condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a list of other attributes that can be set with the \n--attribute\n option, consult the \njob attributes\n section.\n\n\ncondor_ce_run\n\n\ncondor_ce_run\n is a Python script that calls \ncondor_submit\n on a generated submit file and tracks its progress with \ncondor_q\n. To submit a job with \ncondor_ce_run\n, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_run -r condorce.example.com:9619 /bin/env\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE you wish to test. The command will not return any output until it completes: When it does you will see the environment of the job on the worker noded it landed on. If you do not get the expected output, refer to the \ntroubleshooting guide\n.\n\n\nUsing a submit file...\n\n\nIf you are familiar with HTCondor, submitting a job to an HTCondor-CE using a submit file follows the same procedure as submitting a job to an HTCondor batch system: Write a submit file and use \ncondor_submit\n (or in one of our cases, \ncondor_ce_submit\n) to submit the job. This is by virtue of the fact that HTCondor-CE is just a special configuration of HTCondor. The major differences occur in the specific attributes for the submit files outlined below.\n\n\nFrom the CE host\n\n\nThis method uses \ncondor_ce_submit\n to submit directly to an HTCondor-CE. The only reason we use \ncondor_ce_submit\n in this case is to take advantage of the already running daemons on the CE host.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a submit file, \nce_test.sub\n:\n\n\n# Required for local HTCondor-CE submission\nuniverse = vanilla\nuse_x509userproxy = true\n+Owner = undefined\n\n# Files\nexecutable = \nce_test.sh\n\noutput = ce_test.out\nerror = ce_test.err\nlog = ce_test.log\n\n# File transfer behavior\nShouldTransferFiles = YES\nWhenToTransferOutput = ON_EXIT\n\n# Optional resource requests\n#+xcount = 4            # Request 4 cores\n#+maxMemory = 4000      # Request 4GB of RAM\n#+maxWallTime = 120     # Request 2 hrs of wall clock time\n#+remote_queue = \nosg\n  # Request the OSG queue\n\n# Run job once\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \nce_test.sh\n with the path to the executable you wish to run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use any executable you choose for the \nexecutable\n field.

It does this by checking the routes \nRequirements\n expression against the job and selecting the first match. If your job does not match any routes, the job will be put on hold and eventually removed from the CE queue without completing.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor versions of HTCondor \n 8.7.1, the JobRouter matches jobs to routes in a round-robin fashion. This means that if a job can match to multiple routes, it can be routed by any of them! So when writing job routes, make sure that they are exclusive to each other and that your jobs can only match to a single route.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nThe following three routes only perform filtering and submission of routed jobs to an HTCondor batch system. The only differences are in the types of jobs that they match:\n\n\n\n\nRoute 1:\n Matches jobs whose attribute \nfoo\n is equal to \nbar\n.\n\n\nRoute 2:\n Matches jobs whose attribute \nfoo\n is equal to \nbaz\n.\n\n\nRoute 3:\n Matches jobs whose attribute \nfoo\n is neither equal to \nbar\n nor \nbaz\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSetting a custom attribute for job submission requires the \n+\n prefix in your submit file but it is unnecessary in the job routes.\n\n\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nRoute 1\n; \\\n     Requirements = (TARGET.foo =?= \nbar\n); \\\n] \\\n[ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nRoute 2\n; \\\n     Requirements = (TARGET.foo =?= \nbaz\n); \\\n] \\\n[ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nRoute 3\n; \\\n     Requirements = (TARGET.foo =!= \nbar\n) \n (TARGET.foo =!= \nbaz\n); \\\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a user could submitted their job with \n+foo=bar\n, the job would match \nRoute 1\n.\n\n\nRoute defaults\n\n\nRoute defaults\n can be set for batch system queue, maximum memory, number of cores to request, and maximum walltime. The submitting user can override any of these by setting the corresponding \nattribute\n in their job.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nThe following route takes all incoming jobs and submits them to an HTCondor batch system requesting 1GB of memory.\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nRoute 1\n; \\\n     set_default_maxMemory = 1000; \\\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nA user could submit their job with the attribute \n+maxMemory=2000\n and that job would be submitted requesting 2GB memory instead of the default of 1GB.\n\n\nTroubleshooting Your Jobs\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nAll interactions between \ncondor_submit\n and the CE will be recorded in the file specified by the \nlog\n attribute in your submit file.

Below is a sample configuration, but please note\nthat you will need to \nedit the parts in \nred\n. In\nparticular, the \nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY\n line below must be edited for your\nsite.\n\n\nCVMFS_REPOSITORIES=\n`echo $((echo oasis.opensciencegrid.org;echo cms.cern.ch;ls /cvmfs)|sort -u)|tr \n \n ,`\n\nCVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT=\n20000\n\nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=\nhttp://squid.example.com:3128\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCVMFS by default allows any repository to be mounted, no matter what\nthe setting of \nCVMFS_REPOSITORIES\n is; that variable is used by support\ntools such as \ncvmfs_config\n and \ncvmfs_talk\n when they need to know a\nlist of repositories.  The recommended \nCVMFS_REPOSITORIES\n setting\nabove is so that those tools will use two common repositories plus any\nadditional that have been mounted.

Note\nthat an additional 1000 MB is allocated for a separate osgstorage.org\nrepositories cache in \n$CVMFS_CACHE_BASE/osgstorage\n. To be safe, make\nsure that at least 20% more than \n$CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT\n + 1000 MB of space\nstays available for CVMFS in that filesystem. This is very important,\nsince if that space is not available it can cause many I/O errors and\napplication crashes. Many system administrators choose to put the\ncache space in a separate filesystem, which is a good way to manage\nit.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you use SELinux and change \nCVMFS_CACHE_BASE\n, then the\nnew cache directory must be labelled with SELinux type\n\ncvmfs_cache_t\n.

It is used by grid pilot jobs (which are\nsubmitted by per-VO grid workload management systems) to isolate user\njobs from the pilot's files and processes and from other users' files\nand processes.  It also supplies a chroot environment in order to run\nuser jobs in different operating system images under one Linux kernel.\n\n\nFor operating system kernels older than the one released for\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.4,\nsingularity needs to use kernel capabilities that are only accessible\nto the root user, so it has to be installed with setuid-root\nexecutables.  Securing setuid-root programs is difficult, but singularity\nkeeps that privileged code to a\n\nminimum\n to keep the\nvulnerability low.\n\n\nBeginning with the kernel released with RHEL 7.4, there is a new\n\ntechnology preview feature\n\nto allow unprivileged bind mounts in user namespaces, which allows\nsingularity to run as an unprivileged user.  The OSG has installed\nsingularity in \ncvmfs\n, so  you can avoid installing\nsingularity at all.

It is used by grid pilot jobs (which are\nsubmitted by per-VO grid workload management systems) to isolate user\njobs from the pilot's files and processes and from other users' files\nand processes.  It also supplies a chroot environment in order to run\nuser jobs in different operating system images under one Linux kernel.  For operating system kernels older than the one released for\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.4,\nsingularity needs to use kernel capabilities that are only accessible\nto the root user, so it has to be installed with setuid-root\nexecutables.  Securing setuid-root programs is difficult, but singularity\nkeeps that privileged code to a minimum  to keep the\nvulnerability low.  Beginning with the kernel released with RHEL 7.4, there is a new technology preview feature \nto allow unprivileged bind mounts in user namespaces, which allows\nsingularity to run as an unprivileged user.  The OSG has installed\nsingularity in  cvmfs , so  you can avoid installing\nsingularity at all.

            "text": "Install an OASIS Repository\n\n\nOASIS (the \nOSG\n \nA\npplication \nS\noftware \nI\nnstallation \nS\nervice) is an infrastructure, based on\n\nCVMFS\n, for distributing software throughout the OSG.  Once software is installed into\nan OASIS repository, the goal is to make it available across about 90% of the OSG within an hour.\n\n\nOASIS consists of keysigning infrastructure, a content distribution network (CDN), and a shared CVMFS repository that\nis hosted by the OSG.  Many use cases will be covered by utilizing the \nshared repository\n; this document\ncovers how to install, configure, and host your own CVMFS \nrepository server\n.  This server will distribute software\nvia OASIS, but will be hosted and operated externally from the OSG project.\n\n\nOASIS-based distribution and key signing is available to OSG VOs or repositories affiliated with an OSG VO.\nSee the \npolicy page\n for more information\non what repositories OSG is willing to distribute.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nCVMFS repositories work at the kernel filesystem layer, which adds more stringent host requirements than a typical\nOSG install.  The host OS must meet ONE of the following:\n\n\n\n\nRHEL 7.3 (or equivalent) or later.  \nThis option is recommended\n.\n\n\nRHEL 6 with the aufs kernel module.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally,\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If it does not exist already, the installation will create the \ncvmfs\n Linux user\n\n\nGroup IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux groups \ncvmfs\n and \nfuse\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n This page will configure the repository to distribute using Apache HTTPD on port 8000.  At the\n    minimum, the repository needs in-bound access from the OASIS CDN.\n\n\nDisk space:\n This host will need enough free disk space to host \ntwo\n copies of the software: one compressed\n    and one uncompressed. \n/srv/cvmfs\n will hold all the published data (compressed and de-deuplicated).  The\n    \n/var/spool/cvmfs\n directory will contain all the data in all current transactions (uncompressed).\n\n\nRoot access\n will be needed to install.  Software install will be done as an unprivileged user.\n\n\nYum\n will need to be \nconfigured to use the OSG repositories\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverlay-FS limitations\n\n\nCVMFS on RHEL7 only supports Overlay-FS if the underlying filesystem is \next3\n or \next4\n; make sure\n\n/var/spool/cvmfs\n is one of these filesystem types.\n\n\nIf this is not possible, add \nCVMFS_DONT_CHECK_OVERLAYFS_VERSION=yes\n to your CVMFS configuration.  Using\n\nxfs\n will work if it was created with \nftype=1\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nRHEL7-based Systems\n\n\nFor a RHEL7-based system, installation is a straightforward install via \nyum\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install cvmfs-server osg-oasis \n\n\n\n\n\nRHEL6-based Systems\n\n\nA RHEL6 host needs additional steps in order to add the AUFS2 kernel module.\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -i https://cvmrepo.web.cern.ch/cvmrepo/yum/cvmfs-release-latest.noarch.rpm\n\nroot@host #\n yum install --enablerepo\n=\ncernvm-kernel --disablerepo\n=\ncernvm kernel aufs2-util cvmfs-server.x86_64 osg-oasis\n\nroot@host #\n reboot\n\n\n\n\n\nApache and Repository Mounts\n\n\nFor all installs, we recommend mounting all the local repositories on startup:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n \ncvmfs_server mount -a\n \n/etc/rc.local\n\nroot@host #\n chmod +x /etc/rc.local\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Apache HTTPD service should be configured to listen on port 8000, have the \nKeepAlive\n option enabled, and be\nstarted:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n Listen \n8000\n \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf \n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n KeepAlive on \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf \n\nroot@host #\n chkconfig httpd on \n\nroot@host #\n service httpd start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Firewalls\n\n\nMake sure that port 8000 is available to the Internet.  Check the setting of the host- and site-level firewalls.\nThe next steps will fail if the web server is not accessible.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Repository\n\n\nPrior to creation, the repository administrator will need to make two decisions:\n\n\n\n\nSelect a repository name\n; typically, this is derived from the VO or project's name and ends in\n    \nopensciencegrid.org\n.  For example, the NoVA VO runs the repository \nnova.opensciencegrid.org\n.  For this section,\n    we will use \nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n.\n\n\nSelect a repository owner\n: Software publication will need to run by a non-\nroot\n Unix user account; for this\n    document, we will use \nLIBRARIAN\n as the account name of the repository owner.\n\n\n\n\nThe initial repository creation must be run as \nroot\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n -e \n\\*\\\\t\\\\t-\\\\tnofile\\\\t\\\\t16384\n \n/etc/security/limits.conf\n\nroot@host #\n \nulimit\n -n \n16384\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server mkfs -o \nLIBRARIAN\n \nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n \nCVMFS_AUTO_TAG=false\n \n/etc/cvmfs/repositories.d/\nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n/server.conf\n\nroot@host #\n \n(\necho\n Order deny,allow\n;\necho\n Deny from all\n;\necho\n Allow from \n127\n.0.0.1\n;\necho\n Allow from ::1\n;\necho\n Allow from \n129\n.79.53.0/24\n;\necho\n Allow from \n2001\n:18e8:2:6::/56\n)\n \n/srv/cvmfs/\nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n/.htaccess\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we increase the number of open files, create the repository using the \nmkfs\n command, adjust the configuration,\nand then limit the hosts that are allowed to access the repo to the OSG CDN.\n\n\n\n\nHardlink Limitations on EL6\n\n\nIf you might be hosting any hardlinks that span directories (e.g. publishing a \ngit\n repository) and are using\nEL6 with aufs, make the following configuration change:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n \nCVMFS_IGNORE_XDIR_HARDLINKS=true\n \n/etc/cvmfs/repositories.d/repo.domain.name/server.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the repository is readable over HTTP:\n\n\nroot@host #\n wget -qO- http://localhost:8000/cvmfs/\nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n/.cvmfswhitelist \n|\n cat -v\n\n\n\n\n\nThat should print several lines including some gibberish at the end.\n\n\nHost a Repository on OASIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify your VO's OIM registration is up-to-date\n.  All repositories need to be associated with a VO; the VO\n    needs to assign an \nOASIS manager\n in OIM who would be responsible for the contents of any of the VO's repositories\n    and will be contacted in case of issues. To designate an OASIS manager, have the VO manager update the\n    \nOIM registration\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe repository administrator should \ncreate a \nsupport ticket\n\n    using the following template:\n\n\nPlease add a new CVMFS repository to OASIS for VO \nvoname\n using the URL \n    http://\nfully.qualified.domain\n:8000/cvmfs/\nexample.opensciencegrid.org\n\nby doing step #3 at\n    https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/data/external-oasis-repos\nThe VO responsible manager will be \nOASIS Manager Name\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace the \nred\n items with the appropriate values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nOSG internal step\n)\n    OSG Operations ensures that the repository administrator is valid for the VO. This can be done by (a) OSG\n    already having a relationship with the person or (b) the GOC representative contacting the VO manager to find out.\n    OSG Operations should review the URL to verify it is appropriate for the VO.  This typically takes one business day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nOSG internal step\n)\n    The OSG representative adds the repository URL in OIM under the VO's OASIS repository URLs.

A stand-alone GridFTP server might be used under the following circumstances:\n\n\n\n\nYou are serving VOs that use storage heavily (CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0) and your site has more than 250 cores\n\n\nYour site will be managing more than 50 TB of disk space\n\n\nA simple front-end to a filesystem allowing access over WAN - for example NFS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis document is for a standalone GridFTP server on top of POSIX storage.

Of these, GUMS has the most features and capabilities. The LCMAPS VOMS plugin is the new OSG-preferred authentication, offering the simplicity of edg-mkgridmap and many of GUMS' rich feature set. If you need to support \"\npool accounts\n\", GUMS is the only option with that capability.\n\n\nIn OSG 3.4, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin is the only available authentication solution.\n\n\nAuthentication with the LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following line to \n/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server\n:\n\n\nexport\n \nLLGT_VOMS_ENABLE_CREDENTIAL_CHECK\n=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis should \nonly\n be done for OSG 3.3; it is unnecessary for OSG 3.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the instructions in \nthe LCMAPS VOMS plugin installation and configuration document\n to prepare the LCMAPS VOMS plugin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis is the suggested mechanism for all new installs.\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication with edg-mkgridmap\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nAs of the June 2017 release of OSG 3.4.0, this software is officially deprecated.

You need to enable the probe first. To do this, edit \n/etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig\n to set:\n\n\nEnableProbe=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll other configuration settings should be suitable for most purposes. However, you can edit them if needed. The probe runs every 30 minutes as a cron job.\n\n\nOptional configuration\n\n\nModifying the environment\n\n\nEnvironment variables are stored in \n/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server\n which is sourced on service startup.  If you want to change LCMAPS log levels, or GridFTP port ranges, you can edit them there.\n\n\n#Uncomment and modify for firewalls\n\n\n#export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=min,max\n\n\n#export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=min,max\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the variables \nGLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE\n and \nGLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE\n can be set here to allow GridFTP to navigate around firewall rules (these affect the inbound and outbound ports, respectively).\n\n\nTo troubleshoot LCMAPS authorization, you can add the following to \n/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server\n and choose a higher debug level:\n\n\n# level 0: no messages, 1: errors, 2: also warnings, 3: also notices,\n#  4: also info, 5: maximum debug\nLCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL=2\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput goes to \n/var/log/messages\n by default. Do not set logging to 5 on any production systems as that may cause systems to slow down significantly or become unresponsive.\n\n\nConfiguring a multi-homed server\n\n\nThe GridFTP uses control connections, data connections and IPC connections. By default it listens in all interfaces but this can be changed by editing the configuration file \n/etc/gridftp.conf\n.\n\n\nTo use a single interface you can set \nhostname\n to the Hostname or IP address to use:\n\n\nhostname IP-TO-USE\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also set separately the \ncontrol_interface\n, \ndata_interface\n and \nipc_interface\n.  On systems that have multiple network interfaces, you may want to associate data transfers with the fastest possible NIC available. This can be done in the GridFTP server by setting \ndata_interface\n:\n\n\ncontrol_interface IP-TO-USE\ndata_interface IP-TO-USE\nipc_interface IP-TO-USE\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more options available for the GridFTP server, read the comments in the configuration file (\n/etc/gridftp.conf\n) or see the \nGlobus manual\n.\n\n\nManaging GridFTP\n\n\nIn addition to the GridFTP service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation.

            "text": "Load Balancing GridFTP\n\n\nGridFTP is designed for high throughput data transfers and in many cases can handle all of the transfers for a site. However, in some cases it may be useful to run multiple GridFTP servers to distribute the load. For such sites, we recommend using a \nload balancer\n to distribute requests and present the appearance of a single high-throughput GridFTP server.\n\n\nOne general-purpose technology for implementing a load balancer on Linux is \nLinux Virtual Server\n (LVS). To use it with GridFTP, a single load balancer listens on a virtual IP address, monitors the health of the set of real GridFTP servers, and forwards requests to available ones. Optionally, there can be one or more inactive, backup load balancers that can activate and take over the virtual IP address in case the primary load balancer fails, resulting in a system that is more resilient to failure. LVS is implemented by the \nIP Virtual Server\n kernel module, which can be managed by userspace services on the load balancers such as \nkeepalived\n.\n\n\nThis guide explains how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot the \nkeepalived\n service on a load balancing host for a set of \nGridFTP\n servers.\n\n\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\nYou must have \ngrid administrator privileges\n\n\nThere must be a shared file system for file propagation across GridFTP servers\n\n\nYou must have reserved a virtual IP address and associated virtual hostname\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to each host\n\n\n\n\nDesigning Your Load-Balanced GridFTP System\n\n\nBefore beginning the installation process, you will need to plan the overall architecture of your load-balanced GridFTP system: the number of GridFTP servers, the type of shared file system to run on the GridFTP servers, whether or not backup load balancers are required, and hardware requirements.\n\n\nGridFTP servers\n\n\nThe number of GridFTP servers that you should run is determined first and foremost by the expected GridFTP transfer load at your site and the speed of the links available to each server. For example, if you expect a 20Gbps peak transfer load and have 10Gb links with 80\u201390% efficiency, you would need a minimum of 4 GridFTP servers: 3 to satisfy your desired throughput + 1 for failover or growth.\n\n\nShared file system\n\n\nThe number of GridFTP servers can also be determined by your hardware needs, which are determined by your choice of shared file system. If you choose a POSIX-based shared file system, plan for machines with more cores, or more GridFTP hosts to distribute the CPU load. If you are running \nGridFTP with Hadoop\n, plan for machines with more memory, or more GridFTP hosts to distribute the memory load.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you determine that you need only a single GridFTP host, you do not need load balancing. Instead, follow the \nstandalone-GridFTP installation guide\n.\n\n\n\n\nLoad balancer(s)\n\n\nIn the recommended direct routing mode, load balancers simply rewrite initial packets from a given request so the hardware requirements are minimal. When choosing load balancer hosts, aim for stability. If your chosen host is unstable or if you do not want to introduce downtime for operating system or hardware updates, one additional load balancer as a backup should be sufficient.\n\n\nPreparing the GridFTP Servers\n\n\nBefore adding your GridFTP hosts to the load-balanced system, each host requires the GridFTP software, special certificates, and load-balancing configuration.\n\n\nAcquiring service certificate(s)\n\n\nWhen authenticating with a GridFTP server, clients verify that the server's host certificate matches the hostname of the server.

            "text": "GridFTP is designed for high throughput data transfers and in many cases can handle all of the transfers for a site. However, in some cases it may be useful to run multiple GridFTP servers to distribute the load. For such sites, we recommend using a  load balancer  to distribute requests and present the appearance of a single high-throughput GridFTP server.  One general-purpose technology for implementing a load balancer on Linux is  Linux Virtual Server  (LVS). To use it with GridFTP, a single load balancer listens on a virtual IP address, monitors the health of the set of real GridFTP servers, and forwards requests to available ones. Optionally, there can be one or more inactive, backup load balancers that can activate and take over the virtual IP address in case the primary load balancer fails, resulting in a system that is more resilient to failure. LVS is implemented by the  IP Virtual Server  kernel module, which can be managed by userspace services on the load balancers such as  keepalived .  This guide explains how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot the  keepalived  service on a load balancing host for a set of  GridFTP  servers.   Before starting the installation process, consider the following requirements:   You must have  grid administrator privileges  There must be a shared file system for file propagation across GridFTP servers  You must have reserved a virtual IP address and associated virtual hostname   As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:   Ensure the host has  a supported operating system  Obtain root access to each host",

            "text": "Hadoop Overview\n\n\nHadoop Introduction\n\n\nHadoop is a data processing framework. It is an open-source Apache Foundation project, and the main contributor is Yahoo! The framework has two main parts - job scheduling and a distributed file system, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). We currently utilize HDFS as a general-purpose file system. For this document, we'll use the words \"Hadoop\" and \"HDFS\" interchangeably, but it's nice to know the distinction.\n\n\nWe recommend starting with \nHDFS architecture document\n.\n\n\nPlease do read through this. We will assume you have read this, or at least the important architectural portions. The file system is block-oriented; each file is broken up into 64 MB or 128 MB chunks (user configurable). These chunks are stored on data nodes and served up from there; the central namenode keeps track of the block locations, the namespace information, and block placement policies. HDFS provides POSIX-like semantics; it provides fully random-access reads and non-random-access writes. Currently, fsync and appends (after the file has been initially closed) are experimental and not available to OSG-based installs.\n\n\nHadoop SE Components\n\n\nWe broadly break down the server components of the Hadoop SE into three categories: HDFS core, Grid extensions, and HDFS auxiliary. The components in each of these categories are outlined below:\n\n\n\n\nHDFS Core:\n\n\nNamenode: The core metadata server of Hadoop. This is the most critical piece of the system, and there can only be one of these. This stores both the file system image and the file system journal. The namenode keeps all of the filesystem layout information (files, blocks, directories, permissions, etc) and the block locations. The filesystem layout is persisted on disk and the block locations are kept solely in memory. When a client opens a file, the namenode tells the client the locations of all the blocks in the file; the client then no longer needs to communicate with the namenode for data transfer.\n\n\nDatanode: This node stores copies of the blocks in HDFS. They communicate with the namenode to perform \"housekeeping\" such as creating new replicas, transferring blocks between datanodes, and deleting excess blocks. They also communicate with the clients to transfer data. To reach the best scalability, there should be as many datanodes as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrid extensions\n\n\nBeStMan SRM: A generic SRM server that can be run on top of any POSIX-like filesystem. This is run in \"gateway\" mode, which limits the amount of the SRM protocol implemented. To date, this has been sufficient to LHC VOs.\n\n\nGlobus GridFTP: The standard GridFTP from Globus. We use a plug-in module (using the Globus Direct Storage Interface) that allows the GridFTP process to use the HDFS C-bindings directly.\n\n\nGratia probe: Gratia is an accounting system that records batch system and transfer records to a database. The records are collected by a client program called a \"probe\" which runs on the GridFTP server. It parses the GridFTP server's log files and creates transfer records.\n\n\nXrootd server plugin: Xrootd is an extremely flexible and powerful data server popular in the high energy physics community. There exists a HDFS plugin for Xrootd; integrating with Xrootd provides a means to export HDFS securely outside the local cluster, as another Xrootd plugin provides GSI-based authentication and authorization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS auxiliary:\n\n\n\"Secondary Namenode\": Perhaps more aptly called a \"checkpoint server\". This server downloads the file system image and journal from the namenode, merges the two together, and uploads the new file system image up to the namenode. This is done on a different server in order to reduce the memory footprint of the namenode.\n\n\nHadoop Balancer: This is a script (unlike the others, which are daemons) that runs on the namenode. It requests transfers of random blocks between the datanodes. This works until all datanodes have approximately the same percentage of free space. Well-balanced datanodes are necessary for having a healthy cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the server components, there are two client components:\n\n\n\n\nFUSE: This allows HDFS to be mounted as a filesystem on the worker nodes. FUSE is a Linux kernel module that allows kernel I/O calls to be translated into a call to a userspace program. In this case, a program called fuse_dfs translates the POSIX calls into HDFS C-binding calls.\n\n\nHadoop Command Line Client: This command line client exposes a lot of the Unix-like calls without mounting FUSE, plus access to the non-POSIX calls (such as setting quotas and file replication levels). For example, \"hadoop fs -ls /\" is equivalent to \"ls /mnt/hadoop\" if /mnt/hadoop is the mount point of HDFS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamenode: We recommend at least 8GB of RAM (minimum is 2GB RAM), preferably 16GB or more. A rough rule of thumb is 1GB per 100TB of raw disk space; the actual requirements is around 1GB per million objects (files, directories, and blocks). The CPU requirements are any modern multi-core server CPU. Typically, the namenode will only use 2-5% of your CPU.\n\n\nAs this is a single point of failure, the \nmost important\n requirement is reliable hardware rather than high performance hardware. We suggest a node with redundant power supplies and at least 2 hard drives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary namenode: This node needs the same amount of RAM as the namenode for merging namespaces. It does not need to be high performance or high reliability.\n\n\nDatanode: Each datanode should plan to dedicate 200-500MB of RAM to HDFS. A general rule of thumb is to dedicate 1 CPU to HDFS per 5TB of disk capacity under heavily load; clusters with moderate load (i.e., mostly sequential workflows) will need less. At idle, HDFS will consume almost no CPU.\n\n\n\n\nMinimal Installation (0-50TB, WAN transfers up to 1Gbps)\n\n\nThe minimal installation would involve 5 nodes:\n\n\n1 hadoop-name: The namenode for the Hadoop system. Must be on private NAT. 1 hadoop-name2: This will run the HDFS secondary namenode. Must also be on private NAT. 1 hadoop-data1, hadoop-data2: Two HDFS datanodes. They will hold data for the system, so they should have sizable hard drives. These must be on the private NAT. As the Hadoop installation grows to many terabytes, this will be the only class of nodes one adds. 1 hadoop-grid: Runs the BeStMan SRM and Globus GridFTP server. Must have a public interface and a private interface.\n\n\nIf desired, hadoop-name and hadoop-name2 may be virtualized. Prior to installation, DNS / host name resolution \nmust\n work. That is, you should be able to resolve all the hadoop servers either through DNS or /etc/hosts. Because of the grid software, hadoop-grid \nmust\n have reverse DNS working.\n\n\nMedium Installation (50-150TB, WAN transfers up to 2 Gbps)\n\n\nFor a medium install, make the following changes over the minimal install: 1 Run BeStMan on a separate machine, hadoop-srm. This host may be virtualized. 1 Run multiple GridFTP servers (2 should be fine); if possible, use 10 Gbps cards for these hosts. 1 Add many more HDFS datanodes. This usually means starting to add 1 or 2 TB hard drives to some worker nodes.\n\n\nLarge Installation (\n150TB, WAN transfers over 2 Gbps)\n\n\nFor a large installation, make the following changes: 1 Run more GridFTP servers; plan for 800 Mbps per host with 1 Gbps card in order to have excess capacity. 1 Purchase machines suitable for HDFS datanodes. It is possible to get a 2U box with 8-12 hard drives; for many projects, this will provide a more suitable CPU to disk ratio than the 1U boxes with 2 hard drives.\n\n\nHadoop Security\n\n\nHDFS has unix-like user/group authorization, but no strict authentication. HDFS should only be exposed to a secure internal network which only non-malicious users are able to access. For users with access to the local cluster, it is not difficult at all to bypass authentication.\n\n\nThe default ports are listed here\n.\n\n\nThere are some ways to improve security of your cluster:\n\n\n\n\nKeep the namenode behind a firewall. One possibility is to run hadoop entirely on the private subnet of a cluster.\n\n\nUse firewalls to protect the HDFS ports (default for the datanode is 50010 and 50075; for the namenode, 50070 and 9000).\n\n\nFor clusters utilizing FUSE, one can block outgoing connections to the HDFS ports except for user root. This means that only root-owned processes (such as FUSE-DFS) will be able to access Hadoop.\n\n\nThis is sufficient for grid environments, but does not protect one in the case where the attacker has physical access to the network switch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere exists another option, currently untested. It is possible to limit all HDFS socket connections to SSL-based sockets. Using this to only allow known hosts to connect to HDFS and only allowing FUSE-DFS to connect on those known hosts, one might be able to satisfy even fairly stringent security folks (but not paranoid ones).\n\n\n\n\nThere are three options to export your data outside your cluster:\n\n\n\n\nGlobus GridFTP / SRM. This is covered in these web pages.\n\n\nXrootd. Documentation is nascent.\n\n\nApache HTTP (authenticated via HTTPS). This is in use at Caltech, but there isn't any documentation available.",

It is based on map-reduce framework and design of the Google file system. The VDT distribution of Hadoop includes all components needed to operate a multi-terabyte storage site. Included are:\n\n\n\n\nAn \nSRM interface\n for grid access;\n\n\nGridFTP-HDFS as transport layer; and\n\n\nA \nFUSE interface\n for localized POSIX access.\n\n\nApache Hadoop\n\n\n\n\nThe OSG packaging and distribution of Hadoop is based on YUM. All components are packaged as RPMs and are available from the OSG repositories. It is also recommended that you enable \nEPEL\n repos.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere are several important components to a storage element installation. Throughout this document, it will be stated which node the relevant installation instructions apply to. It can apply to one of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamenode\n: You will have at least one namenode. The name node functions as the directory server and coordinator of the hadoop cluster. It houses all the meta-data for the hadoop cluster. \nThe namenode and secondary namenode need to have a directory that they can both access on a shared filesystem so that they can exchange filesystem checkpoints.\n\n\nSecondary Namenode\n: This is a secondary machine that periodically merges updates to the HDFS file system back into the fsimage. This dramatically improves startup and restart times.\n\n\nDatanode\n: You will have many datanodes. Each data node stores large blocks of files to be stored on the hadoop cluster.\n\n\nClient\n: This is a documentation shorthand that refers to any machine with the hadoop client commands and \nFUSE\n mount. Any machine that needs a FUSE mount to access data in a POSIX-like fashion will need this.\n\n\nGridFTP node\n: This is a node with \nGlobus GridFTP\n. The GridFTP server for Hadoop can be very memory-hungry, up to 500MB/transfer in the default configuration. You should plan accordingly to provision enough GridFTP servers to handle the bandwidth that your site can support.\n\n\nSRM node\n: This node will contain the BeStMan SRM frontend for accessing the Hadoop cluster via the SRM protocol. \nBeStMan2 SRM\n\n\n\n\nNote that these components are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For instance, you may consider having your GridFTP server co-located on the SRM node. Alternatively, you can locate a client (or even a GridFTP node) co-located on each data node. That way, each data node also acts as an access point to the hadoop cluster.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nTotal installation time, on an average, should not exceed 8 to 24 man-hours. If your site needs further assistance to help expedite, please email \n.\n\n\n\n\nHost and OS\n\n\nHadoop will run anywhere that Java is supported (including Solaris). However, these instructions are for RedHat derivants (including Scientific Linux) because of the RPM based installation. The current supported Operating Systems supported by the OSG are Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and variants (see \ndetails...\n).\n\n\nThe HDFS prerequisites are:\n\n\n\n\nMinimum of 1 headnode (the namenode)\n\n\nAt least one node which will hold data, preferably at least 2. Most sites will have 20 to 200 datanodes.\n\n\nWorking Yum and RPM installation on every system.\n\n\nfuse\n kernel module and \nfuse-libs\n.\n\n\nJava RPM. If java isn't already installed we supply the Oracle jdk 1.6.0 rpm and it will come in as a dependency. Oracle jdk is currently the only jdk supported by OSG so we highly recommend you use the version supplied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nVersions of OpenAFS less than 1.4.7 and greater than 1.4.1 create nameless groups on Linux; these groups confuse Hadoop and prevent its components from starting up successfully. If you plan to install Hadoop on a Linux OpenAFS client, make sure you're running at least OpenAFS 1.4.7.\n\n\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nThis installation will create following users unless they are already created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbestman\n\n\nUsed by Bestman SRM server (needs sudo access).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhdfs\n\n\nUsed by Hadoop to store data blocks and meta-data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this package to function correctly, you will have to create the users needed for grid operation. Any user that can be authenticated should be created.\n\n\nFor grid-mapfile users, each line of the grid-mapfile is a certificate/user pair. Each user in this file should be created on the server.\n\n\nFor gums users, this means that each user that can be authenticated by gums should be created on the server.\n\n\nNote that these users must be kept in sync with the authentication method. For instance, if new users or rules are added in gums, then new users should also be added here.\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\n\nUser that owns certificate\n\n\nPath to certificate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost certificate\n\n\nroot\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n \n \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBestman service certificate\n\n\nbestman\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmancert.pem\n \n \n/etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmankey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n to request a service certificate.\n\n\nYou will also need a copy of CA certificates (see below). Note that the \nosg-se-hadoop-srm\n and \nosg-se-hadoop-gridftp\n package will automatically install a certificate package but will not necessarily pick the cert package you expect. For instance, certain installs will prefer the \nosg-ca-scripts\n package to fulfill this requirement, which installs a set of scripts to automatically update the certificates, but does not initialize the CA certs by default (you have to run it first). For this reason, you may want to specifically install the cert package of your choice first, before installing Hadoop.\n\n\nNetworking\n\n\nInitializing Certificate Authority\n\n\nThis is needed by GridFTP and SRM nodes, but it is recommended for all nodes in the cluster. Enable \nfetch-crl\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nInstallation depends on the node you are installing:\n\n\nNamenode Installation\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-se-hadoop-namenode\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Namenode Installation\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-se-hadoop-secondarynamenode\n\n\n\n\n\nDatanode Installation\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-se-hadoop-datanode\n\n\n\n\n\nClient/FUSE Installation\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-se-hadoop-client\n\n\n\n\n\nStandalone Gridftp Node Installation\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-se-hadoop-gridftp\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using GUMS authorization, the follow rpms need to be installed as well:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install lcmaps-plugins-gums-client\n\nroot@host #\n yum install lcmaps-plugins-basic\n\n\n\n\n\nSRM Node Installation\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-se-hadoop-srm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are using a single system to host the SRM software and the gridftp node, you'll also need to install the \nosg-se-hadoop-gridftp\n rpm as well.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nHadoop Configuration\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNeeded by: Hadoop namenode, Hadoop datanodes, Hadoop client, GridFTP, SRM\n\n\n\n\nHadoop configuration is needed by every node in the hadoop cluster. However, in most cases, you can do the configuration once and copy it to all nodes in the cluster (possibly using your favorite configuration management tool). Special configuration for various special components is given in the below sections.\n\n\nHadoop configuration is stored in \n/etc/hadoop/conf\n. However, by default, these files are mostly blank. OSG provides a sample configuration in \n/etc/hadoop/conf.osg\n with most common values filled in. You will need to copy these into \n/etc/hadoop/conf\n before they become active. Please let us know if there are any common values that should be added/changed across the whole grid. You will likely need to modify \nhdfs-site.xml\n and \ncore-site.xml\n. Review all the settings in these files, but listed below are common settings to modify:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nExample\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncore-site.xml\n\n\nfs.default.name\n\n\nhdfs://namenode.domain.tld.:9000\n\n\nThis is the address of the namenode\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncore-site.xml\n\n\nhadoop.tmp.dir\n\n\n/data/scratch\n\n\nScratch temp directory used by Hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncore-site.xml\n\n\nhadoop.log.dir\n\n\n/var/log/hadoop-hdfs\n\n\nLog directory used by Hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncore-site.xml\n\n\ndfs.umaskmode\n\n\n002\n\n\numask for permissions used by default\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhdfs-site.xml\n\n\ndfs.block.size\n\n\n134217728\n\n\nBlock size: 128MB by default\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhdfs-site.xml\n\n\ndfs.replication\n\n\n2\n\n\nDefault replication factor.

(Otherwise, be sure to \nchown\n your storage directory to hdfs after running):\n\n\nhadoop namenode -format\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will initialize the storage directory on your namenode\n\n\nFUSE Client Configuration\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNeeded by: Hadoop client and SRM node. Recommended but not neccessary for GridFTP nodes.\n\n\n\n\nA FUSE mount is required on any node that you would like to use standard POSIX-like commands on the Hadoop filesystem. FUSE (or \"file system in user space\") is a way to access Hadoop using typical UNIX directory commands (ie POSIX-like access). Note that not all advanced functions of a full POSIX-compliant file system are necessarily available.\n\n\nFUSE is typically installed as part of this installation, but, if you are running a customized or non-standard system, make sure that the fuse kernel module is installed and loaded with \nmodprobe fuse\n.\n\n\nYou can add the FUSE to be mounted at boot time by adding the following line to \n/etc/fstab\n:\n\n\nhadoop-fuse-dfs# \n/mnt/hadoop\n fuse server=\nnamenode.host\n,port=9000,rdbuffer=131072,allow_other 0 0\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to change the \n/mnt/hadoop\n mount point and \nnamenode.host\n to match your local configuration. To match the help documents, we recommend using \n/mnt/hadoop\n as your mountpoint.\n\n\nOnce your \n/etc/fstab\n is updated, to mount FUSE run:\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop\n\nroot@host #\n mount /mnt/hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen mounting the HDFS FUSE mount, you will see the following harmless warnings printed to the screen:\n\n\n#\n mount /mnt/hadoop\n\nINFO fuse_options.c:162 Adding FUSE arg /mnt/hadoop\n\n\nINFO fuse_options.c:110 Ignoring option allow_other\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have troubles mounting FUSE refer to \nRunning FUSE in Debug Mode\n in the Troubleshooting section.\n\n\nCreating VO and User Areas\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nGrid Users are needed by GridFTP and SRM nodes. VO areas are common to all nodes.\n\n\n\n\nFor this package to function correctly, you will have to create the users needed for grid operation. Any user that can be authenticated should be created.\n\n\nFor grid-mapfile users, each line of the grid-mapfile is a certificate/user pair. Each user in this file should be created on the server.\n\n\nFor gums users, this means that each user that can be authenticated by gums should be created on the server.\n\n\nNote that these users must be kept in sync with the authentication method. For instance, if new users or rules are added in gums, then new users should also be added here.\n\n\nPrior to starting basic day-to-day operations, it is important to create dedicated areas for each VO and/or user. This is similar to user management in simple UNIX filesystems. Create (and maintain) usernames and groups with UIDs and GIDs on \nall nodes\n. These are maintained in basic system files such as \n/etc/passwd\n and \n/etc/group\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn the examples below It is assumed a FUSE mount is set to \n/mnt/hadoop\n. As an alternative \nhadoop fs\n commands could have been used.\n\n\n\n\nFor clean HDFS operations and filesystem management:\n\n\n(a) Create top-level VO subdirectories under \n/mnt/hadoop\n.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/cms\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/dzero\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/sbgrid\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/fermigrid\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/cmstest\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/osg\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Create individual top-level user areas, under each VO area, as needed.\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/tanyalevshina\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/michaelthomas\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/brianbockelman\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/douglasstrain\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/abhisheksinghrana\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Adjust username:group ownership of each area.\n\n\nroot@host #\n chown -R cms:cms /mnt/hadoop/cms\n\nroot@host #\n chown -R sam:sam /mnt/hadoop/dzero\n\n\nroot@host #\n chown -R michaelthomas:cms /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/michaelthomas\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP Configuration\n\n\ngridftp-hdfs reads the Hadoop configuration file to learn how to talk to Hadoop. By now, you should have followed the instruction for installing hadoop as detailed in the previous section as well as created the proper users/directories.\n\n\nThe default settings in \n/etc/gridftp.conf\n along with \n/etc/gridftp.d/gridftp-hdfs.conf\n are used by the init.d script and should be ok for most installations. The file \n/etc/gridftp-hdfs/gridftp-debug.conf\n is used by \n/usr/bin/gridftp-hdfs-standalone\n for starting up the GridFTP server in a testing mode. Any additional config files under \n/etc/gridftp.d\n will be used for both the init.d and standalone GridFTP server. \n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n contains additional site-specific environment variables that are used by the gridftp-hdfs dsi module in both the init.d and standalone GridFTP server. Some of the environment variables that can be used in \n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption Name\n\n\nNeeds Editing?\n\n\nSuggested value\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_HDFS_REPLICA_MAP\n\n\nNo\n\n\nFile containing a list of paths and replica values for setting the default # of replicas for specific file paths\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_BUFFER_COUNT\n\n\nNo\n\n\nThe number of 1MB memory buffers used to reorder data streams before writing them to Hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_FILE_BUFFER_COUNT\n\n\nNo\n\n\nThe number of 1MB file-based buffers used to reorder data streams before writing them to Hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_SYSLOG\n\n\nNo\n\n\nSet this to 1 in case if you want to send transfer activity data to syslog (only used for the HadoopViz application)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_HDFS_MOUNT_POINT\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nThe location of the FUSE mount point used during the Hadoop installation. Defaults to /mnt/hadoop. This is needed so that gridftp-hdfs can convert fuse paths on the incoming URL to native Hadoop paths. \nNote:\n this does not imply you need FUSE mounted on GridFTP nodes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_LOAD_LIMIT\n\n\nNo\n\n\nGridFTP will refuse to start new transfers if the load on the GridFTP host is higher than this number; defaults to 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTMPDIR\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nThe temp directory where the file-based buffers are stored. Defaults to /tmp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n is also a good place to increase per-process resource limits. For example, many installations will require more than the default number of open files (\nulimit -n\n).\n\n\nLastly, you will need to configure an authentication mechanism for GridFTP.\n\n\nConfiguring authentication\n\n\nFor information on how to configure authentication for your GridFTP installation, please refer to the \nconfiguring authentication section of the GridFTP guide\n.\n\n\nGridFTP Gratia Transfer Probe Configuration\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNeeded by GridFTP node only.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gratia probe requires the file \nuser-vo-map\n to exist and be up to date. This file is created and updated by the \ngums-client\n package that comes in as a dependency of \nosg-se-hadoop-gridftp\n or \nosg-gridftp-hdfs\n. Assuming you installed GridFTP using the \nosg-se-hadoop-gridftp\n rpm, the Gratia Transfer Probe will already be installed.\n\n\nHere are the most relevant file and directory locations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nNeeds Editing?\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbe Configuration\n\n\nYes\n\n\n/etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbe Executables\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/usr/share/gratia/gridftp-transfer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog files\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/var/log/gratia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporary files\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/var/lib/gratia/tmp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGums configuration\n\n\nYes\n\n\n/etc/gums/gums-client.properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RPM installs the Gratia probe into the system crontab, but does not configure it. The configuration of the probe is controlled by the file\n\n\n/etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is usually one XML node spread over multiple lines. Note that comments (#) have no effect on this file. You will need to edit the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\n\n\nNeeds Editing\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbeName\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nThis should be set to \"gridftp-transfer:\n\", where \n is the fully-qualified domain name of your gridftp host.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollectorHost\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nSet to the hostname and port of the central collector. By default it sends to the OSG collector. See below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiteName\n\n\nYes\n\n\nSet to the resource group name of your site as registered in OIM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridftpLogDir\n\n\nYes\n\n\nSet to /var/log, or wherever your current gridftp logs are located\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrid\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nSet to \"ITB\" if this is a test resource; otherwise, leave as OSG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUserVOMapFile\n\n\nNo\n\n\nThis should be set to /var/lib/osg/user-vo-map; see below for information about this file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppressUnknownVORecords\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nSet to 1 to suppress any records that can't be matched to a VO; 0 is strongly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppressNoDNRecords\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nSet to 1 to suppress records that can't be matched to a DN; 0 is strongly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnableProbe\n\n\nYes\n\n\nSet to 1 to enable the probe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting a collector host\n\n\nThe collector is the central server which logs the GridFTP transfers into a database. There are usually three options:\n\n\n\n\nOSG Transfer Collector\n: This is the primary collector for transfers in the OSG. Use CollectorHost=\"gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80\".\n\n\nOSG-ITB Transfer Collector\n: This is the test collector for transfers in the OSG. Use CollectorHost=\" gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80\".\n\n\nSite local collector\n: If your site has set up its own collector, then your admin will be able to give you an endpoint to use. Typically, this is along the lines of CollectorHost=\"collector.example.com:8880\".\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n if you are installing on an itb site, use \ngratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org\n instead of \"gratia-osg-transfer.opensciencegrid.org* above.\n\n\nUsing GUMS authorization mode\n\n\nThe \nuser-vo-map\n file is a simple, space-separated format that contains 2 columns; the first is a unix username and the second is the VO which that username correspond to. In order to create it you need to configure the gums client.\n\n\nThe primary configuration file for the gums-client utilities is located in \n/etc/gums/gums-client.properties\n. The two properties that you must change are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\n\n\nNeeds Editing\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngums.location\n\n\nYes\n\n\nThis should be set to the admin URL for your gums server, usually of the form gums.location=https://GUMS_HOSTNAME:8443/gums/services/GUMSAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngums.authz\n\n\nYes\n\n\nThis should be set to the authorization interface URL for your gums server, usually of the form gums.authz=https://GUMS_HOSTNAME:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the gums client is configured to generate the file run the following once by hand:\n\n\nroot@host #\n gums-host-cron\n\n\n\n\n\nuser-vo-map\n should be created in the following location:\n\n\n/var/lib/osg/user-vo-map\n\n\n\n\n\nTo have cron regularly update this file start the following service:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service gums-client-cron start\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the \nUserVOMapFile\n field is set to this location in\n\n\n/etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout \nuser-vo-map\n , all gridftp transfers will show up as belonging to the VO \"Unknown\".\n\n\nUsing Gridmap based authorization mode\n\n\nNote: If you are using this mode for authorization, make sure the files /etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf and /etc/grid-security/prima-authz.conf do not exist.\n\n\nIn order to enable generation of grid-mapfile and osg-user-vo-map.txt by using the edg-mkgridmap cron process to get information form VOMS servers do the following:\n\n\nedg-mkgridmap \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have not installed this package, you will need to run \nyum install edg-mkgridmap\n first.\n\n\nValidation\n\n\nRun the Gratia probe once by hand to check for functionality:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /usr/share/gratia/gridftp-transfer/GridftpTransferProbeDriver\n\n\n\n\n\nLook for any abnormal termination and report it if it is a non-trivial site issue. Look in the log files in \n/var/log/gratia/\ndate\n.log\n and make sure there are no error messages printed.\n\n\nBeStMan Configuration\n\n\nSee the \nBeStMaN documentation\n for details.\n\n\nBeStManHadoop-specific configuration\n\n\nBeStMan2 SRM uses the Hadoop FUSE mount to perform namespace operations, such as mkdir, rm, and ls. As per the Hadoop install instructions, edit \n/etc/sysconfig/hadoop\n and run \nservice hadoop-firstboot start\n. It is \nnot\n necessary (or even recommended) to start any hadoop services with \nservice hadoop start\n.\n\n\nMake sure that you modify \nlocalPathListAllowed\n to use the Hadoop mount in \n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc\n.\n\n\nModify /etc/sudoers\n\n\nBeStman requires the \"sudo\" command in order to write information as the proper user. You will need to give the bestman user the proper permissions to run these commands.\n\n\nModify \n/etc/sudoers\n and comment the following line.\n\n\n#Defaults    requiretty\n\n\n\n\n\nThen add the following lines at the end of the \n/etc/sudoers\n file.\n\n\nCmnd_Alias SRM_CMD = /bin/rm, /bin/mkdir, /bin/rmdir, /bin/mv, /bin/cp, /bin/ls\nRunas_Alias SRM_USR = ALL, !root\nbestman   ALL=(SRM_USR) NOPASSWD: SRM_CMD\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy certificates to bestman location\n\n\nBeStMan2 is preconfigured to look for the \nhost\n certificate and key in \n/etc/grid-security/bestman/bestman*.pem\n. Either, these files \nmust\n exist and be \nowned\n by the \nbestman\n user, or you must change the settings in \nbestman2.rc\n. Note that you must use host certificates here or lcg-utils may experience issues.\n\n\nBeStMan requires a certificate pair to function. In order to use lcg-utils, this must be a host certificate (rather than a service certificate). The following shows how to copy your certificates\n\n\ncp /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem /etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmankey.pem\n\n\ncp /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem /etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmancert.pem\n\n\nchown -R bestman:bestman /etc/grid-security/bestman/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen modify \nCertFileName\n, \nKeyFileName\n in \n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc\n.\n\n\nHadoop Storage Probe Configuration\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis is only needed by the Hadoop Namenode\n\n\n\n\nHere are the most relevant file and directory locations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nNeeds Editing?\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbe Configuration\n\n\nYes\n\n\n/etc/gratia/hadoop-storage/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbe Executable\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/usr/share/gratia/hadoop-storage/hadoop_storage_probe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog files\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/var/log/gratia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporary files\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/var/lib/gratia/tmp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RPM installs the Gratia probe into the system crontab, but does not configure it.

Obtaining grid credentials is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\n\n\nuser$ globus-url-copy file:///home/users/jdost/test.txt gsiftp://devg-7.t2.ucsd.edu:2811/mnt/hadoop/engage/test.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are having troubles running GridFTP refer to \nStarting GridFTP in Standalone Mode\n in the Troubleshooting section.\n\n\nBeStMan Validation\n\n\nThere are three ways of validating BeStMan: * SrmTester: BeStMan testing application * InstallRSV: RSV monitoring tools * BestMan client tools\n\n\nSee the relevant pages for the first two options. This section will detail some basic client commands to validate. You will need grid credentials in order to test using client tools.\n\n\nsrm-ping srm://BeStMan_host:secured_http_port/srm/v2/server\n\n\nsrm-copy file:////tmp/test1  srm://BeStMan_host:secured_http_port/srm/v2/server\\?SFN=/mnt/hadoop/VONAME/test_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsrm-ping\n tool should return a valid mapping \ngumsIDMapped\n that is not null\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nTo view all of the currently configured settings of Hadoop from the web interface, enter the following url in your browser:\n\n\nhttp://\nnamenode.hostname\n:50070/conf\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see the entire configuration in XML format, for example:\n\n\n\n  \nExpand XML configuration\n\n    \n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n

Building and installing a \nfuse\n kernel module for your custom kernel is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\nRunning FUSE in Debug Mode\n\n\nTo start the FUSE mount in debug mode, you can run the FUSE mount command by hand:\n\n\nroot@host #\n  /usr/bin/hadoop-fuse-dfs  /mnt/hadoop -o rw,server\n=\nnamenode.host\n,port\n=\n9000\n,rdbuffer\n=\n131072\n,allow_other -d\n\n\n\n\n\nDebug output will be printed to stderr, which you will probably want to redirect to a file. Most FUSE-related problems can be tackled by reading through the stderr and looking for error messages.\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\n#GridFTPStand\n\n\nStarting GridFTP in Standalone Mode\n\n\nIf you would like to test the gridftp-hdfs server in a debug standalone mode, you can run the command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n gridftp-hdfs-standalone\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standalone server runs on port 5002, handles a single GridFTP request, and will log output to stdout/stderr.\n\n\nFile Locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\n\nFile Type\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nNeeds editing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nLog files\n\n\n/var/log/hadoop/*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nPID files\n\n\n/var/run/hadoop/*.pid\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\ninit scripts\n\n\n/etc/init.d/hadoop\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\ninit script config file\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/hadoop\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nruntime config files\n\n\n/etc/hadoop/conf/*\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nSystem binaries\n\n\n/usr/bin/hadoop\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nJARs\n\n\n/usr/lib/hadoop/*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nruntime config files\n\n\n/etc/hosts_exclude\n\n\nYes, must be present on namenodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nLog files\n\n\n/var/log/gridftp-auth.log\n, \n/var/log/gridftp.log\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\ninit.d script\n\n\n/etc/init.d/globus-gridftp-server\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nruntime config files\n\n\n/etc/gridftp-hdfs/*\n, \n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nSystem binaries\n\n\n/usr/bin/gridftp-hdfs-standalone\n, \n/usr/sbin/globus-gridftp-server\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nSystem libraries\n\n\n/usr/lib64/libglobus_gridftp_server_hdfs.so*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nGUMS client (called by LCMAPS) configuration\n\n\n/etc/lcmaps.db\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nCA certificates\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/certificates/*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService/Process\n\n\nConfiguration File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeStMan2\n\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc\n\n\nMain Configuration file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2\n\n\nEnvironment variables used by BeStMan2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2lib\n\n\nEnvironment variables that store values of various client and server libraries used by BeStMan2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/*\n\n\nOther runtime configuration files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/init.d/bestman2\n\n\ninit.d startup script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/gridftp.conf\n\n\nStartup parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService/Process\n\n\nLog File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeStMan2\n\n\n/var/log/bestman2/bestman2.log\n\n\nBeStMan2 server log and errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/log/bestman2/event.srm.log\n\n\nRecords all SRM transactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\n/var/log/gridftp.log\n\n\nTransfer log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/log/gridftp-auth.log\n\n\nAuthentication log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/log/messages\n\n\nMain system log (look here for LCMAPS errors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nReplicas\n\n\nYou may need to change the following line in \n/usr/share/gridftp-hdfs/gridftp-hdfs-environment\n:\n\n\nexport GRIDFTP_HDFS_REPLICAS=2\n\n\n\n\n\ncopyFromLocal java IOException\n\n\nWhen trying to copy a local file into Hadoop you may come across the following java exception:\n\n\n\n  \nShow detailed java exception\n\n    \n\n\n11/06/24 11:10:50 WARN hdfs.DFSClient: Error Recovery for block null bad datanode[0]\n\n\nnodes == null\n\n\n11/06/24 11:10:50 WARN hdfs.DFSClient: Could not get block locations.

Throughout this document, it will be stated which node the relevant installation instructions apply to. It can apply to one of the following:    Namenode : You will have at least one namenode. The name node functions as the directory server and coordinator of the hadoop cluster. It houses all the meta-data for the hadoop cluster.  The namenode and secondary namenode need to have a directory that they can both access on a shared filesystem so that they can exchange filesystem checkpoints.  Secondary Namenode : This is a secondary machine that periodically merges updates to the HDFS file system back into the fsimage. This dramatically improves startup and restart times.  Datanode : You will have many datanodes. Each data node stores large blocks of files to be stored on the hadoop cluster.  Client : This is a documentation shorthand that refers to any machine with the hadoop client commands and  FUSE  mount. Any machine that needs a FUSE mount to access data in a POSIX-like fashion will need this.  GridFTP node : This is a node with  Globus GridFTP . The GridFTP server for Hadoop can be very memory-hungry, up to 500MB/transfer in the default configuration. You should plan accordingly to provision enough GridFTP servers to handle the bandwidth that your site can support.  SRM node : This node will contain the BeStMan SRM frontend for accessing the Hadoop cluster via the SRM protocol.  BeStMan2 SRM   Note that these components are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For instance, you may consider having your GridFTP server co-located on the SRM node. Alternatively, you can locate a client (or even a GridFTP node) co-located on each data node. That way, each data node also acts as an access point to the hadoop cluster.   Note  Total installation time, on an average, should not exceed 8 to 24 man-hours.

By now, you should have followed the instruction for installing hadoop as detailed in the previous section as well as created the proper users/directories.  The default settings in  /etc/gridftp.conf  along with  /etc/gridftp.d/gridftp-hdfs.conf  are used by the init.d script and should be ok for most installations. The file  /etc/gridftp-hdfs/gridftp-debug.conf  is used by  /usr/bin/gridftp-hdfs-standalone  for starting up the GridFTP server in a testing mode. Any additional config files under  /etc/gridftp.d  will be used for both the init.d and standalone GridFTP server.  /etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs  contains additional site-specific environment variables that are used by the gridftp-hdfs dsi module in both the init.d and standalone GridFTP server. Some of the environment variables that can be used in  /etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs  include:            Option Name  Needs Editing?

Defaults to /mnt/hadoop. This is needed so that gridftp-hdfs can convert fuse paths on the incoming URL to native Hadoop paths.  Note:  this does not imply you need FUSE mounted on GridFTP nodes!    GRIDFTP_LOAD_LIMIT  No  GridFTP will refuse to start new transfers if the load on the GridFTP host is higher than this number; defaults to 20.    TMPDIR  Maybe  The temp directory where the file-based buffers are stored. Defaults to /tmp.     /etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs  is also a good place to increase per-process resource limits.

            "text": "Installing and Maintaining XRootD\n\n\nXRootD\n is a hierarchical storage system that can be used\nin a variety of ways to access data, typically distributed among actual storage\nresources. One way to use XRootD is to have it refer to many data resources at a\nsingle site, and another way to use it is to refer to many storage systems, most\nlikely distributed among sites. An XRootD system includes a \nredirector\n, which\naccepts requests for data and finds a storage repository\u00a0\u2014 locally or\notherwise\u00a0\u2014 that can provide the data to the requestor.\n\n\nUse this page to learn how to install, configure, and use an XRootD redirector\nas part of a Storage Element (SE) or as part of a global namespace.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points:\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If it does not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user ID \nxrootd\n\n\nService certificate:\n The XRootD service uses a host certificate at \n/etc/grid-security/host*.pem\n\n\nNetworking:\n The XRootD service uses port 1094 by default\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling an XRootD Server\n\n\nAn installation of the XRootD server consists of the server itself and its\ndependencies. Install these with Yum:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring an XRootD Server\n\n\nMinimal configuration\n\n\nA new installation of XRootD is already configured to run a standalone server\nthat serves files from \n/tmp\n on the local file system. This configuration is\nuseful to verify basic connectivity between your clients and your server. To do\nthis, start the \nxrootd\n service with standalone config as described in the\n\nmanaging services section\n.\n\n\nYou should be able now to copy a file such as \n/bin/sh\n using \nxrdcp\n command\ninto \n/tmp\n. To test, do:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install xrootd-client\n\nroot@host #\n xrdcp /bin/sh root://localhost:1094//tmp/first_test\n\n[xrootd] Total 0.76 MB  |====================| 100.00 % [inf MB/s]\n\n\nroot@host #\n ls -l /tmp/first_test\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 xrootd xrootd 801512 Apr 11 10:48 /tmp/first_test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than for testing, a standalone server is useful when you want to serve\nfiles off of a single host with lots of large disks. If your storage capacity is\nspread out over multiple hosts, you will need to set up an XRootD cluster.\n\n\nAdvanced configuration\n\n\nAn advanced XRootD setup has multiple components; it is important to validate\nthat each additional component that you set up is working before moving on to\nthe next component. We have included validation instructions after each\ncomponent below.\n\n\nCreating an XRootD cluster\n\n\n\n\nIf your storage is spread out over multiple hosts, you will need to set up an\nXRootD \ncluster\n. The cluster uses one \"redirector\" node as a frontend for user\naccesses, and multiple data nodes that have the data that users request. Two\ndaemons will run on each node:\n\n\nxrootd\n\nThe eXtended Root Daemon controls file access and storage.\n\n\ncmsd\n\nThe Cluster Management Services Daemon controls communication between nodes.\n\n\nNote that for large virtual organizations, a site-level redirector may actually\nalso communicate upwards to a regional or global redirector that handles access\nto a multi-level hierarchy. This section will only cover handling one level of\nXRootD hierarchy.\n\n\nIn the instructions below, \nRDRNODE\n will refer to the redirector host\nand \nDATANODE\n will refer to the data node host. These should be\nreplaced with the fully-qualified domain name of the host in question.\n\n\nModify /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nYou will need to modify the \nxrootd-clustered.cfg\n on the redirector node and\neach data node. The following example should serve as a base configuration for\nclustering. Further customizations are detailed below.\n\n\nall.export \n/tmp\n stage\nset xrdr = \nRDRNODE\n\nall.manager $(xrdr):3121\n\nif $(xrdr)\n  # Lines in this block are only executed on the redirector node\n  all.role manager\nelse\n  # Lines in this block are executed on all nodes but the redirector node\n  all.role server\n  cms.space min \n2g 5g\n\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to customize the following lines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Line\n\n\nChanges Needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nall.export \n/tmp\n stage\n\n\nChange \n/tmp\n to the directory to allow XRootD access to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset xrdr=\nRDRNODE\n\n\nChange to the hostname of the redirector\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncms.space min \n2g 5g\n\n\nReserve this amount of free space on the node. For this example, if space falls below 2GB, xrootd will not store further files on this node until space climbs above 5GB. You can use \nk\n, \nm\n, \ng\n, or \nt\n to indicate kilobyte, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information can be found at \nhttp://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/doc\n\n\nVerifying the clustered config\n\n\nStart both \nxrootd\n and \ncmsd\n on all nodes according to the instructions in the\n\nmanaging services section\n.\n\n\nVerify that you can copy a file such as \n/bin/sh\n to \n/tmp\n on the server data\nvia the redirector:\n\n\nroot@host #\n xrdcp /bin/sh  root://\nRDRNODE\n:1094///tmp/second_test\n\n[xrootd] Total 0.76 MB  |====================| 100.00 % [inf MB/s]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck that the \n/tmp/second_test\n is located on data server \nDATANODE\n.\n\n\n(Optional) Adding Simple Server Inventory to your cluster\n\n\nThe Simple Server Inventory (SSI) provide means to have an inventory for each\ndata server. SSI requires:\n\n\n\n\nA second instance of the \nxrootd\n daemon on the redirector\n\n\nA \"composite name space daemon\" (\nXrdCnsd\n) on each data server; this daemon handles the inventory\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, we will set up a two-node XRootD cluster with SSI.\n\n\nHost A is a redirector node that is running the following daemons:\n\n\n\n\nxrootd redirector\n\n\ncmsd\n\n\nxrootd - second instance that required for SSI\n\n\n\n\nHost B is a data server that is running the following daemons:\n\n\n\n\nxrootd data server\n\n\ncmsd\n\n\nXrdCnsd - started automatically by xrootd\n\n\n\n\nWe will need to create a directory on the redirector node for Inventory files.\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /data/inventory\n\nroot@host #\n chown xrootd:xrootd /data/inventory\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the data server (host B) let's create the storage cache that will be different from \n/tmp\n.\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p  /local/xrootd\n\nroot@host #\n chown xrootd:xrootd /local/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be running two instances of XRootD on \nhostA\n. Modify\n\n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n to give the two instances different behavior,\nas such:\n\n\nall.export /data/xrootdfs\nset xrdr=\nhostA\n\nall.manager $(xrdr):3121\nif $(xrdr) \namp;\namp; named cns\n      all.export /data/inventory\n      xrd.port 1095\nelse if $(xrdr)\n      all.role manager\n      xrd.port 1094\nelse\n      all.role server\n      oss.localroot /local/xrootd\n      ofs.notify closew create mkdir mv rm rmdir trunc | /usr/bin/XrdCnsd -d -D 2 -i 90 -b $(xrdr):1095:/data/inventory\n      #add cms.space if you have less the 11GB\n      # cms.space options http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/doc/dev/cms_config.htm\n      cms.space min 2g 5g\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting a second instance of XRootD on EL 6\n\n\nThe procedure for starting a second instance differs between EL 6 and EL 7. This\nsection is the procedure for EL 6.\n\n\nNow, we have to change \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd\n on the redirector node (\nhostA\n) to run multiple instances of xrootd. The second instance of xrootd will be named \"cns\" and will be used for SSI.\n\n\nXROOTD\\_USER=xrootd \nXROOTD\\_GROUP=xrootd \nXROOTD\\_DEFAULT\\_OPTIONS=\n-k 7\n -l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nXROOTD\\_CNS\\_OPTIONS=\n-k 7 -l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n \nCMSD\\_DEFAULT\\_OPTIONS=\n-k 7\n -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n \nFRMD\\_DEFAULT\\_OPTIONS=\n-k 7\n -l /var/log/xrootd/frmd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n \n\nXROOTD\\_INSTANCES=\ndefault cns\n \nCMSD\\_INSTANCES=\ndefault\n \nFRMD\\_INSTANCES=\ndefault\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can start xrootd cluster executing the following commands.

Once you are finished, you can mount it:\n\n\nmount /mnt/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to run UNIX commands such as \nls /mnt/xrootd\n to see the contents of the XRootD server.\n\n\n(Optional) Authorization\n\n\nThere are several authorization options in XRootD available through the security\nplugins. In this document, we will cover two options for security:\n\n\n\n\nSimple Unix Security\n: Based on user accounts that the client is\n    logged in as.\n\n\nShared-key based authentication\n.\n\n\nxrootd-lcmaps\n: Using the LCMAPS callout to use X509-based\n    authentication\n\n\n\n\nNote: On the data nodes, the files will actually be owned by unix user \nxrootd\n\n(or other daemon user), not as the user authenticated to, under most\ncircumstances. xrootd will verify the permissions and authorization based on the\nuser that the security plugin authenticates you to (for instance, your unix user\nfor option 1 or your gums id for option 2), but, internally, the data node files\nwill be owned by the \nxrootd\n user.\n\n\nAuthorization file\n\n\nIn order to add security to your cluster you will need to add \"auth_file\" on\nthe your data server node. Create \n/etc/xrootd/auth_file\n :\n\n\n\\# This means that all the users have read access to the datasets \nu \\* \n/data/xrootdfs\n lr\n\n\\# This means that all the users have full access to their private dirs \nu = \n/data/xrootdfs/\n@=/ a\n\n\\# This means that this privileged user can do everything \n\\# You need at least one user like that, in order to create the \n\\# private dir for each user willing to store his data in the facility \nu xrootd \n/data/xrootdfs\n a \n\n\n\n\n\nHere we assume that your storage path is \n/data/xrootdfs\n (same as in the\nprevious example).\n\n\nChange file ownership (if you have created file as root):\n\n\nroot@host #\n chown xrootd:xrootd /etc/xrootd/auth\n\\_\nfile\n\n\n\n\n\nThis file is a flat file of the following form:\n\n\nidtype id path privs\n\n\n\n\n\nSome examples of each option.

See the following documents for instructions:\n\n\n\n\nInstall CA certificates\n\n\nManaging Certificate Revocation Lists\n\n\n\n\nInstall xrootd-lcmaps\n\n\nyum install xrootd-lcmaps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the xrootd-lcmaps is usually coupled to a specific version of xrootd,\nso make sure that you install xrootd-lcmaps from the same repository that you\ninstall xrootd from. Otherwise, you may have dependency issues due to differing\nversions of shared libraries.\n\n\nCreate host certificates\n\n\nYou will need to have a X509 certificate to talk to GUMS. If you already have a\nhost certificate, you can use a copy of that:\n\n\n mkdir /etc/grid-security/xrd\n\n\n cp /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem /etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdkey.pem\n\n\n cp /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem /etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdcert.pem\n\n\n chown -R xrootd:xrootd /etc/grid-security/xrd/\n\n\n chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis certificate should be owned by xrootd and located in \n/etc/grid-security/xrd\n.\n\n\nAuthorization File\n\n\nNext, create \n/etc/xrootd/auth_file\n using the example in the above section.\n\n\nModify /etc/xrootd/lcmaps.cfg\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/xrootd/lcmaps.cfg\n to point to your authorization server (replace the\nhostname in red):\n\n\nscasclient = \nlcmaps_scas_client.mod\n\n             \n-resourcetype wn\n\n             \n-actiontype execute-now\n\n             \n-capath /etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n             \n-cert   /etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdcert.pem\n\n             \n-key    /etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdkey.pem\n\n             \n--endpoint https://\ngums.fnal.gov\n:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nYou will need to add the security plugins to \n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n. Add the following lines to the \n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n. This will need to be added to all data nodes in the section relevant to the data node server. (For instance, in the above example(s), this should be placed in the last \"else\" clause after \"all.role server\". See the section above on Unix security for an example of where the security commands should go).\n\n\nxrootd.seclib /usr/lib64/libXrdSec.so\n\nset CERTDIR=-certdir:/etc/grid-security/certificates\nset CERT=-cert:/etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdcert.pem\nset KEY=-key:/etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdkey.pem\nset AUTHZFUN=-authzfun:libXrdLcmaps.so\nset AUTHZFUNPARMS=-authzfunparms:--osg,--lcmapscfg,/etc/xrootd/lcmaps.cfg,--loglevel,0|useglobals\n\nsec.protocol /usr/lib64 gsi $CERTDIR $CERT $KEY -crl:3 $AUTHZFUN $AUTHZFUNPARMS --gmapopt:2 --gmapto:0\nacc.authdb /etc/xrootd/auth_file\nofs.authorize\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart xrootd and cmsd\n\n\nroot@host #\n service xrootd restart\n\nroot@host #\n service cmsd restart\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting an XRootd Cluster with LCMAPS security enabled\n\n\nFrom any machine with the \nxrootd-client\n installed, you can test with xrdcp. With a user that has no grid certificate installed, you should get an error:\n\n\nuser@host $\n xrdcp /bin/bash root://HOSTNAME/tmp/lcmaps_test\n\n120327 14:31:52 10509 secgsi_InitProxy: cannot access private key file: /home/dstrain/.globus/userkey.pem\n\n\nXrdSec: No authentication protocols are available.\n\n\nLast server error 3010 (\ncannot obtain credentials for protocol: Secgsi: ErrParseBuffer: error getting user proxies: kXGS_init: unable to get protocol object.\n)\n\n\nError accessing path/file for root://fermicloud121.fnal.gov/tmp/test2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter running \nvoms-proxy-init\n or \ngrid-proxy-init\n to initialize your x509 certificate (usually found in \n/tmp/x509up_uUID\n), the \nxrdcp\n command should execute cleanly.

If you are not setting up a CMS site, you can skip\nthis section.\n\n\nyum install --enablerepo=osg-contrib xrootd-cmstfc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to add your \nstorage.xml\n to \n/etc/xrootd/storage.xml\n and then\nadd the following line to your xrootd configuration:\n\n\n# Integrate with CMS TFC, placed in /etc/xrootd/storage.xml\noss.namelib /usr/lib64/libXrdCmsTfc.so file:/etc/xrootd/storage.xml%ORANGE%?protocol=hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the orange text only if you are running hadoop (see below).\n\n\nSee the CMS TWiki for more information:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/XrootdTfcChanges\n\n\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/HdfsXrootdInstall\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) Adding Hadoop support to XRootD\n\n\nHDFS-based sites should utilize the \nxrootd-hdfs\n plugin to allow XRootD to access\ntheir storage.\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install xrootd-hdfs\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will then need to add the following lines to your\n\n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n:\n\n\nxrootd.fslib /usr/lib64/libXrdOfs.so\nofs.osslib /usr/lib64/libXrdHdfs.so\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see \nthe HDFS installation documents\n.\n\n\n(Optional) Adding File Residency Manager (FRM) to an XRootd cluster\n\n\nIf you have a multi-tiered storage system (e.g. some data is stored on SSDs and\nsome on disks or tapes), then install the File Residency Manager (FRM), so you\ncan move data between tiers more easily. If you do not have a multi-tiered\nstorage system, then you do not need FRM and you can skip this section.\n\n\nThe FRM deals with two major mechanisms:\n\n\n\n\nlocal disk\n\n\nremote servers\n\n\n\n\nThe description of fully functional multiple xrootd clusters is beyond the scope\nof this document. In order to have this fully functional system you will need a\nglobal redirector and at least one remote xrootd cluster from where files could\nbe moved to the local cluster.\n\n\nBelow are the modifications you should make in order to enable FRM on your local\ncluster:\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that FRM is enabled in \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd\n on your data sever:\n\n\n\n\nROOTD\\_USER=xrootd \nXROOTD\\_GROUP=xrootd \nXROOTD\\_DEFAULT\\_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n \nCMSD\\_DEFAULT\\_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n \nFRMD\\_DEFAULT\\_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/frmd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n \nXROOTD\\_INSTANCES=\ndefault\n \nCMSD\\_INSTANCES=\ndefault\n \nFRMD\\_INSTANCES=\ndefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n on both nodes to specify options for \nfrm_xfrd\n (File Transfer Daemon) and \nfrm_purged\n (File Purging Daemon).

Additionally covers service planning topics.\n\n\nLoad-balanced GridFTP Install\n.  Covers the creation of\n    a load-balanced GridFTP service using multiple servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to following this installation guide, verify the host certificates and networking is\nconfigured correctly as in the \nbasic GridFTP install\n.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nGridFTP support for XRootD-based storage is provided by the \nosg-gridftp-xrootd\n meta-package:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-gridftp-xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nFor information on how to configure authentication for your GridFTP installation, please refer to\nthe \nconfiguring authentication section of the GridFTP guide\n.\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd-dsi\n to set \nXROOTD_VMP\n to use your Xrootd redirector.\n\n\nexport\n \nXROOTD_VMP\n=\nredirector:1094:/local_path=/remote_path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe syntax of \nXROOTD_VMP\n is tricky; make sure to use the following guidance:\n\n\n\n\nRedirector\n: The hostname and domain of the local XRootD redirector server.\n\n\nlocal_path\n: The path exported by the GridFTP server.\n\n\nremote_path\n: The XRootD path that will be mounted at \nlocal_path\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \nxrootd-dsi\n is enabled, GridFTP configuration changes should go into\n\n/etc/xrootd-dsi/gridftp-xrootd.conf\n, not \n/etc/gridftp.conf\n.  Sites should review any\ncustomizations made in the latter and copy them as necessary.\n\n\nYou can use the FUSE mount in order to test POSIX access to xrootd in the GridFTP server.\nYou should be able to run Unix commands such as \nls /mnt/xrootd\n and see the contents of the\nXRootD server.\n\n\nFor log / config file locations and system services to run, see the \nbasic GridFTP install\n.\n\n\nUsing XRootD\n\n\nManaging XRootD services\n\n\nStart services on the redirector node before starting any services on the data\nnodes. If you installed only XRootD itself, you will only need to start the\n\nxrootd\n service. However, if you installed cluster management services, you\nwill need to start \ncmsd\n as well.\n\n\nThe instructions for starting and stopping an XRootD service depend on whether\nthe service is installed on an EL 6 or EL 7 machine, and whether you are using a\nstandalone or clustered configuration.\n\n\nOn EL 6, which config to use is set in the file \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd\n. For\nexample, to have \nxrootd\n use the clustered config, you would have a line such\nas this:\n\n\nXROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-\nclustered\n.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the standalone config instead, you would use:\n\n\nXROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-\nstandalone\n.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL 7, which config to use is determined by the service name given to\n\nsystemctl\n. For example, to have \nxrootd\n use the clustered config, you would\nstart up \nxrootd\n with this line:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start xrootd@\nclustered\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the standalone config instead, you would use:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start xrootd@\nstandalone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService\n\n\nEL 6 service name\n\n\nEL 7 service name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRootD (standalone config)\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\nxrootd@standalone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRootD (clustered config)\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\nxrootd@clustered\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMSD (clustered config)\n\n\ncmsd\n\n\ncmsd@clustered\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as \nroot\n):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \u2026\n\n\nOn EL\u00a06, run the command\u2026\n\n\nOn EL\u00a07, run the command\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a service\n\n\nservice \nem\nSERVICE-NAME\n/em\n start\n\n\nsystemctl start \nem\nSERVICE-NAME\n/em\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop a service\n\n\nservice \nem\nSERVICE-NAME\n/em\n stop\n\n\nsystemctl start \nem\nSERVICE-NAME\n/em\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable a service to start during boot\n\n\nchkconfig \nem\nSERVICE-NAME\n/em\n on\n\n\nsystemctl enable \nem\nSERVICE-NAME\n/em\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable a service from starting during boot\n\n\nchkconfig \nem\nSERVICE-NAME\n/em\n off\n\n\nsystemctl disable \nem\nSERVICE-NAME\n/em\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nTo get assistance. please use the \nHelp Procedure\n page.\n\n\nReference\n\n\nFile locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService/Process\n\n\nConfiguration File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nMain clustered mode XRootD configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^\n\n\n/etc/xrootd/auth_file\n\n\nAuthorized users file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService/Process\n\n\nLog File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\n/var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log\n\n\nXRootD server daemon log\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncmsd\n\n\n/var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log\n\n\nCluster management log\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncns\n\n\n/var/log/xrootd/cns/xrootd.log\n\n\nServer inventory (composite name space) log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrm_xfrd\n, \nfrm_purged\n\n\n/var/log/xrootd/frmd.log\n\n\nFile Residency Manager log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\nXRootD documentation",

The LCMAPS VOMS plugin enables LCMAPS to make mapping decisions based on the VOMS attributes of grid certificates, e.g., \n/cms/Role=production/Capability=NULL\n. Starting in OSG 3.4, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin will replace GUMS and edg-mkgridmap as the authentication method at OSG sites.\n\n\nThe OSG provides a default set of mappings from VOMS attributes to Unix accounts. By configuring LCMAPS, you can override these mappings, including changing the Unix account that a VO is mapped to, banning based on VOMS attributes, banning a specific user, or adding a VO, VO group, VO role, and/or user that is not in the OSG's set of mappings.\n\n\nUse this page to learn how to install and configure the LCMAPS VOMS plugin to authenticate users to access your resources on a per-VO basis.\n\n\nInstalling the LCMAPS VOMS Plugin\n\n\nTo install the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, make sure that your host is up to date before installing the required packages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will update \nall\n packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nlcmaps\n, the default mapfile, and the configuration tools:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n yum install lcmaps vo-client-lcmaps-voms osg-configure-misc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the LCMAPS VOMS Plugin\n\n\nThe following section describes the steps required to configure the LCMAPS VOMS plugin for authentication. If you are using OSG 3.3 packages, there are software-specific instructions that must be followed for \nHTCondor-CE\n, \nGridFTP\n, and \nXRootD\n. To check if you are running OSG 3.3, run the following command:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n rpm -q --queryformat\n=\n%{VERSION}\\n\n osg-release\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there is \noptional configuration\n if you need to make changes to the default mappings.\n\n\nEnabling the LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n\n\nTo configure your host to use LCMAPS VOMS plugin authentication, edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/10-misc.ini\n and set the following options:\n\n\nedit_lcmaps_db\n \n=\n \nTrue\n\n\nauthorization_method\n \n=\n \nvomsmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the \nglexec_location\n option is present, you must comment it out or set it to \nUNAVAILABLE\n.\nThe LCMAPS VOMS plugin does not work with gLExec.\n\n\nSupporting mapped VOs and users\n\n\nUnix accounts must exist for each VO, VO role, VO group, or user you choose to support in the \nmapfiles\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsult the default VO mappings in \n/usr/share/osg/voms-mapfile-default\n to determine the mapped Unix account names. Each of the mapfiles has the following format:\n\n\nVO, VO role, VO group or user\n \nUnix account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Unix accounts for each VO, VO role, VO group, and user that you wish to support\n\n\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-gip.ini\n and specify the supported VOs per \nSubcluster or ResourceEntry section\n:\n\n\n\n\nallowed_vos\n=\nVO1,VO2...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying configuration settings\n\n\nMaking changes to the OSG configuration files in the \n/etc/osg/config.d\n directory does not apply those settings to software automatically. For the OSG settings, use the \nosg-configure\n tool to validate (to a limited extent) and apply the settings to the relevant software components. If instead you wish to manage the LCMAPS VOMS plugin configuration yourself, skip to the \nmanual configuration section\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake all changes to \n.ini\n files in the \n/etc/osg/config.d\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis document only describes the critical settings for the LCMAPS VOMS plugin and related software. You may need to configure other software that is installed on your host, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidate the configuration settings:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n osg-configure -v\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the validation command succeeds without errors, apply the configuration settings:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n osg-configure -c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional configuration\n\n\nThe following subsections contain information on migration from \nedg-mkgridmap\n, mapping or banning users by their certificates' Distinguished Names (DNs) or by their proxies' VOMS attributes. Any optional configuration is to be performed after the installation and configuration sections above.\n\n\nFor a table of the configuration files and their order of evaluation, consult the \nreference section\n.\n\n\n\n\nMigrating from edg-mkgridmap\n\n\nMapping VOs\n\n\nMapping users\n\n\nBanning VOs\n\n\nBanning users\n\n\nMapping using all FQANs\n\n\n\n\nMigrating from edg-mkgridmap\n\n\nThe program edg-mkgridmap (found in the package \nedg-mkgridmap\n), used for authentication on HTCondor-CE, GridFTP, and XRootD hosts, is no longer available starting in OSG 3.4. The LCMAPS VOMS plugin (package \nlcmaps-plugins-voms\n) now provides the same functionality. To migrate from edg-mkgridmap to the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, perform the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure user DN mappings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a local grid mapfile (see \nthe EDG-mkgridmap docs\n), replace the contents of \n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n with the contents of the local grid mapfile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not have a local grid mapfile, remove \n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are remaining on OSG 3.3, ensure that the you have set \nexport LLGT_VOMS_ENABLE_CREDENTIAL_CHECK=1\n in the appropriate file and restart the service. If you have updated your host to OSG 3.4, skip to the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your host is a(n)...\n\n\nAdd the aforementioned line to...\n\n\nAnd restart this service...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/condor-ce\n\n\ncondor-ce\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP server\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server\n\n\nglobus-gridftp-server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are converting an HTCondor-CE host, remove the HTCondor-CE \nGRIDMAP\n configuration. Otherwise, skip to the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind where \nGRIDMAP\n is set:\n\n\n[root@ce]#\n condor_ce_config_val -v GRIDMAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the above command returns \nNot defined: GRIDMAP\n, skip to step 4. Otherwise, delete the line that sets the \nGRIDMAP\n configuration variable\n\n\n\n\nReconfigure HTCondor-CE:\n[root@ce]#\n condor_ce_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove edg-mkgridmap and related packages:\n\n\n[root@ce]#\n yum erase edg-mkgridmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIn the output from this command, yum should \nnot\n list other packages than the one. If it lists other packages, cancel the erase operation, make sure the other packages are updated to their OSG 3.3 (or 3.4) versions (they should have \".osg33\" or \".osg34\" in their versions), and try again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping VOs\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/voms-mapfile\n is used to map VOs, VO roles, or VO groups to Unix accounts based on their VOMS attributes. An example of the format of a \nvoms-mapfile\n follows:\n\n\n# map GLOW jobs in the chtc group to the \nglow1\n Unix account.\n\n/GLOW/chtc/*\n glow1\n# map GLOW jobs with the htpc role to the \nglow2\n Unix account.\n\n/GLOW/Role=htpc/*\n glow2\n# map other GLOW jobs to the \nglow\n Unix account.\n\n/GLOW/*\n glow\n\n\n\n\n\nEach non-commented line is a shell-style pattern which is compared against the user's VOMS attributes, and a Unix account that the user will be mapped to if the pattern matches.\nThe patterns are compared in the order they are listed in. Therefore, more general patterns should be placed later in the file.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe Unix account must exist for the user to be mapped. If a VO's Unix account is missing, that VO will not be able to access your resources.\n\n\nAdditionally, if you map VOMS attributes to a non-existent user in \n/etc/grid-security/voms-mapfile\n, \n/usr/share/osg/voms-mapfile-default\n will be considered next to find a mapping. The best way to ban a VO is edit \n/etc/grid-security/ban-voms-mapfile\n as described in \nBanning VOs\n below. Do not edit \nvoms-mapfile-default\n as your changes will be overwritten upon updates.\n\n\n\n\nMapping users\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n is used to map specific users to Unix accounts based on their certificates' DNs. An example of the format of a \ngrid-mapfile\n follows:\n\n\n# map Matyas\ns FNAL DN to the \nmatyas\n Unix account\n\n/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Matyas Selmeci/CN=UID:matyas\n matyas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe Unix account must exist for the user to be mapped. If a user's Unix account is missing, that user will not be able to access your resources.\n\n\n\n\nBanning VOs\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/ban-voms-mapfile\n is used to ban an entire VO or a role withing a VO from accessing resources on your machine. An example of the format of a \nban-voms-mapfile\n follows:\n\n\n# ban CMS production jobs\n\n/cms/Role=production/*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach non-commented line is a shell-style pattern which is compared against a user's VOMS attributes. If the pattern matches, that user will be unable to access your resources.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/ban-voms-mapfile\n \nmust\n exist, even if you are not banning any VOs. In that case, the file should be blank. If the file does not exist, LCMAPS will ban every user.\n\n\n\n\nBanning users\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/ban-mapfile\n is used to ban specific users from accessing your resources based on their certificates' DNs. An example of the format of a \nban-mapfile\n follows:\n\n\n# ban Matyas\ns FNAL DN\n\n/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Matyas Selmeci/CN=UID:matyas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/ban-mapfile\n \nmust\n exist, even if you are not banning any users. In that case, the file should be blank. If the file does not exist, LCMAPS will ban every user.\n\n\n\n\nMapping using all FQANs\n\n\nBy default, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin only considers the first FQAN of a VOMS proxy for mapping. This matches the behavior of GUMS.

The request will be approved by an appropriate Grid\nAdmin. You will receive an email when this approval has been completed\ncontaining directions on how to run 'osg-cert-retreive' to retrieve the\ncertificate. It works in two modes:\n\n\n\n\nCSR is provided by the user: Here the csr provided is just trimmed for begin and end certificate lines and the request is sent to the OIM\n\n\nCSR is not provided by the user: Here the script generates a private key for the user. Writes it to default key file name or the one specified by -o. Then generates a new csr and sends it to OIM.\n\n\n\n\nThe second mode will commonly be used by most OSG site admins\n\n\nUse \nosg-cert-request\n to generate a request which will be sent to the\nCertificate Authority you specified. Change \"host.opensciencegrid.org\" to be the\nhost name for the computer for which you need a certificate and provide your\ncontact details for the grid admin to approve your request.\n\n\nuser@host $\n osg-cert-request -H host.opensciencegrid.org -e emailaddress@domain.com -n \nYour Name\n -p \n9999999999\n \n(\nPh No\n)\n -v \nYour VO\n -y \nxyz@domain.com,abc@domain.com\n \n(\nCC list\n)\n -m \nThis is my comment\n -o hostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nuser@host $\n osg-cert-request -H sectest.cigi.illinois.edu -e apadmana@domain.edu -n \nAnand\n -p \n9999999999\n -m \nTesting for developing security documentation\n -o hostkey.pem\n\n\nWriting key to hostkey.pem\n\n\n\nConnecting to server...\n\n\nSuccesfully submitted\n\n\nRequest Id#: 570\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point \nosg-cert-request\n has created some files in the directory you\nspecified and an e-mail has been sent to the Certificate Authority containing\nyour request.

Authenticates to OIM\nand is only for use by Grid Admins for certificates they are authorized to\napprove. This script is only supported with all hosts being in the same domain\n(so we ensure they go to the same Grid Admin). The certificates are stored with\nthe format of 'hostname-requestid.pem' (i.e. the id generated from the request\nfor the certificate). The key is stored as 'hostname-serial-key.pem'.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\nuser@host $\n osg-gridadmin-cert-request -H host.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to request more then one certificate you can list them in a file\n(one host per line) and use the following command\n\n\nuser@host $\n osg-gridadmin-cert-request -f hostfile\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed description of the osg-gridadmin-cert-request usage\n\n\nThis osg-gridadmin-cert-request script does the following in the process of\nacquiring certificates for the hostnames specified:\n\n\n\n\nReads a list of fully-qualified hostnames from a file specified by the user. \n\n\nFor each hostname: \n\n\nGenerates a new private key and CSR Only important part of CSR is CN= component \n\n\nWrites the private key to a file with filename: /-key.pem\n\n\nPrompts the user for their private key pass phrase Pass phrase is cached so user is not re-prompted \n\n\nAuthenticates to OIM and posts the CSRs as a single request to OIM Request id is returned and subsequently used \n\n\nAuthenticates to OIM and approves the request \n\n\nWaits one minute for request to be processed by OIM\n\n\nConnects to OIM and attempts to retrieve certificates \n\n\nWrites out any certificates it retrieves with filename of /-\n.pem if all certificates have been retrieved, exits loop \n\n\nWait 5 seconds and repeat.\n\n\n\n\nInputs:\n\n\n\n\nfilename of list of hostnames prefix path in which to write private keys and certificares [default: .] \n\n\npath to user's certificate [Optional, default is path specified by $X509_USER_CERT environment variable, ~/.globus/usercert.pem] \n\n\npath to user's private key [Optional, default is path specified by $X509_USER_KEY environment variable, ~/.globus/userkey.pem]\n\n\nPassphrase for user's private key via non-echoing prompt.\n\n\n\n\nOutputs:\n\n\n\n\nN host certificates in PEM format N private keys in PEM format\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n:osg-gridadmin-cert-request -h/--help [for detailed explanations of\noptions]\n\n\nOptions: \n  -h, --help show this help message and exit \n  -k PKEY, --pkey=PKEY Specify Requestor\ns private key (PEM Format). If not specified will take the value of X509\\_USER\\_KEY or $HOME/.globus/userkey.pem \n  -c CERT, --cert=CERT Specify Requestor\ns certificate (PEM Format).

Specify hostname as a single hostname using -H/--hostname or specify from a file using -f/--hostfile.\n  -H HOSTNAME, --hostname=HOSTNAME Specify the hostname or service/hostname for which you want to request the certificate for. If specified -f/--hostfile will be ignored \n  -f HOSTFILE, --hostfile=HOSTFILE Filename with one hostname or service/hostname per line\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nCan I use any host to request a certificate for a different host?\n\n\nYES, you can use any host to create a certificate request as long as the hostname for the certificate is a fully qualified domain name.\n\n\nMay I reuse my host certificate as a service certificate?\n\n\nNO! For security reasons, please do not use clones of your host certificate for additional certificates even though it's technically possible.\n\n\nHow do I renew a host/service certificate?\n\n\nThere is no separate procedure. Simply ask for a new certificate the same way you asked for it the previous time.\n\n\nI get a \"GSS authentication failure\" when users try to authenticate with my site?\n\n\nYou likely used an \nalias\n for the host instead of the fully qualified domain\nname when you generated the certificate request. This can cause the GSS\nauthentication failures similar to the following when a user tries to\nauthenticate to the host after your certificate is installed:\n\n\nGSS authentication failure \n\n\nGSS Major Status: General failure \n\n\nGSS Minor Status Error Chain: \n\n\naccept_sec_context.c:gss_accept_sec_context:403: \n\n\nError during delegation: Delegation protocol violation \n\n\nFailure: GSS failed Major:000d0000 Minor:00000001 Token:00000000 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I check if I have a host certificate installed already?\n\n\nBy default the host certificate key pair will be installed in\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n and \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n. You can\nuse \nopenssl\n to access basic information about the certificate:\n\n\nroot@host #\n openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -subject -issuer -dates -noout\n\nsubject= /DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=host.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\nissuer= /DC=org/DC=cilogon/C=US/O=CILogon/CN=CILogon OSG CA 1\n\n\nnotBefore=Apr  8 00:00:00 2013 GMT\n\n\nnotAfter=May 17 12:00:00 2014 GMT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I check the expiration time of my installed host certificate?\n\n\nIf you installed the Certificates Script Package you can use \ngrid-cert-info\n\nto retrieve information about the certificate:\n\n\nroot@host #\n grid-cert-info -file /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -startdate -enddate\n\nJan  4 21:08:41 2010 GMT\n\n\nJan  4 21:08:41 2011 GMT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively you can use \nopenssl\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -dates -noout\n\nnotBefore=Jan  4 21:08:41 2010 GMT\n\n\nnotAfter=Jan  4 21:08:41 2011 GMT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I change the URLs queried by the pki clients?\n\n\nThis configuration should not need to be changed for the vast majority of uses.\nThe information is provided in case you need it for debugging purposes.\n\n\nThe client checks for pki-clients.ini file at three location in order:\n\n\n\n\n$HOME/.osg-pki/OSG_PKI.ini\n\n\n./pki-clients.ini\n\n\n/etc/osg/pki-clients.ini (default location)\n\n\n\n\nThe INI file contains the following information:\n\n\n\n\nRequest URL\n\n\nApprove URL\n\n\nRetrieve URL\n\n\nHost URL\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nUseful OpenSSL commands (from NCSA)\n - e.g. how to convert the format of your certificate.",

See \nGet Host and Service Certificates\n.\n\n\n\n\nThis document describes how to get and set up a \npersonal\n certificate (also called a grid user certificate), from the OSG Certificate Authority (OSG CA). The OSG CA is recognized by all OSG resources. Other CAs may be used; if your virtual organization (VO) requires that you get a certificate from a different CA, \ncontact your VO Support Center\n for instructions.\n\n\nKnow your Responsibilities\n\n\nWhen you request a certificate your provide some public personal information about yourself; \nname, email address, phone number\n, and which \nVO\n (virtual organization) you belong to. If any of this information changes after you have your certificate you should notify OSG (and probably VO) of the changes. For the OSG RA send email to osg-ra at opensciencegrid dot org.\n\n\nYour \nname\n and \nemail\n address are encoded into the signed certificate and \nif either of those change\n (usually email address) then you should \nrequest a new certificate\n with the correct information and \nrevoke the old certificate\n.\n\n\nGetting your Certificate\n\n\nThere are two different ways to obtain your certificate, either via a command line interface, or through a web browser. The links below will guide you through whichever method you choose. The command line method is generally simpler and less prone to errors than using a web browser but it may require extra setup and package installation the first time you do it. Most people end up needing their certificate for both command line grid use and web browser use and it is generally easier to import your certificate into your browser (and email client) from the command line certificate files than to export your certificate from your web browser to use on the command line. This is because of the large variety of web browsers each with it's own way to deal with certificates. If you will use the certificate ONLY in your web browser then requesting it from your browser is probably the easiest method.\n\n\nGet or renew a certificate with command line interface.\n\n\nPKCS12 (.p12) vs PEM format\n\n\nYour certificate and key pair can be stored as separate files, by default named \n~/.globus/usercert.pem\n and \n~/.globus/userkey.pem\n, or they can be bundled in a single file in PKCS12 (Public Key Cryptography Standard #12), by default named \n~/.globus/usercred.p12\n. All OSG user tools works with both formats.

The command line method is generally simpler and less prone to errors than using a web browser but it may require extra setup and package installation the first time you do it. Most people end up needing their certificate for both command line grid use and web browser use and it is generally easier to import your certificate into your browser (and email client) from the command line certificate files than to export your certificate from your web browser to use on the command line. This is because of the large variety of web browsers each with it's own way to deal with certificates.

They complement the \nOIM Web Interface\n.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nIf you have not already done so, you need to \nconfigure the OSG software repositories\n.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nThe command-line scripts have been packaged as an RPM and are available from the OSG repositories.\n\n\nTo install the RPM, run:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-pki-tools\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nConfiguration Files\n\n\nThis configuration file contains information divided into two sections for testing and production.  Configuration variables include:\n\n\n\n\nRequest URL\n\n\nApprove URL\n\n\nRetrieve URL\n\n\nHost URL\n\n\n\n\nThese parameters are used as input to the script depending upon the mode of execution of the script (test or OIM). The command-line utilities check for configuration files in the following order:\n\n\n\n\n$HOME/.osg-pki/OSG_PKI.ini\n\n\n./pki-clients.ini\n\n\n/etc/pki-clients.ini\n\n\n\n\nosg-cert-request\n\n\nSends a request for a host certificate.\n\n\nThis script generates a private key and submits a request for a certificate to the OSG PKI.

This will persist until the machine is rebooted.\n\n\nroot@host#\n service osg-ca-certs-updater-cron start\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following to enable the updater when the machine is rebooted.\n\n\nroot@host#\n chkconfig osg-ca-certs-updater-cron on\n\n\n\n\n\nRun both commands if you wish for the service to activate immediately and remain active throughout reboots.\n\n\nStopping and Disabling Services\n\n\nEnter the following to disable the updater. This will persist until the machine is rebooted.\n\n\nroot@host#\n service osg-ca-certs-updater-cron stop\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the following to disable the updater when the machine is rebooted.\n\n\nroot@host#\n chkconfig osg-ca-certs-updater-cron off\n\n\n\n\n\nRun both commands if you wish for the service to deactivate immediately and not get reactivated during reboots.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nWhile there is no configuration file, the behavior of the updater can be adjusted by command-line arguments that are specified in the \ncron\n entry of the service. This entry is located in the file \n/etc/cron.d/osg-ca-certs-updater\n. Please see the Unix manual page for \ncrontab\n in section 5 for an explanation of the format. The manual page can be accessed by the command \nman 5 crontab\n. The valid command-line arguments can be listed by running \nosg-ca-certs-updater --help\n. Reasonable defaults have been provided, namely:\n\n\n\n\nAttempt an update no more often than every 23 hours. Due to the random wait (see below), having a 24-hour minimum time between updates would cause the update time to slowly slide back every day.\n\n\nRun the script every 6 hours. We run the script more often than we update so that downtime at the wrong moment does not cause the update to be delayed for a full day.\n\n\nDelay for a random amount of time up to 30 minutes before updating, to reduce load spikes on OSG repositories.\n\n\nDo not warn the administrator about update failures that have happened less than 72 hours since the last successful update.\n\n\nLog errors only.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nUseful configuration and log files\n\n\nConfiguration file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-certs-updater\n\n\nCron entry for periodically launching the updater\n\n\n/etc/cron.d/osg-ca-certs-updater\n\n\nCommand-line arguments to the updater can be specified here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-release\n\n\nRepo definition files for production OSG repositories\n\n\n/etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo\n or \n/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-el6.repo\n\n\nMake sure these repositories are enabled and reachable from the host you are trying to update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog files\n\n\nLogging is performed to the console by default. Please see the manual for your \ncron\n daemon to find out how it handles console output.\n\n\nA logfile can be specified via the \n-l\n / \n--logfile\n command-line option.\n\n\nIf logging to syslog via the \n-s\n / \n--log-to-syslog\n option, the updater will write to the \nuser\n section of the syslog. The file \n/etc/syslog.conf\n determines where syslog messages are saved.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSome guides on X.509 certificates:\n\n\n\n\nUseful commands: \nhttp://security.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/grid-howtos/usefulopenssl.html\n\n\nInstall GSI authentication on a server: \nhttp://security.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/wssec/gsihttps/\n\n\nCertificates how-to: \nhttp://www.nordugrid.org/documents/certificate_howto.html\n\n\n\n\nSome examples about verifying the certificates:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://gagravarr.org/writing/openssl-certs/others.shtml\n\n\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/test-ssl-certificates-diagnosis-ssl-certificate/\n\n\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/debugging-ssl-communications-from-unix-shell-prompt.html\n\n\n\n\nManaging CAs\n\n\nThe osg-ca-manage tool provides a unified interface to manage the CA Certificate installations. This page provides the instructions on using this command. It provides status commands that allows you to list the CAs and the validity of the CAs and CRLs included in the installation. The manage commands allow you to fetch CAs and CRLs, change the distribution URL, as well as add and remove CAs from your local installation.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n   osg-ca-manage [global_options] command \n    global_options =\n        [--verbose]\n        [--force]\n        [--cert-dir \nlocation\n]\n        [--help | --usage]\n        [--version]\n        [--auto-refresh]\n\n    command = [manage_command | status_command]\n\n    status_command = [\n        showCAURL |\n        listCA [--pattern \npattern\n] |\n        verify [--hash \nCA hash\n  | --pattern \npattern\n] |\n        diffCAPackage |\n        show [--certfile \ncert_file\n | --hash \nCA hash\n] |\n        showChain [--certfile \ncert_file\n | --hash \nCA hash\n]\n    ]\n\n    manage_command = [\n        setupCA --location \nroot|PATH\n [--url \nosg|igtf|URL\n --no-update --force] |\n        refreshCA |\n        fetchCRL |\n        setCAURL [--url \nosg|igtf|URL\n] |\n        add [--cadir \nlocaldir\n | --caname \nCA\n]\n        remove [--cadir \nlocaldir\n | --caname \nCA\n]\n    ]\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of global options\n\n\nZero or more of these options may be used during an execution of ca_manage.\n\n\n\n\n--verbose\n Provides you with more information depending on the command context.\n\n\n--force\n Forces the command to run ignoring any checks/warnings. The actual effect is context dependent, and this behavior is noted in the command details below.\n\n\n--cert-dir \nlocation\n This location specifies the path CA directory. If this option is not specified then the command will look for \n$X509_CERT_DIR\n followed by \n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n. If none of these directories can be found, the command will exit with an error.\n\n\n--auto-refresh\n This option will indicate if this permissible to fetch CAs and CRLs as deemed necessary by this tool. For example at the end of an addCA/removeCA it would be advisable to refresh the CA list and the corresponding CRLs. Default is \nnot\n to refresh, unless the admin requests it by specifying this option.\n\n\n--version\n Prints the version of the \nosg-ca-manage\n tool.\n\n\n--help | --usage\n Print usage information. Show a brief explanatory text for using osg-ca-manage.\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of commands\n\n\nExactly one command is to be specified during an execution of osg-ca-manage\n\n\nStatus commands\n\n\n\n\nshowCAURL\n This will print out the distribution location specified in the config file. This command will read osg-update-certs.conf and output cacerts_url.\n\n\nlistCA [--pattern \npattern\n]\n This command will use openssl x509 command on the files in the --dir to provide hash, the subject and whether a CA is IGTF or TeraGrid accredited and distribution package which was used to download CAs into the directory. --verbose option will provide additional information like issuer (of CA) and all associated dates (CA cert issuance date, and CRL issuance date, and expiry dates). The command will look for CA files in the -certDir. The \npattern\n specified in the option will be matched, using perl regex, against the subject field of the certificate (but we might also expand it include issuer if needed) and all CAs are listed if no pattern is given.\n\n\nverify [--hash \nCA_hash\n | --pattern \npattern\n]\n The verify command will check all CAs (or if specified only the \nCA_hash\n) in the \ncertDir\n directory, to see if any CA/CRL have expired or are about to do so. If any expired CA/CRL are found, an error is issued along with the hash, date when CA cert/CRL expired. A warning is issued if either the CA cert or CRL is about the expire within the next 24 Hrs. The --verbose option provides the CA Name, date the CA certs and CRL files are created (by the CA), and when they will expire. In addition to hash value we will also consider providing an option of verify using \npattern\n \n\n\ndiffCAPackage\n This command will compare the hash of certificates included in the certificate directory against the latest OSG distribution (based on your \ncacerts_url\n) and outputs the difference. \n\n\nshow [--certfile \ncert_file\n | --hash \nCA_hash\n]\n This command will essentially provide a condensed output of openssl x509 command. --verbose option will provide the full output. If --hash option is used we will look for the \nCA_hash\n.o\n file in the \ncertDir\n. The --certfile option can also take in a user proxy. \n\n\nshowChain [--certfile \ncert_file\n | --hash \nCA_hash\n]\n This command will output the trust chain of the certificate. \ncertDir\n will be used as the directory in which search for ancestor certs will be conducted. This command can also be used to trace the trust chain of a user proxy.\n\n\n\n\nManage commands\n\n\n\n\nsetupCA --location \nroot|PATH\n [--url \nosg|igtf|URL\n --no-update --force]\n This command is used for the inital setup of the CA package. The CA package can be setup to download CAs from any URL. Keywords are provided for various distributions. For the location to specify, keywords are provided to install into 'root' (/etc/grid-security). A --no-update option is available. Setting this flag instructs just setup the symlinks only and not to run configure osg-update-certs to be run automatically. This option is for installations that will not manage their own certificates, but will rely on updates through another method (such as RPM, or using osg-update-certs from a different OSG installation). A common use case for this is to have worker-node installations rely on the CA certificates being available on an NFS share, and the updating will happen on a single node.\n\n\nrefreshCA\n This command run osg-update-certs to check for a new version of the CA distribution. If you already have the latest version, but wish to force an update anyways, use the --force option. 1.\nfetchCRL\n It retrieves CRLs for all CAs within the directory. This will involve invoking fetch-crl, with appropriate arguments. NOTE: If the OSG's 's fetch-crl service has not been enabled, then this command will not execute. This is a safety mechanism to prevent crls from being downloaded using this tool if they are not scheduled to be updated.\n\n\nsetCAURL [--url \nosg|igtf|URL\n]\n This command sets the location from where the CA files. This command will modify vdt-update-certs.conf and set the cacerts_url as \nURL_location\n. Only if --auto-refresh is specified both CA and CRLs are refreshed once the URL change has been made. The distribution \nURL_location\n will be required to conform to the CA distribution format (e.g. similar to \nhttps://repo.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version-igtf-new\n). If the \nURL_location\n cannot be reached or if it is valid syntactically (i.e. does not conform to the format requirements) a warning will be issues and no changes will be made. The --force option can be used to force a change ignoring the warning. If URL location is left unspecified the \nURL_location\n will be set to OSG default. We define keywords for OSG, IGTF as shortcuts for OSG wide well-known CA URL_locations.\n\n\nadd [--cadir \nlocaldir\n | --caname \nCA\n]\n The --hash argument is required. If --dir is not specified we will assume that the user wants to include a CA he has previously excluded and will remove the corresponding exclude lines from the config. If \nCA_hash\n is not known to us or it is already included we will provide appropriate error/warning information. In the common case this command will add include lines for \nlocal_dir\n/\nCA_hash\n.0, into the vdt-update-certs.conf file. Lastly the command will invoke functions refresh the CAs and fetch CRLs. This command will also do some preliminary error checks, e.g. make sure that \u201c.0\u201d, \u201c.crl_url\u201d, \u201c.signing_policy\u201d files exist and that --dir is different than --certDir.\n\n\nremove [--cadir \nlocaldir\n | --caname \nCA\n]\n This command will be complementary to add and would either add an exclude or remove an include depending on the scenario. This command will also refresh CA and CRLs. vdt-update-certs do the job of removing cert files, we will still do the preliminary error checks to make sure that the certs that are being removed are included in the first place. For both addCA and removeCA, new CAs will be included/removed and CRLs will be refreshed only if --auto-refresh is set.\n\n\n\n\nUsage Examples\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThese commands will not work if of the osg-ca-certs (or igtf-ca-certs) RPM packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\nInstall a Certificate Authority Package\n\n\nBefore you proceed to install a Certificate Authority Package you should decide which of the available packages to install.\n\n\n\n\nosg\n, the package recommended to be used by production resources on the OSG.

It works in two modes:   CSR is provided by the user: the CSR provided is sent to the OIM.  CSR is not provided by the user: the script generates a private key for the user. Writes it to default key file name or the one specified by  -o .   This script:   Generates a new host private key and CSR (the only important part of CSR is  CN= HOSTNAME  component).

If the user certificate is renewed, the user gets email notification regarding the same and the renewed certificate is saved by the name of the existing certificate suffixed by  -renewed.pem  (e.g. when we renew  my-cert.pem , the renewed certificate is named  my-cert-renewed.pem ).  Inputs:   path to user's certificate (optional: default is path specified by  $X509_USER_CERT  environment variable, then  ~/.globus/usercert.pem ).  path to user's private key (optional: default is path specified by  $X509_USER_KEY  environment variable, then  ~/.globus/userkey.pem ).  Passphrase for user's private key via non-echoing prompt.  User needs to provide VO name if the requested hostname has multiple VO's assigned   Outputs:   On Renewal, the renewed certificate is stored with the filename of the older user certificate suffixed with  -renewed.pem .  The certificate name for renewed certificate is sent to  stdout .    Note  If the retrieval of user certificate fails for some reason, the user can download the renewed certificate from OIM web interface using the following URL (where  REQID  is the request ID number for the user certificate on OIM):  https://oim.opensciencegrid.org/oim/certificateuser?id= REQID    root@host #  osg-user-cert-renew --help Usage: osg-user-cert-renew [options]  Options:    -h, --help            show this help message and exit    -k PKEY, --pkey=PKEY  Specify Requestor s private key (PEM Format).

For the location to specify, keywords are provided to install into 'root' (/etc/grid-security). A --no-update option is available. Setting this flag instructs just setup the symlinks only and not to run configure osg-update-certs to be run automatically. This option is for installations that will not manage their own certificates, but will rely on updates through another method (such as RPM, or using osg-update-certs from a different OSG installation). A common use case for this is to have worker-node installations rely on the CA certificates being available on an NFS share, and the updating will happen on a single node.  refreshCA  This command run osg-update-certs to check for a new version of the CA distribution. If you already have the latest version, but wish to force an update anyways, use the --force option. 1. fetchCRL  It retrieves CRLs for all CAs within the directory. This will involve invoking fetch-crl, with appropriate arguments. NOTE: If the OSG's 's fetch-crl service has not been enabled, then this command will not execute. This is a safety mechanism to prevent crls from being downloaded using this tool if they are not scheduled to be updated.  setCAURL [--url  osg|igtf|URL ]  This command sets the location from where the CA files. This command will modify vdt-update-certs.conf and set the cacerts_url as  URL_location . Only if --auto-refresh is specified both CA and CRLs are refreshed once the URL change has been made. The distribution  URL_location  will be required to conform to the CA distribution format (e.g. similar to  https://repo.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version-igtf-new ). If the  URL_location  cannot be reached or if it is valid syntactically (i.e. does not conform to the format requirements) a warning will be issues and no changes will be made. The --force option can be used to force a change ignoring the warning. If URL location is left unspecified the  URL_location  will be set to OSG default. We define keywords for OSG, IGTF as shortcuts for OSG wide well-known CA URL_locations.  add [--cadir  localdir  | --caname  CA ]  The --hash argument is required.

If  CA_hash  is not known to us or it is already included we will provide appropriate error/warning information. In the common case this command will add include lines for  local_dir / CA_hash .0, into the vdt-update-certs.conf file. Lastly the command will invoke functions refresh the CAs and fetch CRLs. This command will also do some preliminary error checks, e.g. make sure that \u201c.0\u201d, \u201c.crl_url\u201d, \u201c.signing_policy\u201d files exist and that --dir is different than --certDir.  remove [--cadir  localdir  | --caname  CA ]  This command will be complementary to add and would either add an exclude or remove an include depending on the scenario. This command will also refresh CA and CRLs. vdt-update-certs do the job of removing cert files, we will still do the preliminary error checks to make sure that the certs that are being removed are included in the first place.

It assumes you understand \nYUM/RPM Basics\n.\n\n\nInstall yum-priorities\n\n\nWe use \nyum\n priorities to ensure that we get the right packages from the OSG repositories. Please install it:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install yum-priorities\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is \ngood documentation\n in the wild about yum priorities, but we'll summarize the essential bits for you.\n\n\nThe basic idea of yum priorities is that if a package is found in two repositories, priorities will influence how yum chooses which package to install. We want the OSG software repository to be chosen instead of the EPEL repository so software, such as Globus, comes from our repository instead of the EPEL repository. (This is important because you will have installation errors if you get the EPEL Globus.)\n\n\nYum priorities is a \nyum plugin\n. Once enabled, you can set the priority of each repository (located in /etc/yum.repos.d) The lower the numerical priority, the better the priority. The default priority for a repository when it's not specified is 99. We set the priority for the OSG repository to be 98, as you can see here:\n\n\nroot@host # cat /etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo\n[osg]\nname=OSG Software for Enterprise Linux 5 - $basearch\nmirrorlist=http://repo.grid.iu.edu/mirror/osg-release/$basearch\nfailovermethod=priority\npriority=\n98\n\nenabled=0\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-OSG\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can adjust these priorities if you have special needs at your site.\n\n\nAutomatic Updates\n\n\nWe strongly recommend against automatic updates for production services. You want to only change software versions during a controlled downtime (or, at least, while a human is watching); we strive to thoroughly test software updates, but cannot guarantee new version of software will not be problematic for your site.\n\n\nFor testbeds, automatic updates are suggested.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nSometimes when installing, you will get an error like this:\n\n\nhttp://ftp1.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/54/x86_64/updates/security/repodata/filelists.sqlite.bz2: \n[\nErrno -1\n]\n Metadata file does not match checksum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis often indicates that you have out of date information, cached by \nyum\n. The following command will clear the out of date information, and you can try again:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum --enablerepo\n=\n*\n clean all\n\n\n\n\n\nConsiderations for Large Sites\n\n\nWhile \nyum\n is a wonderful tool for installing software on a single server, it's a poor tool to install the same version of the software on many hosts. We \nstrongly\n recommend a cluster management tool; as far as we know, all cluster management tools provide a mechanism to create a local yum repository and have all your worker nodes use that.\n\n\nIf you have more than 20 worker nodes, we have the following advice:\n\n\n\n\nDo \nnot\n use one of the OSG repositories directly for worker node installations; build a local mirror instead. (See below).\n\n\nDistribute CRLs to the worker nodes using an HTTP proxy.\n\n\n\n\nBoth items are covered in this document.\n\n\nIn the future, we will be providing a mechanism for distributing CAs and CRLs via a shared file system; this is not quite finished. If you choose to do this, remember that your security infrastructure will only be as safe and reliable as the shared filesystem!\n\n\nRepository Mirrors\n\n\nA local yum mirror allows you to reduce the amount of external bandwidth used when updating or installing packages.\n\n\nAdd the following to a file in \n/etc/cron.d\n:\n\n\nRANDOM\n * * * * root rsync -aH rsync://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/ /var/www/html/osg/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr, to mirror only a single repository:\n\n\nRANDOM\n * * * * root rsync -aH rsync://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/\nOSG_RELEASE\n/el6/development /var/www/html/osg/\nOSG_RELEASE\n/el6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nRANDOM\n with a number between 0 and 59.\n\n\nReplace \nOSG_RELEASE\n with the OSG release you want to use (e.g. '3.3', or '3.4').\n\n\nOn your worker node, you can replace the \nbaseurl\n line of \n/etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo\n with the appropriate URL for your mirror.\n\n\nIf you are interested in having your mirror be part of the OSG's default set of mirrors, \nplease file a GOC ticket\n.\n\n\nCA Certificate Installation Considerations\n\n\nCAs are distributed in two ways:\n\n\n\n\nAs an RPM that contains the set of CAs.

Support will be removed by March 2018.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the above CAs, you can install other CAs via RPM. These only work with the RPMs that provide CAs (that is, \nosg-ca-certs\n and the like, but not \nosg-ca-scripts\n.) They are in addition to the above RPMs, so do not only install these extra CAs.\n\n\n| \nSet of CAs\n | \nRPM name\n     | \nInstallation command (as root)\n |\n|----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|\n| cilogon-openid | cilogon-ca-certs | \nyum install cilogon-ca-certs\n     |\n\n\nManaging Certificate Revocation Lists\n\n\nIn addition to CA certificates, you normally need to have updated Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) which are are lists of certificates that have been revoked for any reason. Software in the OSG Software Stack uses these to ensure that you are talking to valid clients or servers.\n\n\nWe use a tool named \nfetch-crl\n that periodically updates the CRLs. Fetch CRL is a utility that updates Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). These are lists of certificates that were granted by the CA, but have since been revoked. It is good practice to regularly update the CRL list for each CA to ensure that you do not authenticate any certificate that has been revoked.\n\n\nfetch-crl\n is installed as two different system services. The fetch-crl-boot service runs only\nat boot time. The \nfetch-crl-cron\n service runs \nfetch-crl\n every 6 hours (with a random sleep\ntime included) by default. Both services are disabled by default. At the very minimum, the\n\nfetch-crl-cron\n service needs to be enabled otherwise services will begin to fail as the\nexisting CRLs expire.\n\n\nInstall \nfetch-crl\n\n\nNormally \nfetch-crl\n is installed when you install the rest of the software and you do not need\nto specifically install it. If you do wish to install it, you can install it as:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install fetch-crl\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable and Start \nfetch-crl\n\n\nTo enable fetch-crl (fetch Certificate Revocation Lists) services by default on the node:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-boot on\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-cron on\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start fetch-crl:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service fetch-crl-boot start\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhile it is necessary to start \nfetch-crl-cron\n in order to have it active, \nfetch-crl-boot\n is started automatically at boot time if enabled. The start command will run \nfetch-crl-boot\n at the moment when it is invoked and it may take some time to complete.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure \nfetch-crl\n\n\nTo modify the times that fetch-crl-cron runs, edit \n/etc/cron.d/fetch-crl\n.\n\n\nBy default, \nfetch-crl\n connects directly to the remote CA; this is\ninefficient and potentially harmful if done simultaneously by many nodes\n(e.g. all the worker nodes of a big cluster). We recommend you provide a\nHTTP proxy (such as \nsquid\n) the worker nodes can utilize; OSG provides\n\npackaging of squid\n.\n\n\nTo configure fetch-crl to use an HTTP proxy server:\n\n\nCreate or edit the file \n/etc/fetch-crl.conf\n and add the following line:\n\n\nhttp_proxy\n=\nhttp://your.squid.fqdn:port\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, adjust the URL appropriately for your proxy server.\n\n\nNote that the \nnosymlinks\n option in the configuration files refers\nto ignoring links within the certificates directory (e.g. two different\nnames for the same file). It is perfectly fine if the path of the CA\ncertificates directory itself (\ninfodir\n) is a link to a directory.\n\n\nAny modifications to the configuration file will be preserved during an RPM update.\n\n\nCurrent versions of \nfetch-crl\n produce more output.\nIt is possible to send the output to syslog instead of the default email system. To do so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the configuration file to enable syslog:\n\n\nlogmode = syslog\nsyslogfacility = daemon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the file \n/var/log/daemon\n exists, e.g. touching the file\n\n\n\n\nChange \n/etc/logrotate.d\n files to rotate it\n\n\n\n\nStart/Stop fetch-crl: A quick guide\n\n\nYou need to fetch the latest CA Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and you should enable the fetch-crl service to keep the CRLs up to date:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /usr/sbin/fetch-crl \n# This fetches the CRLs\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service fetch-crl-boot start\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron start\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable the \nfetch-crl\n service to keep the CRLs up to date after reboots:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-boot on\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-cron on\n\n\n\n\n\nTo stop \nfetch-crl\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service fetch-crl-boot stop\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron stop\n\n\n\n\n\nTo disable the fetch-crl service:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-boot off\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-cron off\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating CAs/CRLs\n\n\nWhy maintain up-to-date Trusted CA /CRL information\n\n\nThe Trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates, and their associated Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), are used for every transaction on a resource that establishes an authenticated network connection based on end user\u2019s certificate. In order for the authentication to succeed, the user\u2019s certificate must have been issued by one of the CAs in the Trusted CA directory, and the user\u2019s certificate must not be listed in the CRL for that CA.\n\n\nCRLs can be thought of as a black list of certificates. CAs are the trust authorities, similar to DMV that issues you the driving license. (Another way of thinking CRLs is the do-not-fly lists at the airports. if your certificate shows up in CRLs, you are not allowed access.)\n\n\nThis is handled at the certificate validation stage even before the authorization check (which will provide the mapping of an authenticated user to a local account UID/GID). So you do not need to do worry about it; the grid software will do this for you.\n\n\nHowever, you should make sure that your site has the most up-to-date list of Trusted CAs. There are multiple trust authorities in OSG (think of it as a different DMV for each state). If you do not have an up-to-date list of CAs it is possible that some of your users transactions at your site will start to fail. A current CRL list for each CA is also necessary, since without one transactions for users of that CA will fail.\n\n\nHow to ensure you are get up-to-date CA/CRL information\n\n\n\n\nIf you installed CAs using rpm packages (\nosg-ca-certs\n,\nigtf-ca-certs\n) (Options 1, 4), you will need to install the software described in \nthe CA update document\n, and enable \nosg-ca-certs-updater\n service to keep the CAs automatically updated. If you do not install the updater, you will have to regularly run yum update to keep the CAs updated.\n\n\n\n\nIf you use Option 2 (i.e. \nosg-update-certs\n) then make sure that you have the corresponding service enabled.\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service osg-update-certs-cron  status\n\nPeriodic osg-update-certs is enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that fetch-crl cron is enabled\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron  status\n\nPeriodic fetch-crl is enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nUseful configuration and log files\n\n\nConfiguration files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll CA Packages\n\n\nCA File Location\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll CA Packages\n\n\nIndex files\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/certificates/INDEX.html\n or \n/etc/grid-security/certificates/INDEX.txt\n\n\nLatest version also available at \nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/pacman/cadist/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll CA Packages\n\n\nChange Log\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/certificates/CHANGES\n\n\nLatest version also available at \nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/pacman/cadist/CHANGES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-certs or igtf-ca-certs\n\n\ncontain only CA files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts\n\n\nConfiguration File for osg-update-certs\n\n\n/etc/osg/osg-update-certs.conf\n\n\nThis file may be edited by hand, though it is recommended to use osg-ca-manage to set configuration parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfetch-crl-3.x\n\n\nConfiguration file\n\n\n/etc/fetch-crl.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe index and change log files contain a summary of all the CA distributed and their version.\n\n\nLogs files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts\n\n\nLog file of osg-update-certs\n\n\n/var/log/osg-update-certs.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts\n\n\nStdout of osg-update-certs\n\n\n/var/log/osg-ca-certs-status.system.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts\n\n\nStdout of osg-ca-manage\n\n\n/var/log/osg-ca-manage.system.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts\n\n\nStdout of initial CA setup\n\n\n/var/log/osg-setup-ca-certificates.system.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTests\n\n\nTo test the host certificate of a server \nopenssl s_client\n can be used.

For additional details what is in the current release, see the \ndistribution site\n and \nchange log\n.\n\n\nHow can I add or remove a particular CA file?\n\n\nAdd and remove of CA files are supported only if you CA files are being installed using \nosg-update-certs\n, which is included in the \nosg-ca-scripts\n package (option 2), for all other options no support for adding and removing a particular CA file is provided by OSG. The preferred approach to add or remove a CA is to use \nosg-ca-manage\n. For adding a new CA \nosg-ca-manage add [--dir \nlocal_dir\n] --hash \nCA_hash\n may be used, while a CA is removed using \nosg-ca-manage remove --hash \nCA_hash\n.\n\n\nAre there any log files or configuration files associated with CA certificate package?\n\n\nIf CA files are installed using \nosg-ca-certs\n or \nigtf-ca-certs\n rpms (i.e. options 1, 4) no log or configuration files are present.\n\n\nLog and configuration files are however present for \nosg-ca-scripts\n rpm package (option 2).\n\n\nConfig files: \n/etc/osg/osg-update-certs.conf\n Log files: \n/var/log/osg-update-certs.log\n, \n/var/log/osg-ca-certs-status.system.out\n, \n/var/log/osg-ca-manage.system.out\n, \n/var/log/osg-setup-ca-certificates.system.out\n\n\nAre CA packages automatically updated?\n\n\nIf CA files are installed using \nosg-ca-certs\n or \nigtf-ca-certs\n rpms (i.e. options 1, 4), you will need to install the software described in \nOSG CA certs updater\n, and enable \nosg-ca-certs-updater\n service to keep the CAs automatically updated.\n\n\nIf CA files are being installed using \nosg-ca-scripts\n rpm package (option 2), CA files are kept up-to-date as long as \nosg-update-certs-cron\n service the package provides has been started.\n\n\nHow do I manually update my CA package?\n\n\nFor Option 1: run one of the following \nyum update osg-ca-certs\n or \nyum update igtf-ca-certs\n depending on the rpm package you installed.\n\n\nFor Option 4: run \nyum update osg-ca-certs\n\n\nFor Option 2: You do not need to do a manual update, make sure \nosg-update-certs-cron\n is enabled using\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service osg-update-certs-cron  status\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the service is disabled, enable it using\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service osg-update-certs-cron  start\n\n\n\n\n\nIf for some extraordinary reason you need to manually update the CA you could run \nosg-ca-manage [--force] refreshCA\n.\n\n\nWhere are the configuration files for fetch-crl?\n\n\n/etc/fetch-crl.conf\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSome guides on x509 certificates:\n\n\n\n\nUseful commands: \nhttp://security.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/grid-howtos/usefulopenssl.html\n\n\nInstall GSI authentication on a server: \nhttp://security.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/wssec/gsihttps/\n\n\nCertificates how-to: \nhttp://www.nordugrid.org/documents/certificate_howto.html\n\n\n\n\nSome examples about verifying the certificates:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://gagravarr.org/writing/openssl-certs/others.shtml\n\n\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/test-ssl-certificates-diagnosis-ssl-certificate/\n\n\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/debugging-ssl-communications-from-unix-shell-prompt.html\n\n\n\n\nRelated software:\n\n\n\n\nDescription, manual and examples of \nosg-ca-manage\n\n\nosg-ca-certs-updater",

When installing software the CAs, we provide a few mechanisms in order to allow you to make informed decisions.\nYou might ask \"why do I care? Can\u2019t you just give them to me?\"  A few reasons why you may want to be involved:   What set of CA certificates do you want? How much control do you want over the set of CA certificates?\n    Some sites might not want to install specific CAs for policy or security reasons.  How do you want to update them?  Do you want to centrally manage the CA certificates or install them on each computer at your site?   You have four options for installing CA certificates:   Install an RPM for a specific set of CA certificates.  Install  osg-update-certs , a program that lets you install/update a predefined set of CA certificates, then adjust the set by adding or deleting specific CAs.  Install an RPM that installs  no  CAs. This is useful when you want your RPM installations to succeed (because our RPMs require CA certificates, and this RPM satisfies that dependency) but you want to manage them with your own technique.

We recommend you provide a\nHTTP proxy (such as  squid ) the worker nodes can utilize; OSG provides packaging of squid .  To configure fetch-crl to use an HTTP proxy server:  Create or edit the file  /etc/fetch-crl.conf  and add the following line:  http_proxy = http://your.squid.fqdn:port   Again, adjust the URL appropriately for your proxy server.

In order for the authentication to succeed, the user\u2019s certificate must have been issued by one of the CAs in the Trusted CA directory, and the user\u2019s certificate must not be listed in the CRL for that CA.  CRLs can be thought of as a black list of certificates. CAs are the trust authorities, similar to DMV that issues you the driving license. (Another way of thinking CRLs is the do-not-fly lists at the airports. if your certificate shows up in CRLs, you are not allowed access.)  This is handled at the certificate validation stage even before the authorization check (which will provide the mapping of an authenticated user to a local account UID/GID). So you do not need to do worry about it; the grid software will do this for you.  However, you should make sure that your site has the most up-to-date list of Trusted CAs. There are multiple trust authorities in OSG (think of it as a different DMV for each state). If you do not have an up-to-date list of CAs it is possible that some of your users transactions at your site will start to fail. A current CRL list for each CA is also necessary, since without one transactions for users of that CA will fail.",

Currently, OSG software is supported under the OpenJDK\u00a07 implementation. Other implementations (such as the Oracle JDK) may also work, but there is considerable risk in using one; for instance, the IBM implementation is known to cause failures in most OSG Java software.\n\n\nThis document explains how to install Java for OSG software components in a way that allows other Java implementations to be present on a system. If you want to remove all other Java implementations besides the supported OpenJDK\u00a07, there are optional instructions for doing so. This document is only about installing Java as a preliminary step for other OSG software installations; other OSG install guides refer to this document when necessary.\n\n\nInstalling Java\n\n\nOSG strongly recommends installing OpenJDK\u00a07 as the primary Java implementation on each OSG host that needs Java. Instructions for doing so are below. If you have specific technical reasons to install or use an alternate, unsupported Java implementation, there are separate instructions for doing so. Choose one of the following subsections based on your needs.\n\n\nInstalling OpenJDK 7 for OSG software\n\n\nTo install OpenJDK\u00a07 as the primary Java implementation on an OSG host:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove any conflicting symbolic links from an Oracle JDK installation (will not break Oracle JDK) \n\n\nroot@host #\n rm -f /usr/bin/java /usr/bin/javac /usr/bin/javadoc /usr/bin/jar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall OpenJDK\u00a07 and OSG Java\u00a07 package compatability layer \n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel osg-java7-compat osg-java7-devel-compat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake OpenJDK the preferred Java runtime environment (JRE) \n\n\nroot@host #\n alternatives --config java Select \n`\njre-1.7.0-openjdk\n`\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that OpenJDK is the preferred JRE \n\n\nroot@host #\n java -version The version number should start with \n`\n1\n.7\n`\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake OpenJDK the preferred Java development kit (JDK) \n\n\nroot@host #\n alternatives --config javac Select \n`\njava-1.7.0-openjdk\n`\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that OpenJDK is the preferred JDK \n\n\nroot@host #\n javac -version The version number should start with \n`\n1\n.7\n`\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling another Java implementation for OSG software\n\n\nUnless you have specific technical reasons otherwise, you should use OpenJDK\u00a07 for OSG Software; see the installation instructions above and skip this section. To install an alternate Java implementation as the primary Java implementation on an OSG host, use this section.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe IBM Java implementation (\njava-1.7.0-ibm\n or \njava-1.7.1-ibm\n) is known to cause severe failures in BeStMan 2 and GUMS (at least).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the Java implementation of your choice\n\n\nInstall the OSG Java\u00a07 package compatability layer \nroot@host #\n yum install osg-java7-compat osg-java7-devel-compat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake your Java implementation the preferred Java runtime environment (JRE) \n\n\n:::console\nroot@host # alternatives --config java\n4.

To see whether the issue exists:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck for an Oracle Java installation \n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -q jdk\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this command outputs a specific RPM name and version (e.g., \njdk-1.7.0\n), then Oracle Java is installed and you should continue with the next step. Otherwise, there are no issues and you are done\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck for stale symbolic links \n\n\nroot@host #\n **file /usr/bin/java**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/usr/bin/java: symbolic link to `/etc/alternatives/java' If the output of the \nfile\n command above differs from the sample output \u2014 if \n/usr/bin/java\n does not exist, if it is not a symbolic link, or if it is a symbolic link to a different path \u2014 then your OpenJDK installation has issues and must be fixed; continue with the next repair procedure below. Otherwise, there are no issues and you are done\n\n\nTo fix the OpenJDK installation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove incorrect symbolic links: \n\n\nroot@host #\n rm -f /usr/bin/java /usr/bin/javac /usr/bin/javadoc /usr/bin/jar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReinstall OpenJDK to create the symbolic links: \n\n\nroot@host #\n yum reinstall java-1.7.0-openjdk java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake OpenJDK the preferred Java runtime environment (JRE): \n\n\nroot@host #\n alternatives --config java Select \n`\njre-1.7.0-openjdk\n`\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that OpenJDK is the preferred JRE: \n\n\nroot@host #\n java -version The version number should start with \n`\n1\n.7\n`\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake OpenJDK the preferred Java development kit (JDK): \n\n\nroot@host #\n alternatives --config javac Select \n`\njava-1.7.0-openjdk\n`\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that OpenJDK is the preferred JDK: \n\n\nroot@host #\n javac -version The version number should start with \n`\n1\n.7\n`\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixing Tomcat\n\n\nIf you have a pre-existing Tomcat installation, you must ensure that that it is using your preferred Java implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck if tomcat6 is installed: \n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -q tomcat6\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the RPM is installed, the command will output the specific RPM name and version. If there is no output: Tomcat is not installed, there is no issue, and you are done\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen \n/etc/sysconfig/tomcat6\n.\n\n\n\n\nCheck if there is a line setting \nJAVA_HOME\n and that line is uncommented. If so, change that line to: \nJAVA_HOME=\"/etc/alternatives/jre\" If not, then you do not need to do anything.\n\n\nDo the same check for \n/etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf\n.\n\n\nRestart the Tomcat service: \nroot@host #\n service tomcat6 restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixing BeStMan\n\n\nIf you have a pre-existing BeStMan installation, you must ensure that it is using your preferred Java implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck if any bestman2 packages are installed: \n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -qa \n|\n grep ^bestman2\n\n\n\n\n\nIf any bestman2 RPMs are installed, the command will output the specific names and versions. If there is no output: BeStMan is not installed, there is no issue, and you are done\n2.  Open \n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2\n.\n3.  Check if there is a line setting \nJAVA_HOME\n and that line is uncommented. If so, change that line to: \nJAVA_HOME=/etc/alternatives/java_sdk If not, then you do not need to do anything.\n4.  Restart the BeStMan service: \n\n\nroot@host #\n service bestman2 restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixing SSL problems / Disabling SSLv3\n\n\nWe have received reports that the latest version of Firefox (39.0) keeps users from being able to access the web UIs of GUMS, Gratia, or VOMS-Admin. Attempts to access will result in this error: \n\n\n      SSL received a weak ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key in Server Key Exchange handshake message.\n      (Error code: ssl_error_weak_server_ephemeral_dh_key)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis affects all known versions of OpenJDK 1.7.0.   The recommended workaround for this is server-side:\n\n\n\n\nFind the file: \n/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0-*/jre/lib/security/java.security\n\n\nFind the setting called \njdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms\n (or add it if missing)\n\n\nIf not already present, add \nSSLv3\n and \nDHE\n to the list\n\n\nIf using EL6, run \nservice tomcat6 restart\n. If using EL7, run \nservice tomcat restart\n\n\n\n\nThis will cause the webapp to use a different algorithm, which Firefox will not complain about.   We do not have an ETA for when a future version of OpenJDK 1.7.0 will contain a fix. OpenJDK 1.8.0 does not have this problem, but since we have not verified that it works with OSG software, we do not recommend switching to that yet. \n\n\nOptional: Preventing Oracle JDK From Being Installed\n\n\nTo prevent Oracle's java implementation from being installed, you can configure yum to exclude it from all future installs: Edit \n/etc/yum.conf\n and add the line \nexclude=jdk java-1.6.0-sun-compat\n to the end of the file. If a line starting with \nexclude=\n already exists in \n/etc/yum.conf\n, then add \njdk\n and \njava-1.6.0-sun-compat\n to the end of that line, separated by spaces.\n\n\nGetting Help with Java and OSG Software\n\n\nFor further assistance please use \nthis page\n.",

Normally, all modules are run when calling \nosg-configure\n.\nHowever, it is possible to run specific modules separately.\nTo see a list of modules, including whether they can be run separately, run:\n\n\n[root@server] osg-configure -l\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the module can be run separately, specify it with the \n-m \nMODULE\n option:\n\n\n[root@server] osg-configure -c -m \nMODULE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions may be specified in multiple INI files, which may make it hard to determine which value OSG-Configure uses.\nYou may query the final value of an option via one of these methods:\n\n\n[root@server] osg-configure -o \nOPTION\n\n\n[root@server] osg-configure -o \nSECTION\n.\nOPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogs are written to \n/var/log/osg/osg-configure.log\n.\nIf something goes wrong, specify the \n-d\n flag to add more verbose output to \nosg-configure.log\n.\n\n\nThe rest of this document will detail what to specify in the INI files.\n\n\nConventions\n\n\nIn the tables below:\n\n\n\n\nMandatory options for a section are given in \nbold\n type. Sometime the default value may be OK and no edit required, but the variable has to be in the file.\n\n\nOptions that are not found in the default ini file are in \nitalics\n.\n\n\n\n\nSyntax and layout\n\n\nThe configuration files used by \nosg-configure\n are the one supported by Python's \nSafeConfigParser\n, similar in format to the \nINI configuration file\n used by MS Windows:\n\n\n\n\nConfig files are separated into sections, specified by a section name in square brackets (e.g. \n[Section 1]\n)\n\n\nOptions should be set using \nname = value\n pairs\n\n\nLines that begin with \n;\n or \n#\n are comments\n\n\nLong lines can be split up using continutations: each white space character can be preceded by a newline to fold/continue the field on a new line (same syntax as specified in \nemail RFC 822\n)\n\n\nVariable substitutions are supported -- \nsee below\n\n\n\n\nosg-configure\n reads and uses all of the files in \n/etc/osg/config.d\n that have a \".ini\" suffix. The files in this directory are ordered with a numeric prefix with higher numbers being applied later and thus having higher precedence (e.g. 00-foo.ini has a lower precedence than 99-local-site-settings.ini). Configuration sections and options can be specified multiple times in different files. E.g. a section called \n[PBS]\n can be given in \n20-pbs.ini\n as well as \n99-local-site-settings.ini\n.\n\n\nEach of the files are successively read and merged to create a final configuration that is then used to configure OSG software. Options and settings in files read later override the ones in previous files. This allows admins to create a file with local settings (e.g. \n99-local-site-settings.ini\n) that can be read last and which will be take precedence over the default settings in configuration files installed by various RPMs and which will not be overwritten if RPMs are updated.\n\n\nVariable substitution\n\n\nThe osg-configure parser allows variables to be defined and used in the configuration file:\nany option set in a given section can be used as a variable in that section.  Assuming that you have set an option with the name \nmyoption\n in the section, you can substitute the value of that option elsewhere in the section by referring to it as \n%(myoption)s\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe trailing \ns\n is required. Also, option names cannot have a variable subsitution in them.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Settings\n\n\nIf a setting is set to UNAVAILABLE or DEFAULT or left blank, osg-configure will try to use a sensible default for setting if possible.\n\n\nIgnore setting\n\n\nThe \nenabled\n option, specifying whether a service is enabled or not, is a boolean but also accepts \nIgnore\n as a possible value. Using Ignore, results in the service associated with the section being ignored entirely (and any configuration is skipped). This differs from using \nFalse\n (or the \n%(disabled)s\n variable), because using \nFalse\n results in the service associated with the section being disabled. \nosg-configure\n will not change the configuration of the service if the \nenabled\n is set to \nIgnore\n.\n\n\nThis is useful, if you have a complex configuration for a given that can't be set up using the ini configuration files. You can manually configure that service by hand editing config files, manually start/stop the service and then use the \nIgnore\n setting so that \nosg-configure\n does not alter the service's configuration and status.\n\n\nConfiguration sections\n\n\nThe OSG configuration is divided into sections with each section starting with a section name in square brackets (e.g. \n[Section 1]\n). The configuration is split in multiple files and options form one section can be in more than one files.\n\n\nThe following sections give an overview of the options for each of the sections of the configuration files that \nosg-configure\n uses.\n\n\nBosco\n\n\nThis section is contained in \n/etc/osg/config.d/20-bosco.ini\n which is provided by the \nosg-configure-bosco\n RPM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nValues Accepted\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenabled\n\n\nTrue\n, \nFalse\n, \nIgnore\n\n\nThis indicates whether the Bosco jobmanager is being used or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusers\n\n\nString\n\n\nA comma separated string.

A \nsubcluster\n is a homogeneous set of worker node hardware; a \nresource\n is a set of subcluster(s) with common capabilities that will be reported to the ATLAS AGIS system.\n\n\nAt least one Subcluster or Resource Entry section\n is required on a CE; please populate the information for all your subclusters. This information will be reported to a central collector and will be used to send GlideIns / pilot jobs to your site; having accurate information is necessary for OSG jobs to effectively use your resources.\n\n\nThis section is contained in \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-gip.ini\n which is provided by the \nosg-configure-gip\n RPM.

            "text": "GlideinWMS VO Frontend Installation\n\n\nAbout This Document\n\n\nThis document describes how to install the Glidein Workflow Managment System (GlideinWMS) VO Frontend for use with the OSG glidein factory. This software is the minimum requirement for a VO to use glideinWMS.\n\n\nThis document assumes expertise with Condor and familiarity with the glideinWMS software. It \ndoes not\n cover anything but the simplest possible install. Please consult the \nGlidein WMS reference documentation\n for advanced topics, including non-\nroot\n, non-RPM-based installation.\n\n\nThis document covers three components of the GlideinWMS a VO needs to install:\n\n\n\n\nUser Pool Collectors\n: A set of \ncondor_collector\n processes. Pilots submitted by the factory will join to one of these collectors to form a Condor pool.\n\n\nUser Pool Schedd\n: A \ncondor_schedd\n. Users may submit Condor vanilla universe jobs to this schedd; it will run jobs in the Condor pool formed by the \nUser Pool Collectors\n.\n\n\nGlidein Frontend\n: The frontend will periodically query the \nUser Pool Schedd\n to determine the desired number of running job slots. If necessary, it will request the factory to launch additional pilots.\n\n\n\n\nThis guide covers installation of all three components on the same host: it is designed for small to medium VOs (see the Hardware Requirements below). Given a significant, large host, we have been able to scale the single-host install to 20,000 running jobs.\n\n\n\n\nRelease\n\n\nThis document reflects glideinWMS v3.2.17.\n\n\nHow to get Help?\n\n\nTo get assistance about the OSG software please use \nthis page\n.\n\n\nFor specific questions about the Frontend configuration (and how to add it in your HTCondor infrastructure) you can email the glideinWMS support \n\n\nTo request access the OSG Glidein Factory (e.g. the UCSD factory) you have to send an email to \n (see below).\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nHost and OS\n\n\n\n\nA host to install the GlideinWMS Frontend (pristine node).\n\n\nOS is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and variants (see \ndetails\n). Currently most of our testing has been done on Scientific Linux 6.\n\n\nRoot access\n\n\n\n\nThe Glidein WMS VO Frontend has the following hardware requirements for a production host:\n\n\n\n\nCPU\n: Four cores, preferably no more than 2 years old.\n\n\nRAM\n: 3GB plus 2MB per running job. For example, to sustain 2000 running jobs, a host with 5GB is needed.\n\n\nDisk\n: 30GB will be plenty sufficient for all the binaries, config and log files related to glideinWMS. As this will be an interactive submit host, plan enough disk space for your users' jobs. Depending on your workflow, this might require 2MB to 2GB per job in a workflow.\n\n\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nThe Glidein WMS Frontend installation will create the following users unless they are already created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\n\nDefault uid\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napache\n\n\n48\n\n\nRuns httpd to provide the monitoring page (installed via dependencies).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor\n\n\nnone\n\n\nCondor user (installed via dependencies).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrontend\n\n\nnone\n\n\nThis user runs the glideinWMS VO frontend. It also owns the credentials forwarded to the factory to use for the glideins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngratia\n\n\nnone\n\n\nRuns the Gratia probes to collect accounting data (optional see \nthe Gratia section below\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nUID 48 is reserved by RedHat for user \napache\n.  If it is already taken by a different username, you will experience errors.\n\n\n\n\nCredentials and Proxies\n\n\nThe VO Frontend will use two credentials in its interactions with the the other glideinWMS services. At this time, these will be proxy files.\n\n\n\n\nthe \nVO Frontend proxy\n (used to authenticate with the other glideinWMS services).\n\n\none or more glideinWMS \npilot proxies\n (used/delegated to the factory services and submitted on the glideinWMS pilot jobs).\n\n\n\n\nThe \nVO Frontend proxy\n and the \n pilot proxy\n can be the same. By default, the VO Frontend will run as user \nfrontend\n (UID is machine dependent) so these proxies must be owned by the user \nfrontend\n.\n\n\nVO Frontend proxy\n\n\nThe use of a service certificate is recommended. Then you create a proxy from the certificate as explained in the \nproxy configuration section\n. This can be a plain grid proxy (from \ngrid-proxy-init\n), no VO extensions are required.\n\n\nYou must notify the Factory operation of the DN of this proxy when you initially setup the frontend and each time the DN changes\n.\n\n\nPilot proxies\n\n\nThis proxy is used by the factory to submit the glideinWMS pilot jobs. Therefore, they must be authorized to access to the CEs (factory entry points) where jobs are submitted. There is no need to notify the Factory operation about the DN of this proxy (neither at the initial registration nor for subsequent changes). This second proxy has no special requirement or controls added by the factory but will probably require VO attributes because of the CEs: if you are able to use this proxy to submit jobs to the CEs where the Factory runs glideinWMS pilots for you, then the proxy is OK. You can test your proxy using \nglobusrun\n or HTCondor-G\n\n\nTo check the important information about a pem certificate you can use: \nopenssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -subject -issuer -dates -noout\n. You will need that to find out information for the configuration files and the request to the GlideinWMS factory.\n\n\nCertificates/Proxies configuration example\n\n\nThis document has a \nproxy configuration section\n that uses the host certificate/key and a user certificate to generate the required proxies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\n\nUser that owns certificate\n\n\nPath to certificate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost certificate\n\n\nroot\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n            \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\n are instructions to request a host certificate.\n\n\nNetworking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService Name\n\n\nProtocol\n\n\nPort Number\n\n\nInbound\n\n\nOutbound\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor port range\n\n\ntcp\n\n\nLOWPORT, HIGHPORT\n\n\nYES\n\n\n\n\ncontiguous range of ports\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS Frontend\n\n\ntcp\n\n\n9618 to 9660\n\n\nYES\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor Collectors for the GlideinWMS Frontend (received ClassAds from resources and jobs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe VO frontend must have reliable network connectivity, be on the public internet (no NAT), and preferably with no firewalls. Each running pilot requires 5 outgoing TCP ports. Incoming TCP ports 9618 to 9660 must be open.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, 2000 running jobs require about 10,100 TCP connections. This will overwhelm many firewalls; if you are unfamiliar with your network topology, you may want to warn your network administrator.\n\n\n\n\nBefore the installation\n\n\nOnce all requirements are satisfied you must take a couple of actions before installing the Frontend:\n\n\n\n\nyou need all the data to connect to a GWMS Factory\n\n\nRemember to install HTCondor BEFORE installing the Frontend (\ninstructions are below\n)\n\n\n\n\nOSG Factory access\n\n\nBefore installing the Glidein WMS VO Frontend you need the information about a \nGlidein Factory\n that you can access:\n\n\n\n\n(recommended) OSG is managing a factory at UCSD and one at GOC and you can request access to them\n\n\nYou have another Glidein Factory that you can access\n\n\nYou \ninstall your own Glidein Factory\n\n\n\n\nTo request access to the OSG Glidein Factory at UCSD you have to send an email to \n providing:\n\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\nThe VO that is utilizing the VO Frontend\n\n\nThe DN of the proxy you will use to communicate with the Factory (VO Frontend DN, e.g. the host certificate subject if you follow the \nproxy configuration section\n)\n\n\nYou can propose a security name that will have to be confirmed/changed by the Factory managers (see below)\n\n\n\n\nA list of sites where you want to run:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour VO must be supported on those sites\n\n\n\n\nYou can provide a list or piggy back on existing lists, e.g. all the sites supported for the VO. Check with the Factory managers\n\n\nYou can start with one single site\n\n\n\n\nIn the reply from the OSG Factory managers you will receive some information needed for the configuration of your VO Frontend\n\n\n\n\nThe exact spelling and capitalization of your VO name. Sometime is different from what is commonly used, e.g. OSG VO is \"OSGVO\".\n\n\nThe host of the Factory Collector: \ngfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n\nThe DN os the factory, e.g. \n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n\nThe factory identity, e.g.: \ngfactory@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n\nThe identity on the factory you will be mapped to. Something like: \nusername@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n\nYour security name. A unique name, usually containing your VO name: \nMy_SecName\n\n\nA string to add in the main factory query_expr in the frontend configuration, e.g. \nstringListMember(\"\nVO\n\",GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)\n. From there you get the correct name of the VO (above in this list).\n\n\n\n\nInstallation Procedure\n\n\nRefer to installation of the \nCA certificates\n\n\nInstall HTCondor\n\n\nMost required software is installed from the Frontend RPM installation. You need to have HTCondor installed before installing the Glidein WMS Frontend. If yum cannot find a HTCondor RPM, it will install the dummy \nempty-condor\n RPM, assuming that you installed HTCondor using a tarball distribution.\n\n\nIf you don't have HTCondor already installed, you can install the HTCondor RPM from the OSG repository:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install condor.x86_64\n\n#\n If you have a \n32\n bit host use instead:\n\nroot@host #\n yum install condor.i386\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install the VO Frontend RPM\n\n\nThe RPM is available in the OSG repository:\n\n\nInstall the RPM and dependencies (be prepared for a lot of dependencies).\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install glideinwms-vofrontend\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will install the current production release verified and tested by OSG with default condor configuration. This command will install the glideinwms vofrontend, condor, the OSG client, and all the required dependencies all on one node.\n\n\nIf you wish to install a different version of GlideinWMS, add the \"--enablerepo\" argument to the command as follows:\n\n\n\n\nyum install --enablerepo=osg-testing glideinwms-vofrontend\n: The most recent production release, still in testing phase. This will usually match the current tarball version on the GlideinWMS home page. (The osg-release production version may lag behind the tarball release by a few weeks as it is verified and packaged by OSG). Note that this will also take the osg-testing versions of all dependencies as well.\n\n\nyum install --enablerepo=osg-contrib glideinwms-vofrontend\n: The most recent development series release, ie version 3 release. This has newer features such as cloud submission support, but is less tested.\n\n\n\n\nNote that these commands will install default condor configurations with all services on one node.\n\n\nAdvanced: Multi-node Installation\n\n\nFor advanced users requiring heavy usage on their submit node, you may want to consider splitting the usercollector, user submit, and vo frontend services.\n\n\nThis can be doing using the following three commands (on different machines):\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install glideinwms-vofrontend-standalone\n\nroot@host #\n yum install glideinwms-usercollector\n\nroot@host #\n yum install glideinwms-userschedd\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, you will need to perform the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nOn the vofrontend and userschedd, modify CONDOR_HOST to point to your usercollector. This is in \n/etc/condor/config.d/00_gwms_general.config\n. You can also override this value by placing it in a new config file. (For instance, \n/etc/condor/config.d/99_local_custom.config\n to avoid rpmsave/rpmnew conflicts on upgrades).\n\n\nIn \n/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile\n, you will need to all DNs for each machine (userschedd, usercollector, vofrontend). Take great care to escape all special characters. Alternatively, you can use the \nglidecondor_addDN\n to add these values.\n\n\nIn the \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n file, change the schedd locations to match the correct server. Also change the collectors tags at the bottom of the file. More details on frontend xml are in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade Procedure\n\n\nIf you have a working installation of glideinwms-frontend you can just upgrade the frontend rpms and skip the most of the configuration procedure below. These general upgrade instructions apply when upgrading the glideinwms-frontend rpm within same major versions.\n\n\n%\nRED%# Update the glideinwms-vofrontend packages\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update glideinwms\n\\*\n\n\n%\nRED%# Update the scripts in the working directory to the latest one\n\n\n%\nRED%# For RHEL \n7\n, CentOS \n7\n, and SL7\n\n\nroot@host #\n /usr/sbin/gwms-frontend upgrade\n\n%\nRED%# For RHEL \n6\n, CentOS \n6\n, and SL6\n\n\nroot@host #\n service gwms-frontend upgrade\n\n%\nRED%# Restart HTCondor because the configuration may be different\n\n\nroot@host #\n service condor restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \\*\n on the yum update is important.\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nWhen you do a generic yum update that will update also condor, the upgrade may restore the personal condor config file that you have to remove with \nrm /etc/condor/config.d/00personal_condor.config\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen upgrading to GlideinWMS 3.2.7 the second schedd is removed from the default configuration. For a smooth transition:\n\n\n\n\nremove from \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n the second schedd (the line containing \nschedd_jobs2@YOUR_HOST\n)\n\n\nreconfigure the frontend (\nservice gwms-frontend reconfig\n)\n\n\nrestart HTCondor (\nservice condor restart\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Procedure\n\n\nAfter installing the RPM, you need to configure the components of the glideinWMS VO Frontend:\n\n\n\n\nEdit Frontend configuration options\n\n\nEdit Condor configuration options\n\n\nCreate a Condor grid map file\n\n\nReconfigure and Start frontend\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Frontend\n\n\nThe VO Frontend configuration file is \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n. The next steps will describe each line that you will need to edit if you are using the OSG Factory at UCSD. The portions to edit are highlighted in red font. If you are using a different Factory more changes are necessary, please check the VO Frontend configuration reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe VO you are affiliated with. This will identify those CEs that the glideinWMS pilot will be authorized to run on using the \npilot proxy\n described previously in the this \nsection\n. Sometimes the whole \nquery_expr\n is provided to you by the factory (see Factory access above):\n\n\nfactory query_expr=\n((stringListMember(\nVO\n, GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactory collector information. The \nusername\n that you are assigned by the factory (also called the identity you will be mapped to on the factory, see above) . Note that if you are using a factory different than the production factory, you will have to change also \nDN\n, \nfactory_identity\n and \nnode\n attributes. (refer to the information provided to you by the factory operator):\n\n\ncollector DN=\n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n           comment=\nDefine factory collector globally for simplicity\n\n           factory_identity=\ngfactory@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n           my_identity=\nusername@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n           node=\ngfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend security information.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nclassad_proxy\n in the security entry is the location of the VO Frontend proxy described previously \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe \nproxy_DN\n is the DN of the \nclassad_proxy\n above.\n\n\nThe \nsecurity_name\n identifies this VO Frontend to the the Factory, It is provided by the factory operator.\n\n\nThe \nabsfname\n in the credential (or proxy in v 2.x) entry is the location of the glideinWMS \npilot\n proxy described in the requirements section \nhere\n. There can be multiple pilot proxies, or even other kind of keys (e.g. if you use cloud resources). \nThe type and trust_domain of the credential must match respectively auth_method and trust_domain used in the entry definition in the factory. If there is no match, between these two attributes in one of the credentials and some entry in one of the factories, then this frontend cannot trigger glideins.\n\nBoth the \nclassad_proxy\n and \nabsfname\n files should be owned by \nfrontend\n user.\n# These lines are from the configuration of v 3.x\n\nsecurity\n \nclassad_proxy=\n/tmp/vo_proxy\n \nproxy_DN=\nDN of vo_proxy\n\n      \nproxy_selection_plugin=\nProxyAll\n\n      \nsecurity_name=\nThe security name, this is used by factory\n\n      \nsym_key=\naes_256_cbc\n\n      \ncredentials\n\n        \ncredential\n \nabsfname=\n/tmp/pilot_proxy\n \nsecurity_class=\nfrontend\n\n        \ntrust_domain=\nOSG\n \ntype=\ngrid_proxy\n/\n\n      \n/credentials\n\n\n/security\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe schedd information.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nDN\n of the \nVO Frontend Proxy\n described previously \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe \nfullname\n attribute is the fully qualified domain name of the host where you installed the VO Frontend (\nhostname --fqdn\n).\n\n\n\n\nA secondary schedd is optional. You will need to delete the secondary schedd line if you are not using it. Multiple schedds allow the frontend to service requests from multiple submit hosts.\n\n\n   \nschedds\n\n     \nschedd\n \nDN=\nCert DN used by the schedd at fullname:\n\n           \nfullname=\nHostname of the schedd\n/\n\n      \nschedd\n \nDN=\nCert DN used by the second Schedd at fullname:\n\n            \nfullname=\nschedd name@Hostname of second schedd\n/\n\n   \n/schedds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe User Collector information.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nDN\n of the \nVO Frontend Proxy\n described previously \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe \nnode\n attribute is the full hostname of the collectors (\nhostname --fqdn\n) and port\n\n\nThe \nsecondary\n attribute indicates whether the element is for the primary or secondary collectors (True/False).\n\n\n\n\nThe default Condor configuration of the VO Frontend starts multiple Collector processes on the host (\n/etc/condor/config.d/11_gwms_secondary_collectors.config\n). The \nDN\n and \nhostname\n on the first line are the hostname and the host certificate of the VO Frontend. The \nDN\n and \nhostname\n on the second line are the same as the ones in the first one. The hostname (e.g. hostname.domain.tld) is filled automatically during the installation. The secondary collector ports can be defined as a range, e.g., 9620-9660).\n\n\n    \ncollector DN=\nDN of main collector\n\n           node=\nhostname.domain.tld:9618\n secondary=\nFalse\n/\n\n    \ncollector DN=\nDN of secondary collectors (usually same as DN in line above)\n\n           node=\nhostname.domain.tld:9620-9660\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe Frontend configuration includes many knobs, some of which are conflicting with a RPM installation where there is only one version of the Frontend installed and it uses well known paths.     Do not change the following in the Frontend configuration (you must leave the default values coming with the RPM installation):\n\n\n\n\nfrontend_versioning='False' (in the first line of XML, versioning is useful to install multiple tarball versions)\n\n\nwork base_dir must be /var/lib/gwms-frontend/vofrontend/ (other scripts like /etc/init.d/gwms-frontend count on that value)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a different Factory\n\n\nThe configuration above points to the OSG production Factory. If you are using a different Factory, then you have to:\n\n\n\n\nreplace \ngfactory@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n and \ngfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n with the correct values for your factory. And control also that the name used for the frontend () matches.\n\n\nmake sure that the factory is advertising the attributes used in the factory query expression (\nquery_expr\n).\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Condor\n\n\nThe condor configuration for the frontend is placed in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n.\n\n\n\n\n00_gwms_general.config\n\n\n01_gwms_collectors.config\n\n\n02_gwms_schedds.config\n\n\n03_gwms_local.config\n\n\n11_gwms_secondary_collectors.config\n\n\n90_gwms_dns.config\n\n\n\n\nGet rid of the pre-loaded condor default to avoid conflicts in the configuration.\n\n\nroot@host #\n rm /etc/condor/config.d/00personal_condor.config\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most installations create a new file named \n/etc/condor/config.d/92_local_condor.config\n\n\nUsing other Condor RPMs, e.g. UW Madison HTCondor RPM\n\n\nThe above procedure will work if you are using the OSG HTCondor RPMS. You can verify that you used the OSG HTCondor RPM by using \nyum list condor\n. The version name should include \"osg\", e.g. \n7.8.6-3.osg.el5\n.\n\n\nIf you are using the UW Madison Condor RPMS, be aware of the following changes:\n\n\n\n\nThis Condor RPM uses a file \n/etc/condor/condor_config.local\n to add your local machine slot to the user pool.\n\n\nIf you want to disable this behavior (recommended), you should blank out that file or comment out the line in \n/etc/condor/condor_config\n for LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE. (Make sure that LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR is set to \n/etc/condor/config.d\n)\n\n\nNote that the variable LOCAL_DIR is set differently in UW Madison and OSG RPMs. This should not cause any more problems in the glideinwms RPMs, but please take note if you use this variable in your job submissions or other customizations.\n\n\n\n\nIn general if you are using a non OSG RPM or if you added custom configuration files for HTCondor please check the order of the configuration files:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_config_val -config\n\nConfiguration source:\n\n\n    /etc/condor/condor_config\n\n\nLocal configuration sources:\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/00_gwms_general.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/01_gwms_collectors.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/02_gwms_schedds.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/03_gwms_local.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/11_gwms_secondary_collectors.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/90_gwms_dns.config\n\n\n%\nRED%/etc/condor/condor_config.local\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf, like in the example above, the GlideinWMS configuration files are not the last ones in the list please verify that important configuration options have not been overridden by the other configuration files.\n\n\nVerify your Condor configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe glideinWMS configuration files in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n should be the last ones in the list. If not, please verify that important configuration options have not been overridden by the other configuration files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the alll the expected HTCondor daemons are running:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_config_val -verbose DAEMON_LIST DAEMON_LIST: MASTER, COLLECTOR, NEGOTIATOR, SCHEDD, SHARED_PORT, COLLECTOR0\n\nCOLLECTOR1 COLLECTOR2 COLLECTOR3 COLLECTOR4 COLLECTOR5 COLLECTOR6 COLLECTOR7 COLLECTOR8 COLLECTOR9 COLLECTOR10 , COLLECTOR11, COLLECTOR12,\n\n\nCOLLECTOR13, COLLECTOR14, COLLECTOR15, COLLECTOR16, COLLECTOR17, COLLECTOR18, COLLECTOR19, COLLECTOR20, COLLECTOR21, COLLECTOR22, COLLECTOR23,\n\n\nCOLLECTOR24, COLLECTOR25, COLLECTOR26, COLLECTOR27, COLLECTOR28, COLLECTOR29, COLLECTOR30, COLLECTOR31, COLLECTOR32, COLLECTOR33, COLLECTOR34,\n\n\nCOLLECTOR35, COLLECTOR36, COLLECTOR37, COLLECTOR38, COLLECTOR39, COLLECTOR40\n\n\nDefined in \n/etc/condor/config.d/11_gwms_secondary_collectors.config\n, line 193.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't see all the collectors. shared port and the two schedd, then the configuration must be corrected. There should be \nno\n \nstartd\n daemons listed.\n\n\nCreate a Condor grid mapfile.\n\n\nThe Condor grid mapfile (\n/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile\n) is used for authentication between the glideinWMS pilot running on a remote worker node, and the local collector. Condor uses the mapfile to map certificates to pseudo-users on the local machine. It is important that you map the DN's of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach schedd proxy\n: The \nDN\n of each schedd that the frontend talks to. Specified in the frontend.xml schedd element \nDN\n attribute:\n\n\nschedds\n\n  \nschedd\n \nDN=\n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=YOUR_HOST\n \nfullname=\nYOUR_HOST\n/\n\n  \nschedd\n \nDN=\n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=YOUR_HOST\n \nfullname=\nschedd_jobs2@YOUR_HOST\n/\n\n\n/schedds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend proxy\n: The DN of the proxy that the frontend uses to communicate with the other glideinWMS services.

This allows the !glideinWMs pilot jobs to communicate with the User Collector. Specified in the frontend.xml proxy \nabsfname\n attribute (you need to specify the \nDN\n of each of those proxies:\n\n\nsecurity\n \n....\n\n\nproxies\n\n   \n proxy\n \nabsfname=\n/tmp/vo_proxy\n \n....\n\n   \n:\n\n\n/proxies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an example mapfile, by default found in \n/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile\n.

By default, the VO Frontend will run as user \nfrontend\n (UID is machine dependent) so these proxies must be owned by the user \nfrontend\n.\n\n\nManual proxy renewal\n\n\nVO Frontend proxy\n\nThe VO Frontend Proxy is used for communicating with the other glideinWMS services (Factory, User Collector and Schedd/Submit services). Create the proxy using the glidenWMS VO Frontend Host (or Service) cert and change ownership to the frontend user.\n\n\nroot@host #\n voms-proxy-init-valid \nhours_valid\n \n\\\n\n-cert /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem \n\\\n\n-key /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem \n\\\n\n-out \n/tmp/vofe_proxy\n\n\nroot@host #\n chown frontend \n/tmp/vofe_proxy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPilot proxy\n\nThe pilot proxy is used on the glideinWMS pilot jobs submitted to the CEs.

This sequence of commands will need to be renewed when the proxy expires or the machine reboots (if /tmp is used only).\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that this location is specified correctly in the \nfrontend.xml\n described in the \nConfiguring the Frontend\n section.\n\n\nYou may want to automate the procedure above (or part of it) by writing a script and adding it to crontab.\n\n\nExample of automatic proxy renewal\n\n\nThis example (user provided) uses the script \nmake-proxy.sh\n attached to this document.

Then start the frontend. The fronten will be fixed in future versions to handle this automatically.\n\n\nCertificates not there\n\n\nThe scripts should send an email warning if there are problems and they fail to generate the proxies.

This software is the minimum requirement for a VO to use glideinWMS.  This document assumes expertise with Condor and familiarity with the glideinWMS software. It  does not  cover anything but the simplest possible install. Please consult the  Glidein WMS reference documentation  for advanced topics, including non- root , non-RPM-based installation.  This document covers three components of the GlideinWMS a VO needs to install:   User Pool Collectors : A set of  condor_collector  processes. Pilots submitted by the factory will join to one of these collectors to form a Condor pool.  User Pool Schedd : A  condor_schedd . Users may submit Condor vanilla universe jobs to this schedd; it will run jobs in the Condor pool formed by the  User Pool Collectors .  Glidein Frontend : The frontend will periodically query the  User Pool Schedd  to determine the desired number of running job slots. If necessary, it will request the factory to launch additional pilots.   This guide covers installation of all three components on the same host: it is designed for small to medium VOs (see the Hardware Requirements below). Given a significant, large host, we have been able to scale the single-host install to 20,000 running jobs.",

            "text": "Install a CVMFS Stratum 1\n\n\nThis document describes how to install a CVMFS Stratum 1. There are many different variations on how to do that, but this document focuses on the configuration of the OSG GOC Stratum 1 oasis-replica.opensciencegrid.org. It is applicable to other Stratum 1s as well, very likely with modifications (some of which are suggested in the document below).\n\n\n\n\nApplicable versions\n\n\nThe applicable software versions for this document are cvmfs and cvmfs-server \n= 2.4.2.\n\n\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points:\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs and Group IDs:\n If your machine is also going to be a repository server like the OSG GOC, the installation will create the same user and group IDs as the \ncvmfs client\n.  If you are installing frontier-squid, the installation will also create the same user id as \nfrontier-squid\n.\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n This installation will host the stratum 1 on ports 80 and 8000 and, if squid is installed, it will host the uncached apache on port 8080.\n\n\nHost choice:\n -  Make sure there is adequate disk space for the repositories that will be served, at \n/srv/cvmfs\n. Do not use xfs as the filesystem type on operating systems older than EL7, because it has been demonstrated to perform poorly for CVMFS repositories; instead use ext3 or ext4. About 10GB should be reserved for apache and squid logs under /var/log on a production server, although they normally will not get that large. A Stratum 1 that is also a repository server should have at least 5GB available at \n/var/cache\n.\n\n\nSELinux\n - Ensure SELinux is disabled\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\n\n\nInstalling\n\n\nAll CVMFS Stratum 1s require cvmfs-server software and apache (httpd). It is highly recommended to also install \nfrontier-squid\n and \nfrontier-awstats\n on the same machine to be able to easily join the WLCG \nMRTG\n and \nawstats\n monitoring systems. The recommended configuration for frontier-squid below only caches geo api lookups.  Other than that, it is primarily for monitoring.\n\n\nInstalling cvmfs-server and httpd\n\n\nThe OSG GOC Stratum 1 has to function as a repository server in addition to serving repository replications; most Stratum 1s serve only replications. Instructions are also provided for how to install cvmfs-server on Stratum 1s that do not have to be repository servers.  Choose the appropriate subsection.\n\n\nInstalling a CVMFS stratum 1 that is also a repository server\n\n\nEL6 does not support a CVMFS repository server with the standard kernel, so use EL7.  EL7.2 cannot be reliably used as a repository server, because of bugs in the union filesystem OverlayFS. The bugs are fixed in EL7.3, so use EL7.3 or later.\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum -y install cvmfs-server cvmfs mod_wsgi\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling CVMFS stratum 1 that is not a repository server\n\n\nIf you're not installing for the OSG GOC or otherwise want to support serving repositories on the same machine as a Stratum 1, use this command on either EL6 or EL7:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum -y install cvmfs-server cvmfs-config mod_wsgi\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling frontier-squid and frontier-awstats\n\n\nfrontier-awstats\n is not distributed by OSG so these instructions get it from its original source.  Do these commands to install frontier-squid and frontier-awstats:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -i http://frontier.cern.ch/dist/rpms/RPMS/noarch/frontier-release-1.1-1.noarch.rpm\n\nroot@host #\n yum -y install frontier-awstats\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring\n\n\nConfiguring the system\n\n\nIncrease the default number of open file descriptors:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n -e \n*\\t\\t-\\tnofile\\t\\t16384\n \n/etc/security/limits.conf \n\nroot@host #\n \nulimit\n -n \n16384\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order for this to apply also interactively when logging in over ssh, the option \nUsePAM\n has to be set to \nyes\n in \n/etc/ssh/sshd_config\n.\n\n\nConfiguring cron\n\n\nFirst, create the log directory: \n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /var/log/cvmfs\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the following in \n/etc/cron.d/cvmfs\n:\n\n\n0,15,30,45 * * * * root test -d /srv/cvmfs || exit;cvmfs_server snapshot -ai \n6 1 * * * root cvmfs_server gc -af 2\n/dev/null || true\n0 9 * * * root find /srv/cvmfs/*.*/data/txn -name \n*.*\n -mtime +2 2\n/dev/null|xargs rm -f\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, put the following in \n/etc/logrotate.d/cvmfs\n:\n\n\n/var/log/cvmfs/*.log {\n    weekly\n    missingok\n    notifempty\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring apache\n\n\nIf you are installing frontier-squid, create \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf\n and put the following lines into it:\n\n\nListen 8080 KeepAlive On\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not installing frontier-squid, instead put the following lines into that file:\n\n\nListen 8000 KeepAlive On\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you will be serving opensciencegrid.org repositories, you have to allow for old client configurations that access repositories without the domain name added. For that reason, you will need to remove each \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.\nrepositoryname\n.conf\n that adding a replica creates (this is included in the \nadd_osg_repository script\n), and instead add the following to \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf\n:\n\n\nRewriteEngine On \nRewriteRule ^/cvmfs/([^./]*)/(.*)$ /cvmfs/$1.opensciencegrid.org/$2 \nRewriteRule ^/cvmfs/([^/]+)/api/(.*)$ /cvmfs/$1/api/$2 [PT] \nRewriteRule ^/cvmfs/(.*)$ /srv/cvmfs/$1 \n\nDirectory\n \n/srv/cvmfs\n \n  Options -MultiViews +FollowSymLinks -Indexes \n  AllowOverride All \n  Require all granted\n\n  EnableMMAP Off EnableSendFile Off\n\n  \nFilesMatch\n \n^\\.cvmfs\n\n    ForceType application/x-cvmfs\n  \n/FilesMatch\n\n\n  Header unset Last-Modified \n  FileETag None\n\n  ExpiresActive On \n  ExpiresDefault \naccess plus 3 days\n \n  ExpiresByType text/html \naccess plus 15 minutes\n \n  ExpiresByType application/x-cvmfs \naccess plus 61 seconds\n \n  ExpiresByType application/json \naccess plus 61 seconds\n \n\n/Directory\n\n\nWSGIDaemonProcess cvmfs-api processes=2 display-name=%{GROUP} \\\n    python-path=/usr/share/cvmfs-server/webapi\nWSGIProcessGroup cvmfs-api \nWSGISocketPrefix /var/run/wsgi \nWSGIScriptAliasMatch /cvmfs/([^/]+)/api /var/www/wsgi-scripts/cvmfs-api.wsgi/$1 \n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL6-based systems (apache httpd 2.2) replace the \"Require all granted\" with \"Order allow, deny\" and \"Allow from all\".\n\n\nIf you will be serving cern.ch repositories, it has the same problem; replace opensciencegrid.org above with cern.ch. If you need to serve both opensciencegrid.org and cern.ch contact Dave Dykstra to discuss the options.\n\n\nThen enable apache.

On EL6 do:\n\n\nroot@host #\n chkconfig frontier-squid on\n\nroot@host #\n service frontier-squid start\n\n\n\n\n\nor on EL7 do:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl \nenable\n frontier-squid\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start frontier-squid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe above configuration is for a single squid thread, which is fine for 1Gbit/s and possibly 2Gbit/s, but if higher bandwidth is needed, see the \ninstructions for running multiple squid workers\n.\n\n\n\n\nVerifying\n\n\nIn order to verify that everything is installed correctly, create a repository replica. The repository chosen for the instructions below is one from egi.eu because it is very small, but you can use another one if you prefer.\n\n\nAdding an example repository\n\n\nThe OSG GOC Stratum 1 should add a repository replica using the \nadd_osg_repository\n script from the oasis-goc rpm. Instructions for installing that are elsewhere. That script assumes that the oasis.opensciencegrid.org replica repository was first created, so this instruction creates it but does not download the first snapshot because that would take a lot of space and time. Use these commands to create the oasis replica and to create and download the example replica:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server add-replica -o root http://oasis.opensciencegrid.org:8000/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org /etc/cvmfs/keys/opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid.org.pub \n\nroot@host #\n add_osg_repository http://cvmfs-stratum0.gridpp.rl.ac.uk:8000/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a good idea for other Stratum 1s to make their own scripts for adding repository replicas, because there's always two or three commands to run, and it's easy to forget the commands after the first one. The first command is this:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server add-replica -o root http://cvmfs-stratum0.gridpp.rl.ac.uk:8000/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu /etc/cvmfs/keys/egi.eu/egi.eu.pub\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, non-GOC OSG Stratum 1s (that is, at BNL and FNAL), for the sake of fulfilling an OSG security requirement, need to instead read from the OSG GOC machine with this as their first command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server add-replica -o root http://oasis-replica.opensciencegrid.org:8000/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu /etc/cvmfs/keys/egi.eu/egi.eu.pub:/etc/cvmfs/keys/opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid.org.pub\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second command for Stratum 1s that have the httpd configuration as described above in the \nConfiguring apache section\n is this:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rm -f /etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.config-egi.egi.eu.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the next command is this:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server snapshot config-egi.egi.eu\n\n\n\n\n\nWith large repositories that can take a very long time, but with small repositories it should be very quick and not show any errors.\n\n\nVerifying that the replica is being served\n\n\nNow to verify that the replication is working, do the following commands:\n\n\nroot@host #\n wget -qdO- http://localhost:8000/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu/.cvmfspublished \n|\n cat -v\n\nroot@host #\n wget -qdO- http://localhost:80/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu/.cvmfspublished \n|\n cat -v\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth commands should show a short file including gibberish at the end which is the signature.\n\n\nIt is a good idea to familiarize yourself with the log entries at \n/var/log/httpd/access_log\n and also, if you have installed frontier-squid, at \n/var/log/squid/access.log\n. Also, at least 15 minutes after the snapshot is finished, check the log \n/var/log/cvmfs/snapshots.log\n to see that it tried to get an update and got no errors.\n\n\nSetting up monitoring\n\n\nIf you installed frontier-squid and frontier-awstats, there is a little more to do to configure monitoring.\n\n\nFirst, make sure that your firewall accepts UDP queries from the monitoring server at CERN. Details are in \nthe frontier-squid instructions\n. Next, choose any random password and put it in \n/etc/awstats/password-file\n. Then tell Dave Dykstra the fully qualified domain name of your machine and the password you chose, and he'll set up the monitoring servers.",

It describes the usage of tools provided by the \nVirtual Data Toolkit\n to evaluate the network performance between resources.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe Network Performance Toolkit is a collection of applications provided by the \nperfSONAR project\n and distributed by the \nOpen Science Grid\n. The \nserver\n components of the Network Performance Toolkit have been installed on dedicated resources of the \nOpen Science Grid\n. Following \nclient\n tools are described in this document:\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Diagnostic Tool (NDT)\n\n\nOne Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)\n\n\nBandwidth Control tool (BWCTL)\n\n\nNetwork Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD)\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nClient Site Installation\n\n\nThe Network Performance Toolkit is installed with the OSG Client. Specifically, the tools included are: BWCTL, NDT and OWAMP (bwctl-client, bwctl-server, bwctl, ndt, owamp-client). NPAD is currently not in OSG client.\n\n\nIf you just want to install the OSG command line clients you can do the following::\n\n\nyum install bwctl-client\n\n\nyum install owamp-client\n\n\nyum install ndt-client\n\n\nyum install npad-client\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may install these utilities separately as RPM using yum by following the \nperfSONAR\n instructions. The packages are in the OSG repository, some of them with a separate client or server version, available for the OSG supported platforms:\n\n\n\n\nNDT: ndt\n\n\nOWAMP: owamp, owamp-client, owamp-server\n\n\nBWCTL: bwctl, bwctl-client, bwctl-server\n\n\nNPAD: npad\n\n\n\n\nServer Site Installation\n\n\nThe \nperfSONAR\n-based tools and services support the following tasks for OSG VO's:\n\n\n\n\nmonitor site-to-site network paths and ensure that these paths remain operational\n\n\ntroubleshoot performance problems quickly and efficiently\n\n\n\n\nThe \nserver site components\n can be brought-up \non demand\n using the netinstall provided by \nperfSONAR project downloads\n. Source packages are provided on the \nperfSONAR home page\n.\n\n\nOnce the Toolkit server has booted you may begin on-demand testing. The server tools will use a generic set of configuration files. The intent is to make it easy to stand up a temporary server when and where it is needed. However, it is expected that a permanently installed server will be customized/configured, allowing it to support both on-demand testing and regularly scheduled monitoring. See the \nperfSONAR home page\n for step-by-step instructions on how to complete this customization process.\n\n\nFinding Target Servers\n\n\nFinding servers against which to run on-demand tests can be a major impediment to effectively using these tools. The \nperfSONAR\n project tackles this problem by running a registration service for participating tools. The Performance Node ISO automatically uses this Lookup Service to advertise the tools' existence. You can also create custom views by making web-service calls to retrieve the data of interest. \n\n\nWe also have requested ALL OSG sites register their perfSONAR Toolkit installations in OIM (See \nhttps://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/RegisterPSinOIM\n ). You can use the MyOSG -\n Resource Group -\n Resource Group Summary page to see a list of perfSONAR Toolkit hosts that are installed at \nhttp://tinyurl.com/mxfmutg\n. Using this list you can select a \"closest\" relevant instance to use for running on-demand tests. Alternately if you have a perfSONAR toolkit install, the web interface has a \"Global Services\" link you can visit to see ALL perfSONAR instances that have updated the perfSONAR lookup service.\n\n\nUsing the Client Tools\n\n\nThese tools support delay measurements (OWAMP), throughput measurements (BWCTL), and advanced diagnostics (NDT and NPAD). The command syntax for each tool is described in the following sub-sections. Each of the client tools listed above communicates with a companion server process to perform a measurement/test.\n\n\nNetwork Diagnostic Tool (NDT)\n\n\nThe Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) runs a series of short tests to determine what the current performance is and what, if anything, is limiting that performance. It can distinguish between host configuration and network infrastructure problems. To diagnose the CE/SE configuration and network connection run the \nweb100clt\n command:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n web100clt \u2013n \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore details can be obtained by using the \n-l\n command line option to \nweb100ctl\n:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n web100clt \u2013n \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n -l\n\n\n\n\n\nTo increase the output further use:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n web100clt \u2013n \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n -ll\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)\n\n\nThe One Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) is an advanced version of the common \nping\n program. The OWAMP client \nowping\n communicates with an OWAMP server and measures the delay in each direction using NTP based time stamps. OWAMP can be used to identify delay, loss, and packet reordering problems inside the network. To measure the delay between the CE/SE and the remote server use the \nowping\n command:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n owping \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBandwidth Control tool (BWCTL)\n\n\nThe Bandwidth Control tool (BWCTL) is a wrapper for the \niperf\n command, its policy and a daemon. BWCTL improves the usability of \niperf\n by avoiding following problems:\n\n\n\n\nneed for remote access to the target host used for measurement\n\n\nsecurity concerns about leaving an \niperf\n daemon running on the target host\n\n\n\n\nBWCTL supports testing in either direction, or between 2 remote BWCTL servers from a third location. To measure the current throughput from your SE/CE to the remote server use the \nbwctl\n command:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n bwctl \u2013s \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird party tests, between 2 remote BWCTL servers, will let you measure various sections of the end-2-end path, running\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n bwctl \u2013c \n1st Server \nfor\n Measurement\n \u2013s \n2nd Server \nfor\n Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther useful options are \n-f\n, format, \n-t\n, length of test, and \n-i\n, test interval.\n\n\nNetwork Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD)\n\n\nNOTE: Network Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD) is deprecated and won't be in future versions of the OSG distribution\n\n\nThe Network Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD) tool examines a host and its local network infrastructure to determine what problems, if any, would hinder wide area performance. Issues such as small TCP buffers in switches and routers are detected as well as common host configuration errors. To determine if the CE/SE will achieve maximum performance over a WAN path run the command \ndiag-client\n:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n diag-client \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n \n8001\n \n10\n \n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe last 2 numeric parameters, after host and port, are the rtt time (in ms) and speed/rate values (in Mbps) you need to achieve. The reason it works this way is that its meant to 'test' local infrastructure. The idea is that if you were testing to an NPAD server that was 5ms away on a 1G network, you would get close to that speed even with network flaws. If you were to supply 80ms and 1G to the server and there truly was a flaw, the NPAD test would tell you it wasn't possible, thus enabling you to fix the problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \ndiag-client\n commands return a partial URL, enabling easy sharing of results between users and site administrators. To view the results, prepend the Toolkit servers name/port to the returned string. The example above would result in this URL: \nhttp://server.this.osg.domain:8002/ServerData/Reports-2011-07/vtbv-ce.uchicago.edu:2011-07-12-18:50:07.html\n.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Topic: Scheduled Monitoring\n\n\n(See \nhttp://docs.perfsonar.net/install_quick_start.html\n for more details.)\n\n\nIn addition to the above on-demand tests, the Performance Toolkit server can be configured to continuously monitor the throughput or delay between your site and peer sites of interest. To begin this monitoring, enter the GUI and ensure that your server is a member of the community or communities of interest. Once that is complete, continue on by selecting either the \nperfSONAR-BUOY\n throughput or delay configuration menu item.\n\n\npSB-throughput: This utility will run regularly scheduled BWCTL tests between your Toolkit server and the selected peer servers. Results are stored in a database and displayed on the server's web page. You may also use standard web-service calls to retrieve this data for display on remote web servers. This would allow monitoring of a common core infrastructure at a central site, while each site could keep local/customized views.\n\n\npSB-delay: This utility will run regularly scheduled OWAMP tests between your Toolkit server and the selected peers. Results are stored in a database and displayed on the server\u2019s web page. You may also use standard web-service calls to retrieve this data for display on remote web servers. This would allow monitoring of a common core infrastructure at a central site, while each site could keep local/customized views as required.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nOne Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)\n\n\nBandwidth Control tool (BWCTL)\n\n\nOSG/WLCG pages on perfSONAR\n.",

To measure the current throughput from your SE/CE to the remote server use the  bwctl  command:  [user@client /opt/npt]$  bwctl \u2013s  Target Server  for  Measurement   Third party tests, between 2 remote BWCTL servers, will let you measure various sections of the end-2-end path, running  [user@client /opt/npt]$  bwctl \u2013c  1st Server  for  Measurement  \u2013s  2nd Server  for  Measurement   Other useful options are  -f , format,  -t , length of test, and  -i , test interval.",

Issues such as small TCP buffers in switches and routers are detected as well as common host configuration errors. To determine if the CE/SE will achieve maximum performance over a WAN path run the command  diag-client :  [user@client /opt/npt]$  diag-client  Target Server  for  Measurement   8001   10   50    Note  The last 2 numeric parameters, after host and port, are the rtt time (in ms) and speed/rate values (in Mbps) you need to achieve. The reason it works this way is that its meant to 'test' local infrastructure. The idea is that if you were testing to an NPAD server that was 5ms away on a 1G network, you would get close to that speed even with network flaws. If you were to supply 80ms and 1G to the server and there truly was a flaw, the NPAD test would tell you it wasn't possible, thus enabling you to fix the problem    Note  The  diag-client  commands return a partial URL, enabling easy sharing of results between users and site administrators. To view the results, prepend the Toolkit servers name/port to the returned string. The example above would result in this URL:  http://server.this.osg.domain:8002/ServerData/Reports-2011-07/vtbv-ce.uchicago.edu:2011-07-12-18:50:07.html .",

            "text": "OSG Release Series\n\n\nAn OSG release series is a sequence of OSG software releases that are intended to provide a painless upgrade path. For example, the 3.2 release series contains OSG software 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and so forth. A release series corresponds to a set of Yum software repositories, including ones for development, testing, and production use. The Yum repositories for one release series are completely distinct from the repositories for a different release series, even though they share many common packages.  A particular release within a series is a snapshot of packages and their exact versions at one point in time. When you install software from a release series, say 3.2, you get the most current versions of software packages within that series, regardless of the current release version.\n\n\nWhen a new series is released, it is an opportunity for the OSG Technology area to add major new software packages, make substantial updates to existing packages, and remove obsolete packages. When a new series is initially released, most packages are identical to the previous release, but two adjacent series will diverge over time.\n\n\nOur goal is, within a series, that one may upgrade their OSG services via \nyum update\n cleanly and without any necessary config file changes or excessive downtime.\n\n\nOSG Release Series\n\n\nSince the start of the RPM-based OSG software stack, we have offered the following release series:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.1\n started in April 2012, and was end-of-lifed in April 2015. While the files have not been removed, it is strongly recommended that it not be installed anymore. Historically, there were 3.0.x releases as well, but there was no separate release series for 3.0 and 3.1; we simply went from 3.0.10 to 3.1.0 in the same repositories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.2\n started in November 2013, and was end-of-lifed in August 2016. While the files have not been removed, it is strongly recommended that it not be installed anymore. The main differences between it and 3.1 were the introduction of glideinWMS 3.2, HTCondor 8.0, and Hadoop/HDFS 2.0; also the gLite CE Monitor system was dropped in favor of osg-info-services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.3\n started in August 2015 and is still supported today.  End-of-support is scheduled for May 2018; sites are encouraged to investigate the upgrade to OSG 3.4. The main differences between 3.3 and 3.2 are the dropping of EL5 support, the addition of EL7 support, and the dropping of Globus GRAM support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4\n stared June 2017. The main differences between it and 3.3 are the removal of edg-mkgridmap, GUMS, BeStMan, and VOMS Admin Server packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG Upcoming\n\n\nThere is one more OSG Series called \"upcoming\" which contains major updates planned for a future release series. The yum repositories for upcoming (\nosg-upcoming\n and \nosg-upcoming-testing\n) are available from all OSG 3.x series, and individual packages can be installed from Upcoming without needing to update entirely to a new series. Note, however, that packages in the \"upcoming\" repositories are tested against the most recent OSG series.  As of the time of writing, \nosg-upcoming\n is meant to work with OSG 3.4.\n\n\nInstalling an OSG Release Series\n\n\nSee the \nyum repositories document\n for instructions on installing the OSG repositories.\n\n\nUpdating from OSG 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 to 3.3 or 3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have an existing installation based on OSG 3.1, 3.2, or 3.3 (which will be referred to as the \nold series\n), and want to upgrade to 3.3 or 3.4 (the \nnew series\n), we recommend the following procedure:\n\n\nFirst, remove the old series yum repositories:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -e osg-release\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step ensures that any local modifications to \n*.repo\n files will not prevent installing the new series repos. Any modified \n*.repo\n files should appear under \n/etc/yum.repos.d/\n with the \n*.rpmsave\n extension. After installing the new OSG repositories (the next step) you may want to apply any changes made in the \n*.rpmsave\n files to the new \n*.repo\n files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the OSG repositories:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -Uvh \nURL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nURL\n is one of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeries\n\n\nEL5 URL (for RHEL5, CentOS5, or SL5)\n\n\nEL6 URL (for RHEL6, CentOS6, or SL6)\n\n\nEL7 URL (for RHEL7, CentOS7, or SL7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.1\n (unsupported)\n\n\nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.1/osg-3.1-el5-release-latest.rpm\n\n\nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.1/osg-3.1-el6-release-latest.rpm\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.2\n (unsupported)\n\n\nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el5-release-latest.rpm\n\n\nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el6-release-latest.rpm\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.3\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.3/osg-3.3-el6-release-latest.rpm\n\n\nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.3/osg-3.3-el7-release-latest.rpm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.4/osg-3.4-el6-release-latest.rpm\n\n\nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.4/osg-3.4-el7-release-latest.rpm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will update \nall\n packages on your system.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n If you are not having the expected result or having problems with Yum please see the \nYum troubleshooting guide\n\n\nMigrating from edg-mkgridmap to LCMAPS VOMS Plugin\n\n\nAfter following the update instructions above, perform the migration process documented \nhere\n.\n\n\nUpdating from Frontier Squid 2.7 to Frontier Squid 3.5 (upgrading from OSG 3.3)\n\n\nThe program \nfrontier-squid\n received a major version upgrade (versions 2.7 to 3.5) between OSG 3.3 and OSG 3.4. Follow the \nupstream upgrade documentation\n when transitioning your squid server to OSG 3.4.\n\n\nUninstalling BeStMan2 from the Storage Element (upgrading to OSG 3.4)\n\n\nThe program BeStMan2 is no longer available in OSG 3.4 and its functionality has been replaced by \nload-balanced GridFTP\n. To update your storage element to OSG 3.4, you must perform the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that OSG BeStMan packages are installed:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -q osg-se-bestman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop the \nbestman2\n service:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service bestman2 stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUninstall the software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum erase bestman2-tester-libs bestman2-common-libs \n\\\n\n                            bestman2-server-libs bestman2-server-dep-libs \n\\\n\n                            bestman2-client-libs bestman2-tester bestman2-client \n\\\n\n                            bestman2-server osg-se-bestman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn the output from this command, yum should \nnot\n list other packages than those nine.

For example, the 3.2 release series contains OSG software 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and so forth. A release series corresponds to a set of Yum software repositories, including ones for development, testing, and production use. The Yum repositories for one release series are completely distinct from the repositories for a different release series, even though they share many common packages.  A particular release within a series is a snapshot of packages and their exact versions at one point in time. When you install software from a release series, say 3.2, you get the most current versions of software packages within that series, regardless of the current release version.  When a new series is released, it is an opportunity for the OSG Technology area to add major new software packages, make substantial updates to existing packages, and remove obsolete packages. When a new series is initially released, most packages are identical to the previous release, but two adjacent series will diverge over time.  Our goal is, within a series, that one may upgrade their OSG services via  yum update  cleanly and without any necessary config file changes or excessive downtime.",

Historically, there were 3.0.x releases as well, but there was no separate release series for 3.0 and 3.1; we simply went from 3.0.10 to 3.1.0 in the same repositories.    OSG 3.2  started in November 2013, and was end-of-lifed in August 2016. While the files have not been removed, it is strongly recommended that it not be installed anymore. The main differences between it and 3.1 were the introduction of glideinWMS 3.2, HTCondor 8.0, and Hadoop/HDFS 2.0; also the gLite CE Monitor system was dropped in favor of osg-info-services.    OSG 3.3  started in August 2015 and is still supported today.  End-of-support is scheduled for May 2018; sites are encouraged to investigate the upgrade to OSG 3.4. The main differences between 3.3 and 3.2 are the dropping of EL5 support, the addition of EL7 support, and the dropping of Globus GRAM support.    OSG 3.4  stared June 2017.

OSG uses RPMs (the Red Hat Packaging Manager) to package its software. While RPM is the packaging format, \nyum\n is the command you will use to do the installation. For example, \nyum\n will resolve and download the dependencies for the package you want to install; \nrpm\n will simply complain if you want to install a package that does not have all its dependencies installed.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nInstallation is done with the \nyum install\n command. Each of the individual installation guide shows you the correct command to use to do an installation. Here is an example installation with all of the output from yum.\n\n\nroot@host #\n sudo yum install osg-ca-certs\n\nLoaded plugins: kernel-module, priorities\n\n\nepel                                                                                         | 3.7 kB     00:00     \n\n\nepel/primary_db                                                                              | 3.8 MB     00:00     \n\n\nfermi-base                                                                                   | 2.1 kB     00:00     \n\n\nfermi-base/primary_db                                                                        |  48 kB     00:00     \n\n\nfermi-security                                                                               | 1.9 kB     00:00     \n\n\nfermi-security/primary_db                                                                    | 1.7 MB     00:00     \n\n\nosg                                                                                          | 1.9 kB     00:00     \n\n\nosg/primary_db                                                                               |  65 kB     00:00     \n\n\nsl-base                                                                                      | 2.1 kB     00:00     \n\n\nsl-base/primary_db                                                                           | 2.0 MB     00:00     \n\n\n957 packages excluded due to repository priority protections\n\n\nSetting up Install Process\n\n\nResolving Dependencies\n\n\n--\n Running transaction check\n\n\n---\n Package osg-ca-certs.noarch 0:1.23-1 set to be updated\n\n\n--\n Finished Dependency Resolution\n\n\nBeginning Kernel Module Plugin\n\n\nFinished Kernel Module Plugin\n\n\n\nDependencies Resolved\n\n\n\n====================================================================================================================\n\n\n Package                         Arch                      Version                     Repository              Size\n\n\n====================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstalling:\n\n\n osg-ca-certs                    noarch                    1.23-1                      osg                    450 k\n\n\n\nTransaction Summary\n\n\n====================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstall       1 Package(s)\n\n\nUpgrade       0 Package(s)\n\n\n\nTotal download size: 450 k\n\n\nIs this ok [y/N]: y\n\n\nDownloading Packages:\n\n\nosg-ca-certs-1.23-1.noarch.rpm                                                               | 450 kB     00:00     \n\n\nwarning: rpmts_HdrFromFdno: Header V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 824b8603\n\n\nosg/gpgkey                                                                                   | 1.7 kB     00:00     \n\n\nImporting GPG key 0x824B8603 \nOSG Software Team (RPM Signing Key for Koji Packages) \nvdt-support@opensciencegrid.org\n from /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-OSG\n\n\nIs this ok [y/N]: y\n\n\nRunning rpm_check_debug\n\n\nRunning Transaction Test\n\n\nFinished Transaction Test\n\n\nTransaction Test Succeeded\n\n\nRunning Transaction\n\n\n  Installing     : osg-ca-certs                                                                                 1/1 \n\n\n\nInstalled:\n\n\n  osg-ca-certs.noarch 0:1.23-1                                                                                      \n\n\n\nComplete!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease Note\n: When you first install a package from the OSG repository, you will be prompted to import the GPG key. We use this key to sign our RPMs as a security measure. You should double-check the key id (above it is 824B8603) with the \ninformation on our signed RPMs\n. If it doesn't match, there is a problem somewhere and you should report it to the OSG via help@opensciencegrid.org.\n\n\nVerifying Packages and Installations\n\n\nYou can check if an RPM has been modified. For instance, to check to see if any files have been modified in the \nosg-ca-certs\n RPM you just installed:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm --verify osg-ca-certs\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lack of any output means there were no problems. If you would like to see all the files for which there are no problems, you can do:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm --verify -v osg-ca-certs\n\n........    /etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n\n........    /etc/grid-security/certificates/0119347c.0\n\n\n........    /etc/grid-security/certificates/0119347c.namespaces\n\n\n........    /etc/grid-security/certificates/0119347c.signing_policy\n\n\n... etc ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach dot indicates a specific check that was made and passed. If someone had modified a file, you might see this:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm --verify osg-ca-certs\n\n..5....T    /etc/grid-security/certificates/ffc3d59b.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means the files MD5 checksum has changed (so the contents have changed) and the timestamp is different. The complete set of changes you might see (copied from the \nrpm\n man page) are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\nfile Size differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\nMode differs (includes permissions and file type)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nMD5 sum differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\nDevice major/minor number mismatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\nreadLink(2) path mismatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU\n\n\nUser ownership differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\nGroup ownership differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nmTime differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't care about some of those changes, you can tell rpm to ignore them. For instance, to ignore changes in the modification time:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm --verify --nomtime osg-ca-certs\n\n..5.....    /etc/grid-security/certificates/ffc3d59b.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding a package\n\n\nIf you want to know what package a file belongs to, you can ask rpm. For instance, if you're curious what package contains the \nsrm-ls\n command, you can do:\n\n\n#\n \n1\n. Find the exact path\n\nuser@host $\n which srm-ls\n\n/usr/bin/srm-ls\n\n\n\n#\n \n2\n. Ask rpm what package it is part of:\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -q --file /usr/bin/srm-ls\n\nbestman2-client-2.2.0-14.osg.el5.noarch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know what other things are in a package--perhaps the other available tools or configuration files--you can do that as well:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -ql bestman2-client\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc\n\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc.samples\n\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/srmclient.conf\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-copy\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-copy-status\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-extendfilelifetime\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-ls\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-ls-status\n\n\n... output trimmed ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat else does a package install?\n\n\nSometimes you need to understand what other software is installed by a package. This can be particularly useful for understanding \nmeta-packages\n, which are packages such as the \nosg-wn-client\n (worker node client) that contain nothing by themselves but only depend on other RPMs. To do this, use the \n--requires\n option to rpm. For example, you can see that the worker node client (as of OSG 3.1.8 in early September, 2012) will install \ncurl\n, \nuberftp\n, \nlcg-utils\n, and a dozen or so other packages.\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -q --requires osg-wn-client\n\n/usr/bin/curl  \n\n\n/usr/bin/dccp  \n\n\n/usr/bin/ldapsearch  \n\n\n/usr/bin/uberftp  \n\n\n/usr/bin/wget  \n\n\nbestman2-client  \n\n\nconfig(osg-wn-client) = 3.0.0-16.osg.el5\n\n\ndcache-srmclient  \n\n\ndcap-tunnel-gsi  \n\n\nedg-gridftp-client  \n\n\nfetch-crl  \n\n\nglite-fts-client  \n\n\nglobus-gass-copy-progs  \n\n\ngrid-certificates  \n\n\njava-1.6.0-sun-compat  \n\n\nlcg-utils  \n\n\nlfc-client  \n\n\nlfc-python  \n\n\nmyproxy  \n\n\nosg-system-profiler  \n\n\nosg-version  \n\n\nrpmlib(CompressedFileNames) \n= 3.0.4-1\n\n\nrpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) \n= 4.0-1\n\n\nvo-client\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding RPM Packages\n\n\nIt is normally best to read the OSG documentation to decide which packages to install because it may not be obvious what the correct packages to install are. That said, you can use yum to find out all sort of things. For instance, you can list packages that begin with \"voms\":\n\n\nuser@host $\n yum list \nvoms*\n\n\nLoaded plugins: kernel-module, priorities\n\n\n957 packages excluded due to repository priority protections\n\n\nAvailable Packages\n\n\nvoms.i386                                                    2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms.x86_64                                                  2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-admin-client.x86_64                                     2.0.16-1                                           osg \n\n\nvoms-admin-server.noarch                                     2.6.1-9                                            osg \n\n\nvoms-clients.x86_64                                          2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-compat.i386                                             1.9.19.2-6.osg                                     osg \n\n\nvoms-compat.x86_64                                           1.9.19.2-6.osg                                     osg \n\n\nvoms-devel.i386                                              2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-devel.x86_64                                            2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-doc.x86_64                                              2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-mysql-plugin.x86_64                                     3.1.5.1-1.el5                                      epel\n\n\nvoms-server.x86_64                                           2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvomsjapi.x86_64                                              2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvomsjapi-javadoc.x86_64                                      2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to search for packages that contain VOMS anywhere in the name or description, you can use \nyum search\n:\n\n\nuser@host $\n yum search voms\n\nLoaded plugins: kernel-module, priorities\n\n\n957 packages excluded due to repository priority protections\n\n\n================================================== Matched: voms ===================================================\n\n\nosg-voms.noarch : OSG VOMS\n\n\nperl-VOMS-Lite.noarch : Perl extension for VOMS Attribute certificate creation\n\n\nperl-voms-server.noarch : Perl extension for VOMS Attribute certificate creation\n\n\nphp-voms-admin.noarch : Web based interface to control VOMS parameters written in PHP\n\n\nvoms.i386 : Virtual Organization Membership Service\n\n\nvoms.x86_64 : Virtual Organization Membership Service\n\n\n... etc ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne last example, if you want to know what RPM would give you the \nvoms-proxy-init\n command, you can ask \nyum\n. The \n*\n indicates that you don't know the full pathname of \nvoms-proxy-init\n.\n\n\nuser@host $\n yum whatprovides \n*voms-proxy-init\n\n\nLoaded plugins: kernel-module, priorities\n\n\n957 packages excluded due to repository priority protections\n\n\nvoms-clients-2.0.6-3.osg.x86_64 : Virtual Organization Membership Service Clients\n\n\nRepo        : osg\n\n\nMatched from:\n\n\nFilename    : /usr/bin/voms-proxy-init\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving Packages\n\n\nTo remove a single RPM, you can use \nyum remove\n. Not only will it uninstall the RPM you requested, but it will uninstall anything that depends on it. For example, if I previously installed the \nvoms-clients\n package, I also installed another package it depends on called \nvoms\n. If I remove \nvoms\n, yum will also remove \nvoms-clients\n:\n\n\nuser@host $\n sudo yum remove voms\n\nLoaded plugins: kernel-module, priorities\n\n\nSetting up Remove Process\n\n\nResolving Dependencies\n\n\n--\n Running transaction check\n\n\n---\n Package voms.x86_64 0:2.0.6-3.osg set to be erased\n\n\n--\n Processing Dependency: libvomsapi.so.1()(64bit) for package: voms-clients\n\n\n--\n Processing Dependency: voms = 2.0.6-3.osg for package: voms-clients\n\n\n--\n Running transaction check\n\n\n---\n Package voms-clients.x86_64 0:2.0.6-3.osg set to be erased\n\n\n--\n Finished Dependency Resolution\n\n\nBeginning Kernel Module Plugin\n\n\nFinished Kernel Module Plugin\n\n\n\nDependencies Resolved\n\n\n\n====================================================================================================================\n\n\n Package                      Arch                   Version                        Repository                 Size\n\n\n====================================================================================================================\n\n\nRemoving:\n\n\n voms                         x86_64                 2.0.6-3.osg                    installed                 407 k\n\n\nRemoving for dependencies:\n\n\n voms-clients                 x86_64                 2.0.6-3.osg                    installed                 373 k\n\n\n\nTransaction Summary\n\n\n====================================================================================================================\n\n\nRemove        2 Package(s)\n\n\nReinstall     0 Package(s)\n\n\nDowngrade     0 Package(s)\n\n\n\nIs this ok [y/N]: y\n\n\nDownloading Packages:\n\n\nRunning rpm_check_debug\n\n\nRunning Transaction Test\n\n\nFinished Transaction Test\n\n\nTransaction Test Succeeded\n\n\nRunning Transaction\n\n\n  Erasing        : voms                                                                                         1/2 \n\n\n  Erasing        : voms-clients                                                                                 2/2 \n\n\n\nRemoved:\n\n\n  voms.x86_64 0:2.0.6-3.osg                                                                                         \n\n\n\nDependency Removed:\n\n\n  voms-clients.x86_64 0:2.0.6-3.osg                                                                                 \n\n\n\nComplete!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading Packages\n\n\nYou can check for updates with \nyum check-update\n.

repository and \nno other\n repositories, you can tell yum to do that with the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum --disablerepo\n=\n* --enablerepo\n=\nosg update\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced topic: Getting debugging information for installed software\n\n\nIf you run into a problem with our software and have a hankering to debug it directly (or perhaps we need to ask you for some help), you can install so-called \"debuginfo\" packages. These packages will provide debugging symbols and source code so that you can do things like run \ngdb\n or \npstack\n to get information about a program.\n\n\nInstalling the debuginfo package requires three steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the installation of debuginfo packages. This only needs to be done once. Edit the yum repo file, usually \n/etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo\n to enable the separate debuginfo repository. Near the bottom of the file, you'll see the \nosg-debug\n repo: \n\n\n[osg-debug]\n\n\n\nname\n=\nOSG Software for Enterprise Linux 5 - $basearch - Debug\n\n\nbaseurl\n=\nhttp://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg-release/$basearch/debu\n\n\nfailovermethod\n=\npriority \n\n\npriority\n=\n98 \n\n\nenabled\n=\n1\n\n\ngpgcheck\n=\n1 \n\n\ngpgkey\n=\nfile:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-OSG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that \"enabled\" is set to 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure out which package installed the program you want to debug. One way to figure it out is to ask RPM. For example, if you want to debug grid-proxy-init:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -qf \n`\nwhich grid-proxy-init\n`\n\n\nglobus-proxy-utils-5.0-5.osg.x86_64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the debugging information for that package. Continuing this example: \n\n\nroot@host #\n debuginfo-install globus-proxy-utils\n\n...\n\n\n=================================================================================================================================\n\n\n Package                                      Arch                   Version                     Repository                 Size\n\n\n=================================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstalling:\n\n\n globus-proxy-utils-debuginfo                 x86_64                 5.0-5.osg                   osg-debug                  61 k\n\n\n\nTransaction Summary\n\n\n=================================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstall       1 Package(s)\n\n\nUpgrade       0 Package(s)\n\n\n\nTotal download size: 61 k\n\n\nIs this ok [y/N]: y\n\n\n...\n\n\nInstalled:\n\n\n  globus-proxy-utils-debuginfo.x86_64 0:5.0-5.osg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last step will select the right package name, then use \nyum\n to install it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nYum not finding packages\n\n\nIf you is not finding some packages, e.g.:\n\n\nError Downloading Packages:\n  packageXYZ: failure: packageXYZ.rpm from osg: [Errno 256] No more mirrors to try.\n\n\n\n\n\nthen you can try cleaning up Yum's cache: \n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerpeo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\nto make an even more thorough job you can follow also add:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean expire-cache --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nyum clean\n cleans only enabled repositories. If you want to also clean any (temporarily) disabled repositories you need to use \n--enablerepo=\u2019*\u2019\n option.\n\n\n\n\nYum complaining about missing keys\n\n\nIf yum is complaining you can re-import the keys in your distribution: \n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY*\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nThe main yum web site\n\n\nA good description of the commands for RPM and yum can be found at \nLearn Linux 101: RPM and YUM Package Management\n.",

If you would like to see all the files for which there are no problems, you can do:  user@host $  rpm --verify -v osg-ca-certs ........    /etc/grid-security/certificates  ........    /etc/grid-security/certificates/0119347c.0  ........    /etc/grid-security/certificates/0119347c.namespaces  ........    /etc/grid-security/certificates/0119347c.signing_policy  ... etc ...

If someone had modified a file, you might see this:  user@host $  rpm --verify osg-ca-certs ..5....T    /etc/grid-security/certificates/ffc3d59b.0   This means the files MD5 checksum has changed (so the contents have changed) and the timestamp is different. The complete set of changes you might see (copied from the  rpm  man page) are:     Letter  Meaning      S  file Size differs    M  Mode differs (includes permissions and file type)    5  MD5 sum differs    D  Device major/minor number mismatch    L  readLink(2) path mismatch    U  User ownership differs    G  Group ownership differs    T  mTime differs     If you don't care about some of those changes, you can tell rpm to ignore them.

These packages will provide debugging symbols and source code so that you can do things like run  gdb  or  pstack  to get information about a program.  Installing the debuginfo package requires three steps.    Enable the installation of debuginfo packages. This only needs to be done once. Edit the yum repo file, usually  /etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo  to enable the separate debuginfo repository. Near the bottom of the file, you'll see the  osg-debug  repo:   [osg-debug]  name = OSG Software for Enterprise Linux 5 - $basearch - Debug  baseurl = http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg-release/$basearch/debu  failovermethod = priority   priority = 98   enabled = 1  gpgcheck = 1   gpgkey = file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-OSG   Make sure that \"enabled\" is set to 1.    Figure out which package installed the program you want to debug. One way to figure it out is to ask RPM.

This is software that is does not go through the same software testing and release processes as the official OSG Software release, but may be useful to you.\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\nYou should be aware:\n\n\n\n\nThe software in the contrib repository may have been more lightly tested than software in our official release. In particular, we do not test all of the software in the contrib repository together, and there is no guarantee all the software in compatible or even that it works.\n\n\nIf you have problems with the software in the contrib repository, you can ask us for help, but you may be on your own. This software is not officially supported and we may not have time to help you with it.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want more software in the repository?\n\n\nWe're happy to work with you to add more software to the contrib repository. If you provide the RPM packaging (preferably a spec file, so we can build it), it will get into the repository than if we have to do the packaging ourselves.\n\n\nWhat software is in the contrib repository?\n\n\nThe definitive list of software in the contrib repository is the repository itself. You can browse:\n\n\n\n\nThe OSG 3.4 EL6 contrib software repository\n\n\nThe OSG 3.4 EL7 contrib software repository\n\n\n\n\nThe software includes:\n\n\n\n\ngsh:\n Gsh is the \"grid shell\". It acts like a simple shell, something like bash, but with fewer features. All of the commands are run with globus-job-run against a remote Compute Element. This can be a very convenient way to debug a Compute Element.\n\n\nglideinwms\n: The \nosg-contrib\n repository contains the development series for the GlideinWMS workload management system. This system submits condor-based pilots to grid sites to create a dynamic worker node pool for user jobs. Contained in the RPMs are packages for frontend and factory installations. This repository contains the development series that has newer features still in wider testing.

            "text": "Installing, Configuring, Using, and Troubleshooting RSV\n\n\nAbout This Guide\n\n\nThe Resource and Service Validation (RSV) software helps a site administrator verify that certain site resources and services are working as expected. OSG recommends that sites install and run RSV, but it is optional; further, each site selects which specific tests (called \nprobes\n) to run.\n\n\nUse this page to learn more about RSV in general, and how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot RSV from the OSG software repositories. For documentation on specific probes or on how to write your own probes, please check the \nReference section\n.\n\n\nIntroduction to RSV\n\n\nThe Resource and Service Validation (RSV) software provides OSG site administrators a scalable and easy-to-maintain resource and service monitoring infrastructure. The components of RSV are:\n\n\n\n\nRSV Client.\n The client tools allow a site administrator to run tests against their site by providing a set of tests (which can run on the same or other hosts within a site), HTCondor-Cron for scheduling, and tools for collecting and storing the results (using Gratia). The client package is not installed by default and may be installed on a CE or other host. Generally, you configure the RSV client to run tests at scheduled time intervals and then it makes results available on a local website. Also, the client can upload test results to a central collector (see next item).\n\n\nRSV Collector/Server.\n The central OSG RSV Collector accepts and stores results from RSV clients throughout OSG, which can be viewed in \nMyOSG\n, on the \u201cCurrent RSV Status\u201d page and under the \u201cResource Group\u201d menu.\n\n\nPeriodic Availability Reports.\n The availability of all active registered OSG resources and the services running on each of those resources is calculated using the results received for critical metrics. Once a day, these availability numbers are \npublished online\n.\n\n\nMyOSG and OIM Links.\n RSV picks up resource information, WLCG interoperability information, etc., from a MyOSG resource group summary listing, which is in turn based on the \nOSG Information Management (OIM) (topology) system\n (Requires registration). Resource \nmaintenance scheduled on OIM\n are forwarded to WLCG SAM, if applicable.\n\n\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user IDs \nrsv\n and \ncndrcron\n\n\nService certificate:\n The RSV service requires a service certificate (\n/etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvcert.pem\n) and matching key (\n/etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvkey.pem\n)\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n To view results, port 80 must accept incoming requests; outbound connectivity to tested services must work, too\n\n\nHost choice:\n Install RSV on your site CE unless you have specific reasons (e.g., performance) for installing on a separate host\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the RSV host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling RSV\n\n\nAn installation of RSV at a site consists of the RSV client software, the Apache web server, parts of HTCondor (for its cron-like scheduling capabilities), and various other small tools. To simplify installation, OSG provides a convenience RPM that installs all required software with a single command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider updating your local cache of Yum repository data and your existing RPM packages:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n\\*\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \nupdate\n command will update \nall\n packages on your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have installed HTCondor already but not by RPM, install a special empty RPM to make RSV happy:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install empty-condor --enablerepo\n=\nosg-empty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall RSV and related software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install rsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring RSV\n\n\nAfter installation, there are some one-time configuration steps to tell RSV how to operate at your site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and follow the instructions in the file. There are detailed comments for each setting. In the simplest case \u2014 to monitor only your CE \u2014 set the \nhtcondor_ce_hosts\n variable to the fully qualified hostname of your CE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have installed HTCondor already but not by RPM, specify the location of the Condor installation in \n30-rsv.ini\n in the \ncondor_location\n setting. If an HTCondor RPM is installed, you do not need to set \ncondor_location\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete the configuration using the \nosg-configure\n tool:\n\n\nroot@host #\n osg-configure -v\n\nroot@host #\n osg-configure -c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional configuration\n\n\nThe following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be required for setting up a small or typical site. If you do not need any of the following special configurations, skip to \nthe section on using RSV\n.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, read the \nConfigureRsv\n page for more advanced configuration options.\n\n\nConfiguring RSV to run probes using a remote server\n\n\nRSV monitors systems by running probes, which can run on the RSV host itself (the default case), via a separate batch system like HTCondor, or via a remote batch system using a Globus gatekeeper and its job manager. The last two options both can count those jobs and report them to, for example, Gratia.\n\n\nIn this case, remember to:\n\n\n\n\nAdd the RSV user \nrsv\n on all the systems where the probes may run, and\n\n\nMap the RSV service certificate to the user you intend to use for RSV. This should be a local user used exclusively for RSV and not belonging to an institutional VO to avoid for the RSV probes to be accounted as regular VO jobs in Gratia. This can be done in \nGUMS\n or \nusing a grid-mapfile-local\n (if you use a grid-mapfile). \nMapServiceCertToRsvUser\n explains how to configure GUMS or the grid-mapfile. Also see the \nCE installation document\n for more information.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the RSV web server to use HTTPS instead of HTTP\n\n\nIf you would like your local RSV web server to use HTTPS instead of the default HTTP (for compatibility or security reasons), complete the steps below. This procedure assumes that you already have an HTTP service certificate (or a copy of the host certificate) in \n/etc/grid-security/http/\n. If not, omit the \nSSLCertificate*\n modifications below, and your web server will start with its own, self-signed certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nmod_ssl\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install mod_ssl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake an alternate set of HTTP service certificate files:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cp -p /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert2.pem\n\nroot@host #\n cp -p /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey2.pem\n\nroot@host #\n chown apache:apache /etc/grid-security/http/http*2.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack up existing Apache configuration files:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cp -p /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.orig\n\nroot@host #\n cp -p /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf.orig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the default port for HTTP connections to 8000 by editing \n/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf\n\n\nListen 8000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up HTTPS access by editing \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf\n:\n\n\nListen 8443\n\nVirtualHost _default_:8443\n\nSSLCertificateFile /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert2.pem\nSSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey2.pem\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter these changes, when you start the Apache service, it will listening on ports \n8000\n (for HTTP) and \n8443\n (for HTTPS), rather than the default port \n80\n (for HTTP only).\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nif you make the changes above, you must restart the Apache server after each CA certificate update to pick up the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing RSV\n\n\nManaging RSV and associated services\n\n\nIn addition to the RSV service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation. The specific services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch CRL\n\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n and \nfetch-crl-cron\n\n\nSee \nCA documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApache\n\n\nhttpd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-Cron\n\n\ncondor-cron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSV\n\n\nrsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the services in the order listed and stop them in reverse order. As a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as \nroot\n):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \u2026\n\n\nRun the command \u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a service\n\n\nservice \nSERVICE-NAME\n start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop a service\n\n\nservice \nSERVICE-NAME\n stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable a service to start during boot\n\n\nchkconfig \nSERVICE-NAME\n on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable a service from starting during boot\n\n\nchkconfig \nSERVICE-NAME\n off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning RSV manually\n\n\nNormally, the HTCondor-Cron scheduler runs RSV periodically. However, you can run RSV probes manually at any time:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rsv-control --run --all-enabled\n\n\n\n\n\nIf successful, results will be available from your local RSV web server (e.g., \nhttp://localhost/rsv\n) and, if enabled (which is the default) on \nMyOSG\n.\n\n\nYou can also run the metrics individually or pass special parameters as explained in the \nrsv-control document\n.\n\n\nTroubleshooting RSV\n\n\nTo get assistance, use the \nhelp procedure\n.\n\n\nRSV has a tool to collect information useful for troubleshooting into a tarball that can be shared with the developers and support staff.\nTo use it:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --profile\n\nRunning the rsv-profiler...\n\n\nOSG-RSV Profiler\n\n\nAnalyzing...\n\n\nMaking tarball (rsv-profiler.tar.gz)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find more information on troubleshooting RSV in the \nrsv-control documentation\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are getting assistance via the trouble ticket system, you must add a \n.txt\n extension to the tarball so it can be uploaded:\n\n\n\n\nResending failed Gratia records\n\n\nIf RSV fails to send Gratia records, it will save a copy of the output into \n/var/spool/rsv/failed-gratia-scripts\n.\nYou will be notified if files are in this directory on your HTML status page.\n\n\nIf files appear here, you can attempt to determine why by looking at this log file: \n/var/log/rsv/consumers/gratia-consumer.output\n.\n(This file is rotated, so the error message may no longer be present.)\n\n\nUsually this error is spurious - there may have been a problem with the central collector being unavailable, or there may have been a network problem.\nThe first step to fix this problem is to try to resend these files.\nTo do so, move them back into the \ngratia\n directory and they will be resent the next time the gratia-script-consumer runs (about every 5 minutes):\n\n\nroot@host#\n mv /var/spool/rsv/failed-gratia-records/* /var/spool/rsv/gratia-consumer/\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant file locations\n\n\nLogs and configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric log files\n\n\n/var/log/rsv/metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer log files\n\n\n/var/log/rsv/consumers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML files\n\n\n/usr/share/rsv/www/\n\n\nAvailable at \nhttp://your.host.example.com/rsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial configuration\n\n\n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n\n\nRead by \nosg-configure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSV configuration\n\n\n/etc/rsv\n\n\nGenerally files in this directory should not be edited directly. Use \nosg-configure\n instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric configuration\n\n\n/etc/rsv/metrics/HOSTNAME/METRICNAME.conf\n\n\nTo change arguments and environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the metrics and the other files in RSV you can use also the RPM commands: \nrpm -ql rsv-metrics\n and \nrpm -ql rsv\n.\n\n\nGetting more information from rsv-control\n\n\nThe first step to getting more information is to run rsv-control with more verbosity. Use the \n--verbose\n (\n-v\n) flag. This flag can be used with any of rsv-control's abilities (run, enable, list, etc). The verbosity levels are:\n\n\n\n\n0 = print nothing\n\n\n1 = print warnings and errors along with usual output of command being run (1 is the default level)\n\n\n2 = adds informational messages\n\n\n3 = full debugging output\n\n\n\n\nFor example, here is the output when running a metric with -v2.\n\n\n\n  \nShow detailed ouput\n\n\n   [root@fermicloud016 condor]# rsv-control -r org.osg.general.osg-version -v 2 -u osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu\n\n\n   INFO: Reading configuration file /etc/rsv/rsv.conf\n\n\n   INFO: Reading configuration file /etc/rsv/consumers.conf\n\n\n   INFO: Validating configuration:\n\n\n   INFO: Validating user:\n\n\nINFO:     Invoked as root.

The client tools allow a site administrator to run tests against their site by providing a set of tests (which can run on the same or other hosts within a site), HTCondor-Cron for scheduling, and tools for collecting and storing the results (using Gratia). The client package is not installed by default and may be installed on a CE or other host. Generally, you configure the RSV client to run tests at scheduled time intervals and then it makes results available on a local website. Also, the client can upload test results to a central collector (see next item).  RSV Collector/Server.  The central OSG RSV Collector accepts and stores results from RSV clients throughout OSG, which can be viewed in  MyOSG , on the \u201cCurrent RSV Status\u201d page and under the \u201cResource Group\u201d menu.

This document provides instructions for configuration beyond what osg-configure is able to do.\n\n\nConfiguring metrics\n\n\nIf you need to change the behavior of a metric you can edit the metric configuration files. These replace the spec files from previous versions of RSV.\n\n\n\n\n/etc/rsv/metrics\n - changes made to conf file in this directory named after a metric will affect the metric when run against all hosts\n\n\n/etc/rsv/metrics/\nHOST\n - changes made to conf files in this directory (named as the host FQDN) will affect the metric when run against the specific host\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration files are in INI format and have two sections:\n\n\n\n\na first one named after the metric with execution options\n\n\na second one with the name including the \"args\" keyword, including parameters sent to the probe at invokation\n\n\n\n\nChanging the times a metric runs\n\n\nTo change the time a metric runs set the \ncron-interval\n setting in the metric's conf file. Use \nman 5 crontab\n for a description of the format. For example, to change the \norg.osg.general.ping-host\n to run at a different time:\n\n\n[org.osg.general.ping-host]\n\n\ncron-interval\n \n=\n \n45 * * * *\n\n\n\n[org.osg.general.ping-host args]\n\n\n#ping-count =\n\n\n#ping-timeout =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBe sure to put the \ncron-interval\n setting in the \n[org.osg.general.ping-host]\n section, and not the \n[org.osg.general.ping-host args]\n section! The purpose of the \"args\" section is described in the \"passing extra parameters to a metric\" section below.\n\n\n\n\nAfter modifying the cron time of a metric you must restart RSV for the change to take effect.\n\n\nTo see what times each of the metrics is running you can use \nrsv-control\n as follows:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control -l --cron-times\n\n\nMetrics enabled for host: osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu:10443 | Cron times\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------+--------------------\n\n\norg.osg.srm.srmcp-readwrite                         | 28 * * * *\n\n\norg.osg.srm.srmping                                 | 13,33,53 * * * *\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing extra parameters to a metric\n\n\nAny \nkey=value\n pairs in the \"args\" section of the metric's \nconf\n file will be turned into command line parameters to the probe. For example, for this file:\n\n\n[org.osg.certificates.cacert-expiry args]\n\n\nwarning-hours\n \n=\n \n6\n\n\nerror-hours\n \n=\n \n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would lead to the probe getting called with the command-line parameters \n--warning-hours 6 --error-hours 12\n.\n\n\nConfigure consumers\n\n\nThere is a configuration file common to all consumers: \n/etc/rsv/consumers.conf\n. It is a file in INI format and possible entries are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nValues\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenabled\n\n\nconsumers\n\n\nComma-separated list of consumers to be enabled\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\n\n\nlocal\n\n\nIf this is set to local, a record with a local timestamp will be supplied to the consumer. If this is set to any other value, or is not set, a record with the GMT will be created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach consumer has a configuration file in \n/etc/rsv/consumers\n named after it. This allows to specify command lines and environment for the consumers. Some consumers may have also their own configuration file, usually in \n/etc/rsv/\n. Below is an example for the Nagios consumer.\n\n\nSending RSV records to Nagios\n\n\n\n\nEdit your \n/etc/rsv/rsv-nagios.conf\n file and fill in the appropriate information. The path of the configuration file is specified in \n/etc/rsv/consumers/nagios-consumer.conf\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf your Nagios config file contains password information you will want to lock down the permissions.

It details the usage of the \nrsv-control\n command for enabling, disabling, testing and running RSV probes.\n\n\nrsv-control\n provides an interface to many RSV tasks. \nrsv-control\n can view RSV jobs, run metrics, enable or disable metrics and consumers, and allow advanced configuration.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nrsv-control\n can be used to configure RSV as described here and in \nthe advanced configuration document\n. Most site admins will be able to configure RSV by editing \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and running \nosg-configure\n as described in the \ninstallation doc\n.\n\n\n\n\nUsing \nrsv-control\n to configure is for advanced RSV use including enabling non-default metrics. Admins who don't use \nrsv-control\n for configuration can still use it to view their RSV jobs, run RSV tests, and help debug RSV problems. Anyone can view the jobs, but you must be root or the RSV user (\nrsv\n by default) to execute other commands, e.g. run, enable and disable probes, or to turn RSV on and off.\n\n\nViewing RSV jobs\n\n\nrsv-control provides two different views: viewing the \ndesired\n state and viewing the current \nactual\n state.\n\n\n\n\nDesired = what metrics and consumers will start the next time RSV is started\n\n\nActual = what metrics and consumers are currently running\n\n\n\n\nDesired state\n\n\nTo view the desired state, use the \n--list\n (\n-l\n for short) flag.

Note that \"enable\" and \"disable\" are desired states (this is similar to \nosg-control\n). After enabling a metric you should turn it on if you want it to be running immediately. After disabling a metric that is running, you should still turn it off (a message will print after each of these actions to remind you of this behavior).\n\n\nEnabling\n\n\nThe syntax for enabling metrics looks similar to the syntax for running metrics:\n\n\nrsv-control --enable --host \nHOST\n \nMETRIC\n [ \nMETRIC2\n ...]\n\n\nYou must provide a host to enable the metric against (in order to enable a metric on multiple hosts you must run \nrsv-control\n once per host).\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --enable \n\\\n\n    --host osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu org.osg.gip.consistency\n\nEnabling metric \norg.osg.gip.consistency\n for host \nosg-edu.cs.wisc.edu\n\n\n\nOne or more metrics have been enabled and will be started the next time RSV is started.

Use the \n--verbose\n (\n-v\n) flag. This flag can be used with any of rsv-control's abilities (run, enable, list, etc). The verbosity levels are:\n\n\n\n\n0 = print nothing\n\n\n1 = print warnings and errors along with usual output of command being run (1 is the default level)\n\n\n2 = adds informational messages\n\n\n3 = full debugging output\n\n\n\n\nUsing the RSV verify tool\n\n\nThe \n--verify\n flag will run some basic checks for your RSV installation:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --verify\n\nTesting if Condor-Cron is running...\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\nTesting if metrics are running...\n\n\nOK (98 running metrics)\n\n\n\nTesting if consumers are running...\n\n\nOK (1 running consumers)\n\n\n\nChecking which consumers are configured...\n\n\nThe following consumers are enabled: html-consumer\n\n\nWARNING: The gratia-consumer is not enabled.

Warning  rsv-control  can be used to configure RSV as described here and in  the advanced configuration document . Most site admins will be able to configure RSV by editing  /etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini  and running  osg-configure  as described in the  installation doc .   Using  rsv-control  to configure is for advanced RSV use including enabling non-default metrics. Admins who don't use  rsv-control  for configuration can still use it to view their RSV jobs, run RSV tests, and help debug RSV problems. Anyone can view the jobs, but you must be root or the RSV user ( rsv  by default) to execute other commands, e.g. run, enable and disable probes, or to turn RSV on and off.",

For a site to pass the test, it must successfully run a simple test job via the normal GlideinWMS mechanisms, in much the same way as a real VO job.\n\n\nUse this page to learn how to install, configure, and use the Tester for your VO front-end.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nSoftware:\n You must have \na GlideinWMS Front-end\n installed\n\n\nConfiguration:\n The GlideinWMS Front-end must be configured (a) \nto have at least one group that matches pilots to sites using DESIRED_SITES\n, and (b) \nto support the is_itb user job attribute\n\n\nHost choice:\n The Tester should be installed on its own host; a small Virtual Machine (VM) is ideal\n\n\nService certificate:\n The Tester requires a host certificate at \n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n and an accompanying key at \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n Test jobs must be able to contact the tester using the HTCondor Shared Port on port 9615 (TCP), and you must be able to contact a web server on port 80 (TCP) to view test results.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the Tester\n\n\nThe Tester software takes advantage of several other OSG software components, so the installation will also include OSG\u2019s site validation system (RSV), HTCondor, and the GlideinWMS pilot submission software.\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install rsv-gwms-tester\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Tester\n\n\nBefore you use the Tester, there are some one-time configuration steps to complete, one set on your GlideinWMS Front-end Central Manager host and one set on the Tester host.\n\n\nConfiguring the GlideinWMS Front-end Central Manager\n\n\nComplete these steps \non your GlideinWMS Front-end Central Manager host\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorize the Tester host to connect to your Central Manager:\n\n\nroot@host #\n glidecondor_addDN -allow-others -daemon \nCOMMENT\n \nTESTER_DN\n condor\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nCOMMENT\n is a human-readable label for the Tester host (e.g., \u201cRSV GWMS Tester at myhost\u201d), and \nTESTER_DN\n is the Distinguished Name (DN) of the host certificate of your Tester host. Most likely, you will need to quote both of these values to protect them from the shell. For example:\n\n\nroot@host #\n glidecondor_addDN -allow-others -daemon \nRSV GWMS Tester on Fermicloud\n \n/DC=com/DC=DigiCert-Grid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=fermicloud357.fnal.gov\n condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart HTCondor to apply the changes\n\n\nOn \nEL\u00a06\n systems:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service condor restart\n\n\n\n\n\nOn \nEL\u00a07\n systems:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl restart condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the new Tester to your GlideinWMS front-end configuration.\n   Edit the file \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n and add a line as follows within the \nschedds\n element\n\n\nschedd DN=\nTESTER_DN\n fullname=\nTESTER_HOSTNAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nTESTER_DN\n is the Distinguished Name (DN) of the host certificate of your Tester host (as above), and \nTESTER_HOSTNAME\n is the fully qualified hostname of the Tester host. For example:\n\n\nschedd DN=\n/DC=com/DC=DigiCert-Grid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=fermicloud357.fnal.gov\n fullname=\nfermicloud357.fnal.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReconfigure your GlideinWMS front-end to apply the changes:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service gwms-frontend reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Tester host\n\n\nComplete the following steps \non your Tester host\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the Tester for the VOs that your Front-end supports\n\n\nEdit the file \n/etc/rsv/metrics/org.osg.local-gfactory-site-querying-local.conf\n. The \nconstraint\n line is an HTCondor ClassAd expression containing one \nstringListMember\n function per VO that your Front-end supports. If there is more than one VO, the function invocations are joined by the \u201clogical or\u201d operator, \n||\n. Edit the \nconstraint\n line for your Front-end.\n\n\nFor example, for a single VO named \nFoo\n, the line would be:\n\n\nconstraint = stringListMember(\nFoo\n, GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor two VOs named \nFoo\n and \nBar\n, the line would be:\n\n\nconstraint = stringListMember(\nFoo\n, GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs) || stringListMember(\nBar\n, GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not change the other settings in this file, unless you have clear and specific reasons to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorize the central manager of your Front-end to connect to the tester host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n glidecondor_addDN -allow-others -daemon \nCOMMENT\n \nCENTRAL_MGR\n condor\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nCOMMENT\n is a human-readable identifier for the Central Manager, and \nCENTRAL_MGR\n is the Distinguished Name (DN) of the host certificate of your GlideinWMS Front-end\u2019s Central Manager host. Most likely, you will need to quote both of these values to protect them from the shell. For example:\n\n\nroot@host #\n glidecondor_addDN -allow-others -daemon \nUCSD central manager DN\n \n/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=osg-ligo-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the special HTCondor-RSV instance with your host IP address.\n\n\nCreate the file \n/etc/condor/config.d/98_public_interface.config\n with this content:\n\n\nNETWORK_INTERFACE = \nADDRESS\n\nCONDOR_HOST = \nCENTRAL_MGR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nADDRESS\n is the IP address of your Tester host, and \nCENTRAL_MGR\n is the hostname of your GlideinWMS Front-end Central Manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the Tester\u2019s RSV probe:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rsv-control --enable org.osg.local-gfactory-site-querying-local --host localhost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Tester\n\n\nThere are at least two aspects of using the Tester:\n\n\n\n\nManaging the services that are associated with the Tester software\n\n\nViewing results from the Tester\n\n\n\n\nManaging Tester services\n\n\nBecause the Tester is built on other OSG software, there are a number of services in your installation. The specific services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApache HTTP Server\n\n\nhttpd\n\n\nWeb server for results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-Cron\n\n\ncondor-cron\n\n\ncron-like jobs in HTCondor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSV\n\n\nrsv\n\n\nOSG site validator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing Tester results\n\n\nOnce the Tester RSV probe is enabled and active, and the services listed above have been started, there are two kinds of RSV probes that run periodically:\n\n\n\n\nOne probe asks the GlideinWMS factory for the up-to-date list of sites supported by your VO(s)\u00a0\u2014 runs every 30 minutes\n\n\nOne probe submits and monitors one test job to each site supported by your VO(s)\u00a0\u2014 run every 60 minutes\n\n\n\n\nYou can view the latest results of both probe types on an RSV results web page, or you can manually run the first probe to see the full list of sites.\n\n\nViewing RSV results online\n\n\nTo see the latest results, access \nhttps://\nHOSTNAME\n/rsv/\n (where \nHOSTNAME\n is the name of your Tester host).\n\n\n\n\nThere should be one result row per site supported by your VO(s), using the \u201corg.osg.general.dummy-vanilla-probe\u201d probe (aka \nmetric\n)\n\n\nThere should be exactly one result row for the probe that fetches the list of sites, which is the \u201corg.osg.local-gfactory-site-querying-local\u201d probe (aka \nmetric\n)\n\n\nThere is a legend for the background colors at the end of the page\n\n\n\n\nIdeally, each site supported by your VO(s) should be shown with a green background, which indicates that a Tester job ran at that site recently and successfully. There may be transient failures but if you notice a site in the failed state over multiple days, contact OSG Factory Operations (\n) about the failing site, including a link to your Tester RSV results page.\n\n\nTo see detailed information from each probe, click on the probe name in the Metric column.\n\n\nTo see the list of sites that are supported by your VO(s) and are being tested, click the \u201corg.osg.local-gfactory-site-querying-local\u201d link at the bottom of the list of probes. You can also run the probe manually, as described next.\n\n\nListing supported sites manually\n\n\nTo manually run the probe that fetches the list of sites supported by your VO(s), run the following command on your Tester host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rsv-control --run org.osg.local-gfactory-site-querying-local --host localhost\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probe produces many lines of output, some of which are just about the probe execution itself. But look for lines like this:\n\n\nMSG: Updating configuration for host \nUCSD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highlighted name is the site name, and there should be one such line per site supported by your VO(s).\n\n\nTroubleshooting RSV-GWMS-Tester\n\n\nYou can find more information on troubleshooting in the \nRSV troubleshooting section\n\n\nLogs and configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondor Cron log files\n\n\n/var/log/condor-cron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric configuration\n\n\n/etc/rsv/metrics/org.osg.local-gfactory-site-querying-local.conf\n\n\nTo change arguments and environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nTo get assistance, please use the \nthis page\n.\n\n\nReference\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\n\nUser that owns certificate\n\n\nPath to certificate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost certificate\n\n\nroot\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost key\n\n\nroot\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind instructions to request a host certificate \nhere\n.",

For GUMS sites, this means that each user that can be authenticated by GUMS should be created on the server.\n\n\nNote that these users must be kept in sync with the authentication method. For instance, if new users or rules are added in GUMS, then new users should also be added here.\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\nTwo certificates are needed for operation of this service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\n\nUser that owns certificate\n\n\nPath to certificate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost certificate\n\n\nroot\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n and \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBestman service certificate\n\n\nbestman\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmancert.pem\n and \n/etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmankey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the \ninstructions\n to request a service certificate.\n\n\nYou will also need a copy of CA certificates. Note that the \nosg-se-bestman\n package will automatically install a certificate package but will not necessarily pick the cert package you expect; see \nthe CA certificates\n documentation for more information.\n\n\nNetworking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService Name\n\n\nProtocol\n\n\nPort Number\n\n\nInbound\n\n\nOutbound\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP data channels\n\n\ntcp\n\n\nGLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\ncontiguous range of ports is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP data channels\n\n\ntcp\n\n\nGLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\ncontiguous range of ports is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP control channel\n\n\ntcp\n\n\n2811\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSRM\n\n\ntcp\n\n\n8443\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering Considerations\n\n\nPlease answer following questions before you proceed with installation and configuration of BeStMan storage element:\n\n\nQ. \nWhat authorization mechanism should I use?\n\n\nDecide between a \ngrid-mapfile\n or a \nGUMS\n server for authorization.  Both mechanisms are deprecated with a planned removal by May 2018.  The replacement mechanism, however, does not work with \nbestman2\n.\n\n\nQ. \nHow many GridFTP servers will I need?\n\n\nChoose to run multiple GridFTP servers for load balancing and better performance. We recommend to install additional GridFTP servers if your Storage Element:\n\n\n\n\nIs serving data to more than 1000 cores for VOs that use storage heavily (e.g. CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0),\n\n\nIs managing more than 500 TB of disk space, OR\n\n\nHas more than 10Gbps bandwidth\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend approximately one GridFTP server for each 8Gbps of desired utilized bandwidth.\n\n\nQ. \nDo I need to change default configuration of Gridftp server?\n\n\nYes, you may want to do this if the node on which GridFTP server will be installed has multiple network interfaces. Read \nthis section\n for more details.\n\n\nQ. \nDo you need to enable Gratia gridftp-transfer probes?\n \n\nThe Gratia gridftp-transfer probes provide OSG storage statistics for accounting purposes. The reports include the source and destination of transfers, certificate subject of transfer initiator, as well as the size and status of the transferred file. The probe needs to be installed on every GridFTP server.\n\n\nInstall Instructions\n\n\nInstalling BeStMan2\n\n\n\n\nInstall Java using \nthese instructions\n.\n\n\nInstall the BeStMan Storage element meta-package:\n\n\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-se-bestman\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization\n\n\nThere are two authorization options:\n\n\n\n\nGridmap file\n\n\nGUMS authentication server\n\n\n\n\nPlease choose one of these and follow the instructions in one of the two following sections.\n\n\nConfiguring Gridmap Support\n\n\nBy default, GridFTP uses a gridmap file, found in \n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n. This file is not generated by default. can generate this file. You can generate this file manually, by including DN/username combinations (this is most useful for debugging). Otherwise, you can use \nedg-mkgridmap\n, which will periodically contact a list of VOMS servers that you specify.\n\n\nOnce \nedg-mkgridmap\n is configured, you will have to modify \n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc\n and change \nGridMapFileName\n from \n/etc/bestman2/conf/grid-mapfile.empty\n to:\n\n\nGridMapFileName=/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2\n, change\n\n\nBESTMAN_GUMS_ENABLED\n=\nno\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring GUMS support\n\n\nBy default, GridFTP uses a gridmap file, found in \n/etc/grid-security/gridmap-file\n. If you want to use GUMS security (recommended), you will need to enable it using the following steps.\n\n\nFirst, edit \n/etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf\n and uncomment the authorization callout:\n\n\nglobus_mapping liblcas_lcmaps_gt4_mapping.so lcmaps_callout\n\n\n\n\n\nNext edit \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n to enter the correct GUMS hostname:\n\n\ngumsclient = \nlcmaps_gums_client.mod\n\n             \n-resourcetype ce\n\n             \n-actiontype execute-now\n\n             \n-capath /etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n             \n-cert   /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n\n             \n-key    /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n             \n--cert-owner root\n\n# Change this URL to your GUMS server\n             \n--endpoint https://\nGUMS_HOSTNAME\n:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to modify the following settings in \n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2\n\n\nBESTMAN_GUMSCERTPATH\n=\n/etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmancert.pem\n\nBESTMAN_GUMSKEYPATH\n=\n/etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmankey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to modify the following settings in \n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc\n\n\nGUMSserviceURL=https://\nGUMS_HOST\n:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit Bestman Settings\n\n\nBestman settings are split into three files:\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment variables (except those that represent server and client libraries) are stored in \n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2\n.\n\n\nThe server and client library environment variables are stored in \n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2lib\n.\n\n\nConfiguration is stored in \n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou should review these settings to make sure all of them comply with your environment. You are not expected to edit \n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2lib\n .\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.3.0-9, you will need to remove \nall\n entries for \nBESTMAN2_SERVER_LIB\n and \nBESTMAN2_CLIENT_LIB\n in file \n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2.\n These settings are now present in file \n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2lib\n\n\n\n\nYou will likely need to modify the following settings in \n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc\n:\n\n\nlocalPathListAllowed=/tmp\nCertFileName=/etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmancert.pem\nKeyFileName=/etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmankey.pem\nsupportedProtocolList=gsiftp://\nGRIDFTP_HOSTNAME\n;gsiftp://\nGRIDFTP_HOSTNAME2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nMake sure the value for \nlocalPathListAllowed\n is correctly entered - i.e. each path separated by a \n;\n. If it is not, this parameter may not be effective.\nMake sure the permissions for the \nlocalPathListAllowed\n directory(ies) are set to 1777, which is the default for \n/tmp\n. Further, note that on many systems, \n/tmp\n gets cleared out automatically, so you may want to use a different location to ensure that the files persist.\n\n\n\n\nBeStMan requires up to two sets of certificate pairs. One is for host services; when clients connect to BeStMan, they will receive this certificate (\nCertFileName\n, \nKeyFileName\n) as proof of the server identity. The second certificate pair (\nBESTMAN_GUMSCERTPATH\n, \nBESTMAN_GUMSKEYPATH\n) is used to communicate with GUMS when verifying identity information (this only applicable for GUMS-enabled sites). These two can (and usually will be) the same files, but can be split if your GUMS setup requires a specific identity.\n\n\nlocalPathListAllowed\n determines which paths users will be able to access via SRM.\n\n\nsupportedProtocolList\n is a semi-colon list of GridFTP servers that the BeStMan will use as transfer agents. If you are using anything but the standard GridFTP port 2811, you will also have to add the port (ie \ngsiftp://\nHOSTNAME\n:port\n).\n\n\nFinally, modify \nGUMSserviceURL\n to use your local GUMS installation if you are using GUMS.\n\n\nModify \n/etc/sudoers\n\n\nBeStman requires the \nsudo\n command in order to write information as the proper user. You will need to give the \nbestman\n user the proper permissions to run these commands.\n\n\nModify \n/etc/sudoers\n and comment the following line.\n\n\n#Defaults    requiretty\n\n\n\n\n\nThen add the following lines at the end of the \n/etc/sudoers\n file.\n\n\nCmnd_Alias SRM_CMD = /bin/rm, /bin/mkdir, /bin/rmdir, /bin/mv, /bin/cp, /bin/ls\nRunas_Alias SRM_USR = ALL, !root\nbestman   ALL=(SRM_USR) NOPASSWD: SRM_CMD\n\n\n\n\n\nCopying certificates to an alternate location\n\n\nBeStMan requires a certificate pair to function; this must be readable by the \nbestman\n user.\n\n\nroot@host #\n cp /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem /etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmankey.pem\n\nroot@host #\n cp /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem /etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmancert.pem\n\nroot@host #\n chown -R bestman:bestman /etc/grid-security/bestman/\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify \nCertFileName\n and \nKeyFileName\n in \n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc\n are set appropriately.\n\n\n(Optional) Using a different bestman user\n\n\nIf you would like to use a different user than the default \nbestman\n user (\nnot recommended\n), you will need to change the following:\n\n\n\n\nOwnership of bestman certs in \n/etc/grid-security/bestman\n.\n\n\nSRM_OWNER\n in \n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2\n to the new user.\n\n\nUser in \n/etc/sudoers\n. The last line (\nbestman ALL(SRM_USR) NOPASSWD: SRM_CMD\n) should be changed from \nbestman\n to the new user.\n\n\nOwnership of \n/var/log/bestman2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nCurrently the RPM packaging will change the ownership of the \n/var/log/bestman2\n directory back to \nbestman\n on upgrades.\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) Modifying default logging for \nevent.srm.log\n\n\nThe logging directory (\n/var/log/bestman2\n) has two types of logs - \nbestman2.log\n and \nevent.srm.log\n.\n\n\nLog-rotation of \nbestman2.log\n file is controlled by \n/etc/logrotate.d/bestman2\n file.\n\n\nBy default, the size of \nevent.srm.log\n log file is set to 50MB within the Bestman code itself.\n\n\nLeft unchanged, \nevent.srm.log\n file counts will keep increasing indefinitely.  Depending on the usage, the number of these files can become high enough to fill up the partition that holds these logs.\n\n\nThere are 3 ways to avoid this -\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify following parameters (commented by default) in the \n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2\n file\n\n\n# Number of files to keep\n\n\nBESTMAN_EVENT_LOG_COUNT\n=\n10\n\n\n# Size of each file in bytes\n\n\nBESTMAN_EVENT_LOG_SIZE\n=\n20971520\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe optimal value for these depends on usage of the service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a directory under a much bigger partition and have a symlink from \n/var/log/bestman2\n to that directory.\n\n\n\n\nLeave the default settings, but have your own custom script that cleans these files according to your needs.\n\n\n\n\nStarting Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfetch-crl\n\n\nFor RHEL 6:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /usr/sbin/fetch-crl   \n# This fetches the CRLs \n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service fetch-crl-boot start\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron start\n\n\n\n\n\nFor RHEL 7:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /usr/sbin/fetch-crl   \n# This fetches the CRLs \n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start fetch-crl-boot\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start fetch-crl-cron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nroot@host #\n service globus-gridftp-server start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBestman\n\n\nroot@host #\n service bestman2 start\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start Bestman automatically at boot time\n\n\nroot@host #\n chkconfig bestman2 on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGratia transfer probe:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service gratia-gridftp-transfer start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStopping Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfetch-crl\n\n\nFor RHEL 6:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /usr/sbin/fetch-crl   \n# This fetches the CRLs\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service fetch-crl-boot stop\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron stop\n\n\n\n\n\nFor RHEL 7:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /usr/sbin/fetch-crl   \n# This fetches the CRLs\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl stop fetch-crl-boot\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl stop fetch-crl-cron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nroot@host #\n service globus-gridftp-server stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBestman\n\n\nroot@host #\n service bestman2 stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGratia transfer probe\n\n\nroot@host #\n service gratia-gridftp-transfer stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidation of Service Operation\n\n\nOnce you have your SE setup and configured, there are several ways to monitor your installation.

Decide between a  grid-mapfile  or a  GUMS  server for authorization.  Both mechanisms are deprecated with a planned removal by May 2018.  The replacement mechanism, however, does not work with  bestman2 .  Q.  How many GridFTP servers will I need?  Choose to run multiple GridFTP servers for load balancing and better performance. We recommend to install additional GridFTP servers if your Storage Element:   Is serving data to more than 1000 cores for VOs that use storage heavily (e.g. CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0),  Is managing more than 500 TB of disk space, OR  Has more than 10Gbps bandwidth   We recommend approximately one GridFTP server for each 8Gbps of desired utilized bandwidth.  Q.  Do I need to change default configuration of Gridftp server?  Yes, you may want to do this if the node on which GridFTP server will be installed has multiple network interfaces. Read  this section  for more details.  Q.  Do you need to enable Gratia gridftp-transfer probes?   \nThe Gratia gridftp-transfer probes provide OSG storage statistics for accounting purposes. The reports include the source and destination of transfers, certificate subject of transfer initiator, as well as the size and status of the transferred file.

BeStMan requires up to two sets of certificate pairs. One is for host services; when clients connect to BeStMan, they will receive this certificate ( CertFileName ,  KeyFileName ) as proof of the server identity. The second certificate pair ( BESTMAN_GUMSCERTPATH ,  BESTMAN_GUMSKEYPATH ) is used to communicate with GUMS when verifying identity information (this only applicable for GUMS-enabled sites). These two can (and usually will be) the same files, but can be split if your GUMS setup requires a specific identity.  localPathListAllowed  determines which paths users will be able to access via SRM.  supportedProtocolList  is a semi-colon list of GridFTP servers that the BeStMan will use as transfer agents. If you are using anything but the standard GridFTP port 2811, you will also have to add the port (ie  gsiftp:// HOSTNAME :port ).

If you have not installed an XRootD server yet, follow the instructions in \nthe xrootd install documentation\n.\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\nGridFTP, which is a part of this meta-package, requires a certificate package to run. If you require a specific certificate package, follow the \nInstallCertAuth\n instructions to install it. If you do not install a grid certificate package first, the install procedure will install one for you as part of its dependencies. (usually osg-ca-certs).\n\n\nPackage installation instructions\n\n\n\n\nInstall Java using \nthese instructions\n\n\nInstall the BeStMan Gateway XRootD Storage element meta-package:\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-se-bestman-xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring GridFTP authentication\n\n\nFor information on how to configure authentication for your GridFTP installation, please refer to the \nconfiguring authentication section of the GridFTP guide\n.\n\n\nConfiguring GridFTP XRootD support\n\n\nIn order to configure GridFTP to work with XRootD, you will need to configure the Data Storage Interface (DSI) module with Xrootd pre-load libraries. This module is used to access Xrootd and POSIX file systems.\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd-dsi\n (create it if it is missing) and set XROOTD_VMP (XRootD Virtual Mount Point) to use your Xrootd redirector.\n\n\nexport XROOTD_VMP=\nredirector:1094:/local_path=/remote_path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe syntax of the above environment variable is a little confusing, so make sure that you adhere to the following directions for XROOTD_VMP (Virtual Mount Point):\n\n\n- Redirector: This is the hostname and domain of the local XRootD redirector server.\n- local_path: This is the path used to access the GridFTP server (ie this server).\n- remote_path: This is the path used to access the XRootD redirector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe xrootd-dsi module overloads the \ngridftp.conf\n file and uses the alternate file \n/etc/xrootd-dsi/gridftp-xrootd.conf\n. If you have made local changes to your \ngridftp.conf\n file, then you will need to carry them over to \n/etc/xrootd-dsi/gridftp-xrootd.conf\n.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring xrootdfs\n\n\nThough the DSI module will work for GridFTP, you will need a FUSE mount in order for BeStMan to work correctly with XRootD. Configure it using the following steps.\n\n\nModify \n/etc/fstab\n by adding the following entries:\n\n\n....\nxrootdfs                \n/mnt/xrootd\n              fuse    rdr=xroot://\nredirector1.domain.com\n:1094/\n/path/\n,uid=xrootd 0 0\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \n/mnt/xrootd\n with the path that you would like to access with BeStMan. This should also match the GridFTP settings for the \nXROOTD_VMP\n local path. Create \n/mnt/xrootd\n directory. Once you are finished, you can mount it:\n\n\nmount /mnt/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to run UNIX commands such as \nls /mnt/xrootd\n to see the contents of the XRootD server.\n\n\n(Optional) Configuring secured xrootdfs\n\n\nIf you want to enable security for access to xrootd via xrootdfs you will need to modify xrootd configuration and perform several steps to make xrootdfs secured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the xrootd redirector node, execute the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n xrdsssadmin -k \nmy_key_name\n -u anybody -g usrgroup add \nkeyfile\n\n\n\neg:\n\n\n\nroot@host #\n xrdsssadmin -k top_secret -u anybody -g usrgroup add /etc/xrootd/xrootd.key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet ownership\n\n\nroot@host #\n chown xrootd.xrootd /etc/xrootd/xrootd.key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the node where xrootdfs is installed modify \n/etc/fstab\n add security information:\n\n\nroot@host #\n xrootdfs \n/mnt/xrootd %ENDCOLOR\n fuse rdr=xroot://\nredirector1.domain.com\n:1094/\n/path/redirector1\n,uid=xrootd,sss=\nkeyfile\n 0 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn all xrootd data servers and redirector node, modify xrootd configuration (\n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n) by adding the following segment: \n\n\n# ENABLE_SECURITY_BEGIN \n   xrootd.seclib /usr/lib64/libXrdSec.so \n   #the line below should be before \nsec.protocol ... unix\n\n   \nsec.protocol /usr/lib64 sss -s keyfile \n\n   sec.protocol /usr/lib64 unix \n   # this specify that we use the \nunix\n authentication module, additional one can be specified. \n   # this is the authorization file\n   acc.authdb /etc/xrootd/auth_file\n   ofs.authorize \n   # ENABLE_SECURITY_END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn all xrootd data server nodes, edit /etc/xrootd/auth_file to add authorized users of the form \nu \nusername\n \n/directoryname\n lr\n where \"lr\" is the permission set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy \nkeyfile\n from redirector node to every data server node and the xrootdfs node. Make sure that this file is owned by the \nxrootd\n user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart xrootd cluster by following \nthese instructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn xroodfs node execute mount:\n\n\nroot@host #\n mount \n/mnt/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that you can access the mount point (df,ls) and can not write into unauthorized path, e.g:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cp /bin/sh /mnt/xrootd/tlevshin/test1 cp: \n\ncannot create regular file \\`/mnt/xrootd/tlevshin/test1\n: Permission denied\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin as yourself and try:\n\n\nroot@host #\n su - tlevshin \n\nuser@host $\n cp /bin/sh /mnt/xrootd/tlevshin/test1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit Bestman Settings\n\n\nSee \nEdit Bestman Settings\n\n\nModify \n/etc/sudoers\n\n\nSee \nBestman Instructions\n\n\n(Optional) Copying certificates to a bestman location\n\n\nSee \nBestman Instructions\n\n\nValidation\n\n\nValidation can be done similar to a stand-alone BeStMan or GridFTP server.

For this to happen, make sure that \nbefore\n you run \nedg-mkgridmap\n, you have created user accounts for all such VOs.\n\n\nThe RPM named \nedg-mkgridmap\n should be installed on your node\n\n\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\n\nOwnership and permissions\n\n\nPath to certificate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost certificate\n\n\nroot\n, \n0644\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost key\n\n\nroot\n, \n0600\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nIf you claim to support a VO, make sure the following is true:\n\n\n\n\nThe VO is enabled in \n/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf\n\n\nThe local user account to which VO members are mapped to exists on the CE\n\n\nAfter you run \nedg-mkgridmap\n, the VO should exist in \n/var/lib/osg/supported-vo-list\n\n\n\n\nLet's begin with configuration:\n\n\nStep 1\n Make sure for all Virtual Organizations (VOs) that you want to support, you have created a local user account. After that, you need to tell \nedg-mkgridmap\n, which Virtual Organizations (VOs) you want to support. For this, edit \n/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf\n such that all VOs that you want to support are uncommented and all VOs that you do not want to support are commented out. Here is an example \nedg-mkgridmap.conf\n in which \ncdf\n VO is disabled and \nfermilab\n VO is enabled:\n\n\n/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf\n:\n\n\n#### GROUP: group URI [lcluser]\n#\n#-------------------\n# USER-VO-MAP cdf CDF -- 1 -- Dennis Box (dbox@fnal.gov)\n#group vomss://voms.fnal.gov:8443/voms/cdf cdf\n#group vomss://voms.cnaf.infn.it:8443/voms/cdf cdf\n#-------------------\n# USER-VO-MAP fermilab FERMILAB -- 2 -- Fermilab Service Desk (servicedesk@fnal.gov)\ngroup vomss://voms.fnal.gov:8443/voms/fermilab fermilab\n[root@server]#\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2\n For any additional DNs that you want to support (i.e. you want them to be present in the final \ngrid-mapfile\n that gets created), you need to add their \nDN\n \nusername\n mapping to a local grid-mapfile, for example \n/etc/osg/local-user-vo-map\n. Here is an example of how each line of this file should look like.\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/local-grid-mapfile\n:\n\n\n/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Neha Sharma/CN=UID:neha\n neha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe local gridmap file is used also to add certificates of service accounts like the one used for RSV testing.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n You need to tell \nedg-mkgridmap\n about this local grid-mapfile. For this, you need to use the \ngmf_local\n directive. And if the entry in the local gridmap introduces a new user you should add it to a VO by adding a line \nusername\n \nvoname\n in the local vo-map file \n. And if you use a new VO you must add a VO naming line in \nedg-mkgridmap.conf\n as well (one starting with \n# USER-VO-MAP ...\n ). Here is an example of how your \nedg-mkgridmap.conf\n would now look like:\n\n\n/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf\n:\n\n\n#### GROUP: group URI [lcluser]\n\n\n#\n\n\n#-------------------\n\n\n# USER-VO-MAP cdf CDF -- 1 -- Dennis Box (dbox@fnal.gov)     \n\n\n#group vomss://voms.fnal.gov:8443/voms/cdf cdf\n\n\n#group vomss://voms.cnaf.infn.it:8443/voms/cdf cdf\n\n\n#-------------------\n\n\n# USER-VO-MAP fermilab FERMILAB -- 2 -- Fermilab Service Desk (servicedesk@fnal.gov)  \n\n\ngroup\n \nvomss:\n//\nvoms\n.\nfnal\n.\ngov:8443\n/\nvoms\n/\nfermilab\n \nfermilab\n\n\n# USER-VO-MAP rsv RSV -- 101 -- Your Name (your@email)\n\n\ngmf_local\n /\netc\n/\ngrid-security\n/\nlocal-grid-mapfile\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n If you have additional \nuseraccount vo\n mappings that you want to be included in final \n/var/lib/osg/user-vo-map\n file, add those mappings to \n/etc/osg/local-user-vo-map\n file.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nMore information on \nedg-mkgridmap.conf\n file can be found \nhere\n\n\n\n\nEnable/Disable\n\n\nEnable\n\n\nYou need to configure \nedg-mkgridmap\n to run automatically via a cron job. To do this, you need to run the following command.\n\n\n[root@server]#\n service edg-mkgridmap start\n\nEnabling periodic edg-mkgridmap:                           [  OK  ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entry in cron file (\n/etc/cron.d/edg-mkgridmap-cron\n) looks like\n\n\n/etc/cron.d/edg-mkgridmap-cron\n:\n\n\n# Cron job running by default every 6 hours.\n# The lock file can be enabled or disabled via a\n# service edg-mkgridmap start\n# chkconfig edg-mkgridmap on\n\n# Note the lock file not existing is success hence the the slightly odd logic\n# below.\n# run every 6 hours but sleep for random time every 5 hours\n\n0 */6 * * * root perl -e \nsleep rand 18000\n; [ ! -f /var/lock/subsys/edg-mkgridmap ] || /usr/sbin/edg-mkgridmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAs you can see above, this cron will run every 6 hours.

Its output is the following files\n\n\n\n\n/var/lib/osg/supported-vo-list\n. This file contains names of all VOs you want to support minus all VOs for whom you do not have a user account. In other words, this is list of VOs that will \nactually\n be supported.\n\n\n/var/lib/osg/user-vo-map\n . This file contains mapping of form 'useraccount VO' for all VOs in \n/var/lib/osg/supported-vo-list\n and also mappings from \n/etc/osg/local-user-vo-map\n file.\n\n\n/var/lib/osg/undefined-accounts\n. This file contains names of all VOs for which it \ncould not\n find user account.\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n. This file contains 'DN username' mappings that are present in local grid-mapfile (if you have one) and mappings for \nall\n users from \nall\n VOs that are present in \n/var/lib/osg/supported-vo-list\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens when you perform an upgrade?\n\n\nThere are two scenerios:\n\n\nYou do not have a custom edg-mkgridmap configuration\n\n\nThis means you are using the same \nedg-mkgridmap.conf\n file that came with prior installation of vo-client-edgmkgridmap package. In this case, during upgrade, the newer \nedg-mkgridmap.conf\n file will replace the old one. It will probably have new VOs in it and if you want to support them, you need to satisfy conditions as mentioned in Configuration section above.\n\n\nYou have a custom edg-mkgridmap configuration\n\n\nThis means you have modified the \nedg-mkgridmap.conf\n file. In this case, during upgrade, the existing file \n/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf\n will remain untouched and new configuration file will be saved as \n/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf.rpmnew\n. You can compare the two files and make changes as required.\n\n\nFiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Location\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf\n\n\nMain Edg-mkgridmap configuration file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/cron.d/edg-mkgridmap-cron\n\n\nEdg-mkgridmap cron file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/rc.d/init.d/edg-mkgridmap\n\n\nEdg-mkgridmap init file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/log/edg-mkgridmap.log\n\n\nEdg-mkgridmap log file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nCommon Problems\n\n\n\n\ngrid-mapfile not created\n\n\nError code 64\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting Procedure\n\n\nIn case of problems first of all check the service log file \n/var/log/edg-mkgridmap.log\n.

The \nLCMAPS VOMS Plugin\n is the preferred method for site authentication in the OSG and is available in both OSG 3.3 and OSG 3.4.\n\n\n\n\nGUMS Install Guide\n\n\nThis document is intended for site administrators who want to install and configure the GUMS service.\n\n\nGUMS is a service that authorizes and maps users from their global (X.509) identity to a local (Linux user) identity. It is not a required service (some sites use the simple \nedg-mkgridmap\n to construct a \ngrid-mapfile\n instead), but it is commonly used. GUMS is useful when more than one resource (Compute Element, Storage Element, etc.) needs to authorize or map users, because it helps them share data. It is particularly helpful when using gLExec at a site, because gLExec runs on every worker node and needs authorization and mapping information. GUMS is a web application that runs in Tomcat.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux users \nmysql\n (UID 27) and \ntomcat\n (UID 91)\n\n\nService certificate:\n The GUMS service uses a host certificate at \n/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem\n and an accompanying key at \n/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n Hosts using your GUMS server for authentication (e.g., HTCondor-CE, GridFTP) must be able to contact it on port 8443 (TCP)\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling GUMS\n\n\n\n\nWhether installing or upgrading GUMS, please make sure to follow \nthese instructions\n for updating/installing Java to work correctly with GUMS\n\n\nIf you have an existing GUMS installation on the same host, shut down Tomcat.\n    The service is named \ntomcat6\n on EL6 and \ntomcat\n on EL7\n\n\n\n\nInstall the GUMS Service:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n yum install osg-gums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Tomcat to use GSI:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n /var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/configure.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis step will overwrite your \nserver.xml\n file in your tomcat configuration directory (\n/etc/tomcat6\n on EL6, \n/etc/tomcat\n on EL7).\nIf you are using Tomcat on this host for non-grid purposes, you may want to save the \nserver.xml\n file first, run the script, then merge your own configuration back into the file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring GUMS\n\n\nConfigure GUMS database\n\n\nIn this section, you will configure the GUMS MySQL database, either by creating a new database or by copying an existing GUMS database. Pick the appropriate subsection below for your environment.\n\n\nNew Installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the database server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL6, this is MySQL:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n service mysqld start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, this is MariaDB:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n systemctl start mariadb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new GUMS database:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n /usr/bin/gums-setup-mysql-database \n\\\n\n    --user gums --host localhost:3306 --password \npassword\n \n\\\n\n    --template /etc/gums/gums.config.template\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe password is saved in plaintext in the \n/etc/gums/gums.config\n file, so choose one that is not used elsewhere. The \ngums.config\n file should be readable only by the \ntomcat\n user, but this situation provides light security at best\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen specifying the database host with the \n--host\n option above, it is also possible to use \n$HOSTNAME\n instead of \nlocalhost\n, though \nlocalhost\n is recommended. This value corresponds to \n@SERVER@\n in a \ngums.config.template\n file, discussed below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAlthough it is possible to specify a different location for the \n--template\n or to omit the option and use the default GUMS template (at \n/usr/lib/gums/config/gums.config.template\n), neither option is typically useful for an OSG installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd yourself as a GUMS administrator:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n gums-add-mysql-admin \nYOUR DN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Optional but recommended:] Apply reasonable MySQL security settings:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade from existing GUMS server on another host\n\n\nNote for GUMS 1.4+:\n Since the database schema has not changed between GUMS 1.3 and 1.4, the database name continues to be \nGUMS_1_3\n. \nDo not\n rename \nGUMS_1_3\n database references to \nGUMS_1_4\n. There was a schema change within the GUMS 1.4 series, but this happens automatically when GUMS is started - make sure the GUMS user has permission to perform schema changes. Nevertheless the database name remains \nGUMS_1_3\n in GUMS 1.4 and GUMS 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the older host, dump the GUMS_1_3 database to a text file:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n mysqldump GUMS_1_3 \n gums_1_3.sql\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the \ngums_1_3.sql\n file from the old host to the new one\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart MySQL:\n\n\nFor EL 6:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n service mysqld start\n\n\n\n\n\nFor EL 7:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n systemctl start mariadb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad the old GUMS data into the new MySQL database:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n \necho\n \nCREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS GUMS_1_3;\n \n|\n mysql\n\n[root@server]#\n mysql GUMS_1_3 \n gums_1_3.sql\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Optional but recommended for new MySQL instances:] Apply reasonable MySQL security settings:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet Initial GUMS Configuration\n\n\nIn this section, you will set up an initial GUMS configuration file, either by copying in an OSG template or by copying an existing configuration from an old installation. Pick the appropriate subsection below for your environment.\n\n\nNew Installation\n\n\nIf you ran the \ngums-setup-mysql-database\n command above with the \n--template\n option, the OSG GUMS template will be used. This should have created a suitable \n/etc/gums/gums.config\n with the configuration values in this section already filled in. \nIn that case, you can skip this section.\n\n\nIf you ran the \ngums-setup-mysql-database\n command above \nwithout\n a \n--template\n option, it created a default, pre-configured \n/etc/gums/gums.config\n file. It is almost certainly not what you want. Instead, it is recommended that you start with an OSG template for your configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the OSG template over the default configuration file:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n cp /etc/gums/gums.config.template /etc/gums/gums.config\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the new \n/etc/gums/gums.config\n file and change the following settings (note: each placeholder occurs exactly once in the file):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch for\n\n\nReplace with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@USER@\n\n\nThe name of the MySQL GUMS user. If you followed the instructions above, this will be \ngums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@PASSWORD@\n\n\nThe password for the MYSQL GUMS user (see above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@SERVER@\n\n\nThe name of your computer and port (e.g. \nlocalhost\n or \nmy.computer:3306\n). See note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@DOMAINNAME@\n\n\nYour local domain (e.g. \nwisc.edu\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNormally MySQL is running on the same machine as GUMS (as in the instructions above).\n\nWe \nhighly recommend\n using \nlocalhost\n instead of the actual hostname; this will cause MySQL to use a local Unix socket instead of listening on the network, which is more secure.\nIf you use \nlocalhost\n, there is no need to specify a port.\nIn either case, the value for \n@SERVER@\n \nmust\n match the value for \n--host\n used when setting up the GUMS database with the \ngums-setup-mysql-database\n command\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Log Rotation\n\n\nBy default, certain output is written to files named \n/var/log/tomcat*/catalina.YYYY-MM-DD.log\n without automatic cleanup of old logs. To configure log rotation and cleanup of \ncatalina.log\n, follow the steps below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the Tomcat directory name based on your operating system:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your operating system is...\n\n\nThen your TOMCAT DIR NAME is...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEL6\n\n\ntomcat6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEL7\n\n\ntomcat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/tomcat*/logging.properties\n so that Tomcat only produces a single, undated log file:\n\n\n--- /etc/\nTOMCAT DIR NAME\n/logging.properties.orig\n\n\n+++ /etc/\nTOMCAT DIR NAME\n/logging.properties\n\n\n@@ -24,7 +24,8 @@\n\n catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler.level = FINE\n catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler.directory = ${catalina.base}/logs\n\n-catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler.prefix = catalina.\n\n\n+catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler.prefix = catalina\n\n\n+catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler.rotatable = false\n\n\n localhost.org.apache.juli.FileHandler.level = FINE\n localhost.org.apache.juli.FileHandler.directory = ${catalina.base}/logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite \n/etc/logrotate.d/tomcat_catalina_logs\n to configure \nlogrotate\n:\n\n\n/var/log/\nTOMCAT DIR NAME\n/catalina.log\n{ copytruncate weekly rotate 52 compress missingok create 0644 tomcat tomcat }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\n\nThe GUMS service is actually a web application running within the Tomcat web application server.

You must have the certificate that you used for \ngums-add-mysql-admin\n above loaded in your browser. You should see the GUMS web page load.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nJavascript must be enabled in order to make any configuration changes on the web interface.\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not see it load, check a few things:\n\n\nFor EL 6:\n\n\n\n\nLook for errors in \n/var/log/tomcat6/catalina.out\n and \n/var/log/tomcat6/catalina.err\n.\n\n\nLook for errors in \n/var/log/tomcat6/trustmanager.log\n. There are likely to be CRL errors in this file, this can be ignored unless all your CA's get CRL errors in which case you should check to make sure that your CRL updates are running correctly.\n\n\n\n\nFor EL 7:\n\n\n\n\nLook for errors in \n/var/log/tomcat/catalina.*.log\n\n\nLook for errors in \n/var/log/tomcat/trustmanager.log\n. There are likely to be CRL errors in this file, this can be ignored unless all your CA's get CRL errors in which case you should check to make sure that your CRL updates are running correctly.\n\n\n\n\nFor all systems:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that you have an http certificate in \n/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem\n and \n/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem\n. Make sure it is readable by the \ntomcat\n user. Permissions should be as follows:\n\n\n\n\n[root@server]#\n ls -l /etc/grid-security/http/\n\ntotal 8\n\n\n-r--r--r-- 1 tomcat tomcat 1671 Jul 2 15:54 httpcert.pem\n\n\n-r-------- 1 tomcat tomcat 1675 Jul 2 15:54 httpkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you change the permissions/ownership, make sure to restart tomcat so that your changes take effect.\n\n\nCheck accounts\n\n\nAfter you connect to the GUMS web page, go to the Summary tab to check the configuration. You should see several dozen OSG VOs listed.\n\n\nIn the Account column on the summary page, you will see the local Unix user accounts that these VO users will be mapped to. It is critical that these accounts exist on the gatekeeper and worker nodes at your site. If they do not, there will be errors when users attempt to access your site.\n\n\nUpdate VO members list\n\n\nGUMS contacts each VOMS server to update its knowledge of VO membership every 6 hours. After installing or updating GUMS, you should trigger the update manually by going to the Update VO Members tab, and clicking update.\n\n\nYou can track the progress of the update process by watching a log file.\n\n\nFor EL 6:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n tail -f /var/log/tomcat6/gums-service-admin.log\n\n\n\n\n\nFor EL 7:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n tail -f /var/log/tomcat/gums-service-admin.log\n\n\n\n\n\nWith so many VOMS servers in the OSG config, several member updates may fail for various reasons (e.g., host down \"connect timed out\", bad or expired host certificates, etc.). Unfortunately, this situation is normal. Typically, you will see about 5 or 6 failed updates, with the rest succeeding. The update will take a while and then should display any errors that occurred during the updates. To get more details or track the update process in real time, look at \n/var/log/gums-service-admin.log\n.\n\n\nMap a known good user DN\n\n\n\n\nGo to Map Grid Identity to Account tab: \nhttps://\nHOSTNAME\n:8443/gums/map_grid_identity_form.jsp\n\n\nFill in the required info. Service DN means the DN of the host certificate of your CE (see above). Use the DN of a user (probably yourself) who you know belongs to a particular VO. Fill in the VO name in the VOMS FQAN field.\n\n\nClick \"map user\". A failed mapping will display \"null\". A successful mapping will display a UNIX account name.\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous Procedures\n\n\nForcing GUMS to update the set of users\n\n\nGUMS automatically contacts each VOMS server every 6 hours to update its knowledge of VO membership. To trigger a manual update:\n\n\n\n\nAccess the \u201cUpdate VO Members\u201d tab\n\n\nClick \"Update\"\n\n\n\n\n[Optional:] Monitor update progress via a log file:\n\n\nFor EL 6:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n tail -f /var/log/tomcat6/gums-service-admin.log\n\n\n\n\n\nFor EL 7:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n tail -f /var/log/tomcat/gums-service-admin.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith so many VOMS servers in the OSG config, several member updates may fail for various reasons (e.g., host down \"connect timed out\", bad or expired host certificates, etc.). Unfortunately, this situation is normal.\n\n\nUpdating the GUMS configuration\n\n\nPeriodically, the OSG Grid Operations Center will release an updated template for the GUMS configuration that updates information about an existing VO or adds a new VO. You may get the update as part of a regular update process, or you can force an update by using yum:\n\n\n[root@server]#\n yum update osg-gums-config\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step does \nnot\n update your GUMS configuration (\n/etc/gums/gums.config\n) but will update the template for your configuration (\n/etc/gums/gums.config.template\n), because RPM cannot merge configuration changes. Instead, use GUMS to merge in the new VO configuration information:\n\n\n\n\nGo to the Merge Configuration tab: \nhttps://\nHOSTNAME\n:8443/gums/mergeConfiguration.jsp\n\n\n\n\nCut and paste the URL of the OSG template into the Configuration URI field\n\n\nFor the template provided in the RPM, use: \nfile:///etc/gums/gums.config.template\n\n\nTo fetch it directly from the GOC, use \nhttp://repo.opensciencegrid.org/pacman/tarballs/vo-version/gums.template\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Merge\n\n\nYou should get a green success message if it has worked, along with a suggestion that you update the VO members\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the Summary tab to verify the set of VOs you have, as well as their accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nUseful Configuration and Log Files\n\n\nConfiguration Files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService or Process\n\n\nConfiguration File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMySQL\n\n\n/etc/my.cnf\n\n\nMySQL configuration, e.g. server port\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntomcat (EL6)\n\n\n/etc/tomcat6/\n\n\nTomcat configuration files\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntomcat (EL7)\n\n\n/etc/tomcat/\n\n\nTomcat configuration files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService or Process\n\n\nLog File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntomcat (EL6)\n\n\n/var/log/tomcat6/catalina.out\n\n\nThis is the Tomcat log file.

Support is scheduled to end as of May 2018.\n\n\n\n\nThis document is intended for System Administrators that are installing the OSG version of glexec.\n\n\nGlexec is commonly used for what are referred to as \"pilot\" or \"glidein\" jobs.\n\n\nTraditionally, users submitted their jobs directly to a remote site (or compute element gatekeeper). The user job was authenticated/authorized to run at that site based on the user\u2019s proxy credentials and run under the local unix account assigned.\n\n\nIn a pilot-based infrastructure, users submit their jobs to a centralized site (or queue). The pilot/glidein software at the centralized site then recognizes there is a demand for computing resources. It will then submit what is called a pilot/glidein job to a remote site. This pilot job gets authenticated/authorized to run on a worker node in that site\u2019s cluster. It will then \"pull\" down user jobs from the centralized queue and execute them. Both the pilot and the user job are run under the pilot job\u2019s proxy certificate credentials and local unix account. This represents a security problem in pilot-based systems as there is no authentication/authorization of the individual user\u2019s proxy credentials and, thus, the user\u2019s jobs do not run using it\u2019s own local unix account.\n\n\nGlexec is a security tool that can be used to resolve this problem. It is meant to be used by VOs that run these pilot-based jobs. It has a number of authentication plugins and can be used both by European grid and by OSG.\n\n\nThe pilot job will \"pull\" user jobs down from the central queue and invoke glexec which will then\n\n\n\n\nauthenticate the user job\u2019s proxy,\n\n\nperform an authorization callout (to GUMS in the case of OSG, or possibly a gridmapfile) similar to that done by the gatekeeper,\n\n\nand then run the user job under the local account assigned by the authorization service for that user.\n\n\n\n\nIn effect, glexec functions much the same as a compute element gatekeeper, except these functions are now performed on the individual worker node. The pilot jobs authentication/authorization is done by the gatekeeper and the individual user jobs are now done by glexec on the individual worker node.\n\n\nMany worker node clusters use shared file systems like NFS for much of their software and user home accounts. Since glexec is an suid program, it must be installed on every single worker node individually. Most shared file systems do not handle this correctly so it cannot and must not be NFS-exported.\n\n\nFor more information regarding pilot-based systems and glexec:\n\n\n\n\nglideinWMS - The glidein based WMS\n\n\nAddressing the pilot security problem with gLExec (pdf)\n\n\n\n\nEngineering Considerations\n\n\nIf glexec is to be used at a site, it should be installed and configured on every worker node.\n\n\nA large number of batch slots using glexec can occasionally put an enormous strain on GUMS servers and cause overloading and client timeouts. In order to survive peak loads, the sysctl parameter \nnet.core.somaxconn\n on a GUMS server machine should be set at least as high as the maximum number of job slots that might attempt to contact the server at about the same time.  For example, Fermilab set the value to 4096 on each of two servers and tested with a continuous load from 5000 job slots.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nThese are the requirements that must be met to install glexec.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNormally you will install the \nOSG worker node\n first. Installing the \nosg-wn-client-glexec\n package will also install the worker node, but we do not duplicate instructions specific to the worker node here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify you are using one of the \nsupported platforms\n.\n\n\nPrior to installing \nglexec\n, verify the \nyum repositories\n are correctly configured.\n\n\nroot\n access to the host is required.\n\n\nThe worker nodes will need the \nCA certificates\n used to sign the proxies.\n\n\nfetch-crl\n should be enabled and working.\n\n\n\n\nThe glexec installation will create two users unless they are already created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nglexec\n\n\nReduced privilege separate id used to improve security. If creating the account by hand, set the default gid of the \nglexec\n user to be a group that is also called \nglexec\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngratia\n\n\nNeeded for the glexec gratia probe which is also automatically installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, OSG glexec requires a range of \ngroup ids\n for tracking purposes. You don\u2018t actually have to create the group entries but it is recommended to do so in order to reserve the gids and so they can be associated with names in the \n/usr/bin/id\n command. The recommended names are \nglexecNN\n where NN is a number starting from 00.\n\n\n\n\nDefine at least 4 group ids per batch slot per worker node. A conservative way to handle this is to multiply the number of batch slots on the largest worker node by 6 and then share the group ids between all the worker nodes.\n\n\nThey must be consecutive and in any range (default range is 65000-65049, configured in the \nconfiguring glexec\n section below).\n\n\nThe same group IDs can be used on every worker node.\n\n\n\n\nInstall Instructions\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe glexec tracking function requires a part of HTCondor. There are multiple ways to install HTCondor; if you want a minimal install, you can run just this command to install the needed piece from the OSG distribution:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install condor-procd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter meeting all the requirements in the previous section, install glexec with this command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-wn-client-glexec\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring glexec\n\n\nThe following steps need to be done after the glexec installation is complete.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, review the contents of \n/etc/glexec.conf\n. All of the defaults should be fine, but if you want to change the behavior, the parameters are described in \nman glexec.conf\n.\n\n\n\n\nNext, review all of the contents of \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n and in particular update the following pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have GUMS, change \nGUMS_HOST\n in the following line to the fully qualified domain name of your GUMS server:\n\n\n\u2013endpoint https://\nGUMS_HOST\n:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use a range of tracking group ids other than the default as described in the \nRequirements\n section above, uncomment and change the \n-min-gid\n and \n-max-gid\n lines to your chosen values:\n\n\n-min-gid 65000\n \n-max-gid 65049\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncomment the following two lines:\n\n\nglexectracking = \nlcmaps_glexec_tracking.mod\n\n                 \n-exec /usr/sbin/glexec_monitor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have GUMS, uncomment the following policy toward the end of the file:\n\n\nverifyproxy -\n gumsclient\ngumsclient -\n glexectracking\n\n\n\n\n\nor if you have do not have GUMS and want to use a gridmapfile, uncomment the following policy:\n\n\nverifyproxy -\n gridmapfile\ngridmapfile -\n glexectracking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting the Installation of glexec\n\n\nNow, \nas a non-privileged user (not root)\n, do the following (where \n is your VO, and \n is your uid as reported by \n/usr/bin/id\n):\n\n\nuser@host $\n voms-proxy-init -voms \nYOURVO\n:/\nYOURVO\n\n\nuser@host $\n \nexport\n \nGLEXEC_CLIENT_CERT\n=\n/tmp/x509up_u\nUID\n\n\nuser@host $\n \nexport\n \nX509_USER_PROXY\n=\n/tmp/x509up_u\nUID\n\n\nuser@host $\n /usr/sbin/glexec /usr/bin/id\n\nuser@host $\n \nuid\n=\n13160\n(\nfnalgrid\n)\n \ngid\n=\n9767\n(\nfnalgrid\n)\n \ngroups\n=\n65000\n(\nglexec00\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \nglexec\n is successful, it will print out the uid and gid that your proxy would normally be mapped to by your GUMS server, plus a supplementary tracking group. (The actual names and numbers will be different from what you see above.)\n\n\nGlexec log files\n\n\nGlexec sends all its log information by default to syslog. By default they go to \n/var/log/messages\n, but this may differ if you have customized your syslog setup. Here are some sample messages:\n\n\nApr 25 16:36:16 fermicloud053 glexec[2867]: lcmaps: lcmaps.mod-PluginInit(): plugin glexectracking not found (arguments: )\nApr 25 16:36:16 fermicloud053 glexec[2867]: lcmaps: lcmaps.mod-lcmaps_startPluginManager(): error initializing plugin: glexectracking\nApr 25 16:36:16 fermicloud053 glexec[2867]: lcmaps: lcmaps_init() error: could not start plugin manager\nApr 25 16:36:16 fermicloud053 glexec[2867]: Initialisation of LCMAPS failed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese particular messages are pretty common, caused by forgetting to uncomment the beginning of the \nglexectracking\n rule in \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n.\n\n\nIt is possible to redirect glexec log messages to a different file with standard syslog. To do that, choose one of the \nLOG_LOCAL[0-7]\n log facilities that are unused, for example \nLOG_LOCAL1\n. Then set the following in \n/etc/glexec.conf\n:\n\n\nsyslog_facility = LOG_LOCAL1\n\n\n\n\n\nand add a corresponding parameter to the \nlcmaps_glexec_tracking.mod\n entry in \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n:\n\n\n  \n-log-facility LOG_LOCAL1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen in \n/etc/rsyslog.conf\n, add a line like this:\n\n\nlocal1.* /var/log/glexec.log\n\n\n\n\n\nand also exclude those messages from \n/var/log/messages\n by adding \nlocal1.none\n after other wildcards on the existing \n/var/log/messages\n line, for example:\n\n\n*.info;local1.none;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none /var/log/messages\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to notify the system logger to re-read the configuration file with \nservice rsyslog restart\n.\n\n\nrsyslog\n, by default, limits the rate at which messages may be logged, and if maximum debugging is enabled in glexec this limit is reached. To avoid that, you can add the following to \n/etc/rsyslog.conf\n after the line \"$ModLoad imuxsock.so\":\n\n\n$SystemLogRateLimitInterval 0\n$SystemLogRateLimitBurst 0\n\n\n\n\n\nand do \nservice rsyslog restart\n.\n\n\nAlternatively, \nsyslog-ng\n (available in the EPEL repository) can do the same job by matching all the messages that have the string \"glexec\" in the name.\nThese rules in \n/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf\n will separate the glexec messages into \n/var/log/glexec.log\n:\n\n\ndestination d_glexec { file(\n/var/log/glexec.log\n); };\nfilter f_glexec { program(\n^glexec\n); };\nfilter f_notglexec { not program(\n^glexec\n); };\nlog { source(s_sys); filter(f_glexec); destination(d_glexec); };\n\n\n\n\n\nThen later, in the log rule writing sending to \nd_mesg\n, add a \nfilter(f_notglexec);\n before the destination rule to keep glexec messages out of \n/var/log/messages\n:\n\n\nlog { source(s_sys); filter(f_filter1); filter(f_notglexec); destination(d_mesg); };\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get Help?\n\n\nTo get assistance please use the \nHelp Procedure\n.",

Here are some sample messages:  Apr 25 16:36:16 fermicloud053 glexec[2867]: lcmaps: lcmaps.mod-PluginInit(): plugin glexectracking not found (arguments: )\nApr 25 16:36:16 fermicloud053 glexec[2867]: lcmaps: lcmaps.mod-lcmaps_startPluginManager(): error initializing plugin: glexectracking\nApr 25 16:36:16 fermicloud053 glexec[2867]: lcmaps: lcmaps_init() error: could not start plugin manager\nApr 25 16:36:16 fermicloud053 glexec[2867]: Initialisation of LCMAPS failed.  These particular messages are pretty common, caused by forgetting to uncomment the beginning of the  glexectracking  rule in  /etc/lcmaps.db .  It is possible to redirect glexec log messages to a different file with standard syslog. To do that, choose one of the  LOG_LOCAL[0-7]  log facilities that are unused, for example  LOG_LOCAL1 . Then set the following in  /etc/glexec.conf :  syslog_facility = LOG_LOCAL1  and add a corresponding parameter to the  lcmaps_glexec_tracking.mod  entry in  /etc/lcmaps.db :     -log-facility LOG_LOCAL1   Then in  /etc/rsyslog.conf , add a line like this:  local1.* /var/log/glexec.log  and also exclude those messages from  /var/log/messages  by adding  local1.none  after other wildcards on the existing  /var/log/messages  line, for example:  *.info;local1.none;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none /var/log/messages  Be sure to notify the system logger to re-read the configuration file with  service rsyslog restart .  rsyslog , by default, limits the rate at which messages may be logged, and if maximum debugging is enabled in glexec this limit is reached. To avoid that, you can add the following to  /etc/rsyslog.conf  after the line \"$ModLoad imuxsock.so\":  $SystemLogRateLimitInterval 0\n$SystemLogRateLimitBurst 0  and do  service rsyslog restart .  Alternatively,  syslog-ng  (available in the EPEL repository) can do the same job by matching all the messages that have the string \"glexec\" in the name.\nThese rules in  /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf  will separate the glexec messages into  /var/log/glexec.log :  destination d_glexec { file( /var/log/glexec.log ); };\nfilter f_glexec { program( ^glexec ); };\nfilter f_notglexec { not program( ^glexec ); };\nlog { source(s_sys); filter(f_glexec); destination(d_glexec); };  Then later, in the log rule writing sending to  d_mesg , add a  filter(f_notglexec);  before the destination rule to keep glexec messages out of  /var/log/messages :  log { source(s_sys); filter(f_filter1); filter(f_notglexec); destination(d_mesg); };",

Support is scheduled to end as of May 2018.\n\n\n\n\nThis document is for VO System Administrators.\n\n\nHere we describe how to install and configure VOMS on your Linux machine. When you install VOMS as described here, you get all three parts: MySQL database, VOMS admin and VOMS server. Instructions for creating your VO are also on this page, in the configuration section.\n\n\nWe also describe how to remove a VO from VOMS if the need arises.\n\n\nThe installation section will give you a bare-bones installation. In order to use VOMS you need to go through the configuration: run \nconfigure_voms\n to create your VO, probably enable read-only access to your VO and probably set a VO-admin to add/remove users. The other sections help in troubleshooting and knowing what is running.\n\n\nThis is not a complete reference. If you need to administer a VO, please check the \nVOMS User guide\n linked also in the \nreference\n section.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe \nVirtual Organization Membership Service\n allows to manage the members of a VO and their privileges (groups and roles). It has three main parts:\n\n\n\n\nMySQL database which is a persistent repository for VO membership information,\n\n\nVOMS admin which provides the Web UI/services to maintain the VO membership. This requires Apache/Tomcat.\n\n\nVOMS server, a daemon process which services the \nvoms-proxy-init\n requests.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nHost and OS\n\n\n\n\nA host to install the VOMS Service (Pristine node)\n\n\nOS is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and variants (see \ndetails...\n). Currently most of our testing has been done on Scientific Linux 5.\n\n\nTime must be synchronized (e.g. \nntpd\n). \n\n\nRoot access\n\n\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nThe VOMS and voms-admin installation will create two users unless they are already created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\n\nDefault uid\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvoms\n\n\nnone\n\n\nRuns the VOMS daemons, one per VO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntomcat\n\n\n91\n\n\nRuns tomcat6 and owns voms-admin configuration and certificates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if uid 91 is already taken but not used for the tomcat user, you will experience errors. \nDetails...\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\nYou will need two service certificates. \nHere\n are instructions to request a host certificate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\n\nUser that owns certificate\n\n\nPath to certificate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOMS service certificate\n\n\nvoms\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/voms/vomscert.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/voms/vomskey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomcat service certificate\n\n\ntomcat\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService Name\n\n\nProtocol\n\n\nPort Number\n\n\nInbound\n\n\nOutbound\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOMS\n\n\ntcp\n\n\n15001+\n\n\nY\n\n\n\n\nrange of ports, increment by 1 for each VO supported\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOMS Admin\n\n\ntcp\n\n\n8443\n\n\nY\n\n\n\n\nVOMS Admin (which runs within Tomcat) web interface, it must be available to VO administrators and users registering online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n* 15001 is the port specified in the \nconfiguration command\n. You can choose a different one or have multiple ones if you support multiple VOs.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Requirements\n\n\n\n\nTesting requirements:\n\n\nThe Subject and Issuer of a voms admin certificate (it could be your certificate)\n\n\nAccess to your own certificate if you want to create your voms proxy\n\n\nYour certificate uploaded into a browser if you want to test voms-admin WEB UI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe configuration and testing require some familiarity with openssl commands, e.g. to extract the subject (DN) and the issuer of a certificate. If you are not familiar please check the guides in the \nreference section\n:\n\n\n\n\nInstallation Procedure\n\n\nInstall VOMS\n\n\n\n\nInstall Java using \nthese instructions\n\n\n\n\nInstall OSG-VOMS:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ yum install osg-voms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure\n\n\nThe configuration requires some initial steps plus the addition of one or more VO. You will not be able to start voms-admin if you don't add at least one VO.\n\n\nConfigure MySQL Database\n\n\nBefore you will be able configure VOMS you will need to have access to MySQL database. The MySQL software is installed with the \nosg-voms\n package. By default it will be using port 3306 and will not have password for \nroot\n.\n\n\nIt is not necessary to change the port number if you don't want to. If you want to modify the port you will need to edit \n/etc/my.cnf\n file and add a new port:\n\n\n[mysqld]\n\n\ndatadir\n=\n/var/lib/mysql\n\n\nsocket\n=\n/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\n\n\nport\n=\nMYSQL_PORT_NUMBER\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is wise to set a password for the \nroot\n user. Run the following command to set the password:\n\n\n[root@voms ~]$\n /etc/init.d/mysqld start\n\n[root@voms ~]$\n mysqladmin -u root password top_secret\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup the Service Certificates\n\n\nMake sure that you have the host, VOMS and Tomcat service certificates/keys in the right directories and with the correct owners and permissions (\n600\n for key and \n644\n the certificate). \nHost certificate\n is required and must be in \n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n and \nhostkey.pem\n. It is recommended to provide also service certificates for VOMS and Tomcat. If you don't, here are the instructions to copy the host certificate/key and set the correct owner (permissions are preserved). Note that if you did not previously have a voms or tomcat user on your system, they were added during the RPM install:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOMS-core daemon is running as user \nvoms\n and requires its service certificate and key in \n/etc/grid-security/voms\n. To copy the host certificate/key for this service, you need to do the following:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ cd /etc/grid-security\n[root@voms ~]$ cp hostcert.pem voms/vomscert.pem\n[root@voms ~]$ cp hostkey.pem voms/vomskey.pem\n[root@voms ~]$ chown -R voms:voms voms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomcat service is running as user \ntomcat\n and requires its service certificate and key in \n/etc/grid-security/http\n. To copy the host certificate/key for this service, you need to do the following:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ cd /etc/grid-security\n[root@voms ~]$ mkdir /etc/grid-security/http\n[root@voms ~]$ cp hostcert.pem http/httpcert.pem\n[root@voms ~]$ cp hostkey.pem http/httpkey.pem\n[root@voms ~]$ chown -R tomcat:tomcat http\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Tomcat options\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf\n to add the following line to the bottom of the file. This is important for good performance and essential if you run more than one VO.\n\n\nCATALINA_OPTS=\n${\nCATALINA_OPTS\n}\n -XX:MaxPermSize=256m\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you run a large number of VOs, you might need to increase the amount of memory used by Tomcat. You can do this by adding one more line to the bottom of \n/etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf\n:\n\n\nJAVA_OPTS=\n${\nJAVA_OPTS\n}\n -Xmx2048m\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must add the following line to \n/etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf\n to use VOMS-Admin successfully:\n\n\nJAVA_ENDORSED_DIRS=\n${\nJAVA_ENDORSED_DIRS\n}\n:/usr/share/voms-admin/endorsed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable SSLv3 in Tomcat\n\n\nThe OSG Security team has concluded that the POODLE SSLv3 vulnerability is not a \ncritical\n concern to OSG software installations. Most services are not affected, and those that are affected are difficult to exploit in a meaningful way. Nonetheless, the recommendation is to disable support for SSLv3 where reasonable.\n\n\nOSG software includes VOMS Admin Server (currently, version 2.7.0), which runs within Tomcat. By default Tomcat allows SSLv3 connections, but that is easy to change. To disable SSLv3 support from a Tomcat instance that contains VOMS Admin Server, set \nprotocols=\"TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2\"\n in \n/etc/tomcat[56]/server.xml\n, as shown below.\n\n\nNote: OSG Software has tested this change only for Tomcat and VOMS Admin Server. But this is a server-level Tomcat configuration change and thus affects all Tomcat web applications running on the same server. For now, we recommend making this change to Tomcat servers that run only VOMS Admin Server. There are known issues with applying this change to a Tomcat instance that runs GUMS, in that dCache clients (at least) fail to work with the changed GUMS server.\n\n\n--- server.xml.old      2014-10-28 11:27:11.000000000 -0500\n\n\n+++ server.xml  2014-10-28 11:29:34.000000000 -0500\n\n\n@@ -20,19 +20,20 @@\n\n     \nConnector port=\n8443\n SSLEnabled=\ntrue\n\n               maxThreads=\n150\n minSpareThreads=\n25\n maxSpareThreads=\n75\n\n               enableLookups=\nfalse\n disableUploadTimeout=\ntrue\n\n               acceptCount=\n100\n debug=\n0\n scheme=\nhttps\n secure=\ntrue\n\n               sSLImplementation=\norg.glite.security.trustmanager.tomcat.TMSSLImplementation\n\n               trustStoreDir=\n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n               sslCertFile=\n/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem\n\n               sslKey=\n/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem\n\n               crlUpdateInterval=\n2h\n\n               log4jConfFile=\n/usr/share/tomcat6/conf/log4j-trustmanager.properties\n\n               clientAuth=\ntrue\n sslProtocol=\nTLS\n sslEnabledProtocols=\nTLSv1\n\n\n+              protocols=\nTLSv1.1,TLSv1.2\n\n               crlEnabled=\ntrue\n crlRequired=\ntrue\n/\n\n\n    \nEngine name=\nCatalina\n defaultHost=\nlocalhost\n\n\n      \nHost name=\nlocalhost\n appBase=\nwebapps\n /\n\n    \n/Engine\n\n  \n/Service\n\n\n/Server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllow Tomcat to have more open files and processes\n\n\nIf you run several VOs, you may need to extend the limits for Tomcat so that it can open more file and create more processes. To do this, add the following lines to \n/etc/security/limits.conf\n:\n\n\ntomcat          soft    nofile  63536\ntomcat          hard    nofile  63536\n\ntomcat          soft    nproc   16384\ntomcat          hard    nproc   16384\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this is not needed if you are running just a single VO, this is only needed if you run many VOs.\n\n\nConfigure Trust Manager\n\n\nConfigure Tomcat's trust manager. This must be done once, before starting up Tomcat for the first time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to configure Tomcat in order to enable EMI trustmanager:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ /var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/configure.sh\nInfo: using default install root: /\nInfo: using default configuration file: //var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/config.properties\nInfo: using default configuration directory: //var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat\nInfo: you can clean up using the following commands\n      mv -f /etc/tomcat5/server.xml.old-trustmanager /etc/tomcat5/server.xml\n      rm -f /usr/share/tomcat5/server/lib/bcprov*.jar\n      rm -f /usr/share/tomcat5/server/lib/log4j*.jar\n      rm -f /usr/share/tomcat5/server/lib/trustmanager-*.jar\n      rm -f /etc/tomcat5/log4j-trustmanager.properties\n      rm -f //var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/server.xml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(the output may look different on EL6)\n\n\nConfigure Email Services for the VOMS Server\n\n\nThe VOMS server may need to send administrative emails. To enable this feature \non EL 6 systems\n, you must complete a one-time initialization of Java email services within Tomcat:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the \nbuild-jar-repository\n command:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ /usr/bin/build-jar-repository /usr/share/tomcat6/lib javamail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the hostname for reminder e-mails in \n/etc/voms-admin/VO_NAME/voms.service.properties\n:\n\n\nfile\nvoms.hostname = \nhostname\n\n\nReplacing \n with the public hostname of your VOMS server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEL 5 systems are already configured to use Java email services.\n\n\nAdd and configure a VO\n\n\nYou must add at least one VO before you can start VOMS Admin. You must start the services as instructed during the configuration steps. You can stop them at the end if you don't want them running yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \nvoms-admin-configure\n script to create a new VO. Note that if you have multiple VOs, each VO must have a unique VOMS_PORT\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ voms-admin-configure install \\\n    --dbtype mysql \\\n    --vo VO_NAME \\\n    --createdb \\\n    --deploy-database  \\\n    --dbauser root  \\\n    --dbapwd MYSQL_ROOT_PASSD \\\n    --dbusername  admin-VO_NAME \\\n    --dbpassword secret  \\\n    --dbport  DB_PORT \\\n    --port VOMS_PORT  \\\n    --mail-from email \\\n    --smtp-host smtp.domain \\\n    --sqlloc /usr/lib64/voms/libvomsmysql.so \\\n    --cert /etc/grid-security/voms/vomscert.pem \\\n    --key  /etc/grid-security/voms/vomskey.pem \\\n    --read-access-for-authenticated-clients\n\n\nFor example for the test1 VO:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ voms-admin-configure install --dbtype mysql --vo test1 --createdb \\\n     --deploy-database --dbauser root --dbapwd  top_secret \\\n     --dbusername admin_test1 --dbpassword secret --dbport 3306 \\\n     --port 15001 --mail-from tlevshin@fnal.gov --smtp-host smtp.fnal.gov \\\n     --sqlloc /usr/lib64/voms/libvomsmysql.so --cert /etc/grid-security/voms/vomscert.pem \\\n     --key  /etc/grid-security/voms/vomskey.pem --read-access-for-authenticated-clients\n\n\nIf the command fails with a \nIOError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe\n error, check that you entered the correct database password.\nIf the above command is executed correctly a lot of sql stuff will scroll across the screen, followed by\n\n\n``` console\nDeploying voms database...\nDatabase deployed correctly!\n\n\nVO test1 installation finished.\n\n\nYou can start the voms services using the following commands:\n    /etc/init.d/voms start test1\n    /etc/init.d/voms-admin start test1\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart VOMS and VOMS Admin for the VO you just added:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ /sbin/service voms start VO_NAME\n[root@voms ~]$ /sbin/service voms-admin start VO_NAME\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ /sbin/service voms start test1\n[root@voms ~]$ /sbin/service voms-admin start test1\n\n\nNote that the voms-admin init script really isn't an init script. Instead it deploys a Tomcat webapp into Tomcat. In normal usage, you never need to run this command again, and you should \nnot\n run \n/sbin/service voms-admin stop VO_NAME\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a local admin:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ /usr/sbin/voms-db-deploy.py add-admin --vo VO_NAME  \\\n        --dn  HOST_CERT_SUBJECT \\\n        --ca HOST_CERT_ISSUER\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ /usr/sbin/voms-db-deploy.py add-admin --vo test1 \\\n     --dn /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=fermicloud002.fnal.gov \\\n     --ca \"/DC=org/DC=DOEGrids/OU=Certificate Authorities/CN=DOEGrids CA 1\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to complete the next step you need to start also Tomcat if it is not already running. And since Tomcat requires valid CRLs you need to fetch the CRLs if it is a fresh installation they are not there:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ /usr/sbin/fetch-crl  # If there are no CRLs in /etc/grid-security/certificates\n[root@voms ~]$ /sbin/service tomcat6 start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure VOMS Admin to allow GUMS and edg-mkgridmap to query your VO for the set of users. Note that you must have a valid certificate; voms-admin needs a certificate authorized to perform the operation (ACL editing) on the VO:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ voms-admin --nousercert --vo VO_NAME add-ACL-entry /VO_NAME ANYONE VOMS_CA \"CONTAINER_READ,MEMBERSHIP_READ\" true\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ voms-admin --nousercert --vo test1 add-ACL-entry /test1 ANYONE VOMS_CA \"CONTAINER_READ,MEMBERSHIP_READ\" true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllow compatibility with \nGUMS\n and \nedg-mkgridmap\n. Edit \n/etc/voms-admin/VO_NAME/voms.service.properties\n by adding the following line to the file:\n\n\nconsole\nvoms.csrf.log_only = true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't want to leave your services running you can stop them after you are done with adding the VO:\n\n\n[root@voms ~]$\n /sbin/service voms stop\n\n[root@voms ~]$\n /sbin/service tomcat6 stop\n\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\n\nVOMS has its persistent repository in a MySQL database, that requires \nmysql\n to be running in order to be queried. All grid interactions require updated CA certificates and CRLs. Then the \nvoms server\n is a daemon servicing authentication requests and \nvoms-admin\n, requiring Tomcat, is a Web UI/service to manage the VO membership.\n\n\nStarting and Enabling Services\n\n\nTo start VOMS you need to start several services:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMySQL server needs to be running if it is not already:\n\n\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ /sbin/service mysqld start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart voms server\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ service voms start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Tomcat, required by voms-admin:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ service tomcat6 start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should also enable the appropriate services so that they are automatically started when your system is powered on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable the other services:\n\n\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig mysqld on\n[root@voms ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig voms on\n[root@voms ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig tomcat6 on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: You do \nnot\n need to run chkconfig on the voms-admin service. This service is only need to do the initial \"deployment\" of the VOMS Admin service into Tomcat and is not needed thereafter unless you add another VO.\n\n\nStopping and Disabling Services\n\n\nTo stop VOMS you need to stop voms and voms-admin, and also the services they use if nothing else is using them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop voms server\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ service voms stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Stop Tomcat, if no other application is using it:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ service tomcat6 stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop MySQL server if no other application is using it:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ service mysqld stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, you can disable services by running the following commands. However, you don't need to do this normally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo disable the other services:\n\n\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig mysqld off\n[root@voms ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig voms off\n[root@voms ~]$ /sbin/chkconfig tomcat6 off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou do not need to run chkconfig on the voms-admin service. See above for more details.\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise your VOMS server\n\n\nA working VOMS server can be contacted to sign certificates extensions (e.g., by \nvoms-proxy-init\n) or to verify VO memberships only if it is on the list of valid VOMS servers (\n/etc/vomses\n) and if there is an LSC file for that VO. Some grid services (glite-FTS and glite-WMS) even require a copy of the VOMS server certificate.\n\n\nThe file \n/etc/vomses\n contains a list of VOs and their VOMS servers. A VOMS server may appear on multiple lines if it is serving multiple VOs on different ports. All lines contain:\n\n\nalias\n \nHOST_NAME\n \nPORT\n \nHOST_DN\n \nVO_NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\ntest1\n \nfermicloud002.fnal.gov\n \n15001\n \n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=fermicloud002.fnal.gov\n \ntest1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nLSC file\n (LiSt of Certificates) is another description of your VOMS server:\n\n\n\n\nIt is located in \n$X509_VOMS_DIR/${VO}\n, by default \n/etc/grid-security/vomsdir/${VO}\n\n\nThe filename is the fully qualified hostname (FQDN) of your server, followed by \n.lsc\n\n\nThe first line contains the subject DN of the VOMS server host certificate, without quotes\n\n\nThe second line contains the subject DN of the CA that issued the VOMS server host certificate, also without quotes\n\n\n\n\nFor example, for the VO named \ntest1\n hosted on \nfermicloud002\n, the LSC file named \n/etc/grid-security/vomsdir/test1/fermicloud002.fnal.gov.lsc\n might contain:\n\n\n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=fermicloud002.fnal.gov\n/DC=org/DC=DOEGrids/OU=Certificate Authorities/CN=DOEGrids CA 1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe VOMS server manager must distribute the line for \n/etc/vomses\n and the LSC file to all hosts that will contact the VOMS server. OSG distributes with all its client and server installations a default list of VOMS servers (\n/etc/vomses\n) and a default set of LSC files. These are part of the \nvo-client\n RPM.\n\n\nTo be included, use the VO Registration function at \nOIM VO Registration\n. Even if you are already registered as a VO you need to notify the Grid Operations Center if the information in the vomses file or the LSC file has changed.\n\n\nTest\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBefore performing any of the tests you must start all the services as \ndescribed above\n\n\n\n\nTo test VOMS you can add a member (her/his certificate) to a VO using voms-admin, login in the Web UI and then:\n\n\n\n\nuse the voms server to generate a proxy for that certificate.\n\n\nor generate a grid-mapfile\n\n\nor query with GUMS\n\n\n\n\nVoms-admin test\n\n\nAdd a member(yourself) to the VO:\n\n\n[root@voms ~]$\n voms-admin --vo VO_NAME --host HOST_NAME \n\\\n\n       --nousercert create-user USER_CERT_SUBJECT USER_CERT_ISSUER \n\\\n\n       USER_COMMON_NAME email \n\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n[root@voms ~]$\n voms-admin --vo test1 --host fermicloud002 --nousercert create-user \n\\\n\n   \n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Joe Doe 12345\n \n/DC=org/DC=DOEGrids/OU=Certificate Authorities/CN=DOEGrids CA 1\n \n\n   \nJoe Doe 12345\n \njdoe@fnal.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssign VOAdmin role to yourself, so you can manage the VO using the Web UI:\n\n\nvoms-admin --vo VO_NAME --host HOST_NAME \\\n\n\n    --nousercert assign-role  /VO_NAME  VO-Admin  \\\n\n\n      USER_CERT_SUBJECT USRT_CERT_ISSUER \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n[root@voms ~]$\n voms-admin --vo test1 --host fermicloud002 --nousercert assign-role /test1   VO-Admin  \n\\\n\n   \n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Joe Doe 12345\n \n/DC=org/DC=DOEGrids/OU=Certificate Authorities/CN=DOEGrids CA 1\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the Web UI by accessing \nhttps://hostname:8443/voms/voname\n. If you have your certificate loaded into the browser you will be able to manage the VO.\n\n\nVoms-core test:\n\n\nTo perform this test you need the \nvoms-client\n RPM.\n\n\nTo use your VOMS you need to add a line with its description (similar to the following) to \n/etc/vomses\n, a file containing a list of all valid voms servers:\n\n\nalias\n \nHOST_NAME\n \nPORT\n \nHOST DN\n \nVO_NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at \n/etc/voms-admin/VO_NAME/vomses\n to find the correct line for your VO. For example:\n\n\ntest1\n \nfermicloud002.fnal.gov\n \n15001\n \n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=fermicloud002.fnal.gov\n \ntest1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it is not there already, add your certificate to the VO using \nvoms-admin\n \ncreate-user\n as in the previous section. Being the local admin set with \nvoms-db-deploy.py add-admin\n does not add the certificate to the VO.\n\n\nUse \nvoms-proxy-init\n to generate proxy. Login as user, create \nvomses\n file (e.g. \n~/.vomses\n). Generate voms proxy\n\n\n[user@voms ~]$\n voms-proxy-init -voms VO_NAME -vomses ~/vomses\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting edg-mkgridmap\n\n\nThe \nedg-mkgridmap\n command is run on a site's Compute Element node to generate a \ngrid-mapfile\n file. This script is not provided as a part of the VOMS installation, so you will have to go on a CE node to test this. You do not have to be the \nroot\n user on the CE node, but you will need to have a personal certificate available.\n\n\nThe \nmkgridmap\n file syntax/values for each VO you create, can be viewed on the WEB UI for your VO by selecting \nConfiguration information\n on the left hand menu of the main page. You will get a line like:\n\n\n group vomss://HOST_NAME:8443/voms/VO_NAME  group_name\n\n\n\n\n\ne.g. for the OSG VO :\n\n\n group vomss://cms-xen3.fnal.gov:8443/voms/OSG  osg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \nosg\n (3rd token) is an EDG format for the account name. You will likely want to change it to the group unix account you want assigned for your CE node. The example above is for a \ngroup\n account assignment.\n\n\n\n\nTo test, you will need to do this on a CE node where the authorization mode is \"gridmap\" (lcmaps or PRIMA are not enabled):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulate \n/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf\n with the example configuration file on your VOMS server. It will be the only entry.\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ echo 'group vomss://cms-xen3.fnal.gov:8443/voms/OSG  osg' \n /etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecute edg-mkgridmap:\n\n\nconsole\n[root@voms ~]$ edg-mkgridmap\n  ... the output will be in /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile and will look as follows ...\n  \"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491\"  vdt\n  \"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cms-xen3.fnal.gov\"  vdt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find more in the \ncompute element install document\n.\n\n\nTesting the GUMS interface\n\n\nThe GUMS authorization server periodically 'pulls' the VO membership data for it's authorization and account assignment functions from the various VO's VOMS servers.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way of testing this except with an installed GUMS server which this document does not address.\n\n\nSee the \nGUMS install guide\n for more information.\n\n\nRemoving a VO\n\n\nIf you added the VO just for testing purposes, you can remove it using \nvoms-admin-configure remove --vo VONAME\n as documented in the \nuser guide\n, e.g.:\n\n\n#\n# Stop the service \n\n\n[root@voms ~]$\n service voms-admin stop test1\n\n[root@voms ~]$\n service voms stop test1  \n\n#\n# Remove it.\n\n\n[root@voms ~]$\n voms-admin-configure remove --vo test1 --undeploy-database --dropdb --dbapwd top_secret\n\nvoms-admin-configure, version 2.6.1\n\n\n\nRemoving vo  test1\n\n\nVO test1 succesfully removed.\n\n\n#\n# Restart to update the voms-server webpage \n\n\n[root@voms ~]$\n service tomcat6 restart\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the --undeploy-database and --dropdb will remove the database that stores all the membership information. You cannot undo this option. If you're not quite sure that you really want to remove the database, then do not pass this option. The VO will be unaccessible and unusable, but the membership information will be retained in case you recreate the VO later.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nUseful configuration and log files\n\n\nConfiguration Files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService or Process\n\n\nConfiguration File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvoms\n\n\n/etc/voms/VO_NAME/voms.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/voms/VO_NAME/voms.pass\n\n\nVOMS server configuration and password for the VO database\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvoms-admin\n\n\n/etc/voms-admin/voms-siblings.xml\n\n\nAuxiliary voms-admin application configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/voms-admin/VO_NAME/logback.runtime.xml\n\n\nLogging configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/voms-admin/VO_NAME/vo-aup.txt\n\n\nVO acceptable use policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/voms-admin/VO_NAME/voms-admin-VO_NAME.xml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/voms-admin/VO_NAME/voms.service.properties\n\n\nVOMS Admin configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/voms-admin/VO_NAME/voms.database.properties\n\n\nVO database handler configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/voms-admin/VO_NAME/vomses\n\n\nvomses line\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmysql\n\n\n/var/lib/mysql/VO_NAME\n\n\nVOMS database for the VO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/my.cnf\n\n\nMySQL configuration, e.g. server port\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntomcat\n\n\n/etc/tomcat6/\n\n\nTomcat configuration files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/tomcat6/Catalina/localhost/*\n\n\nVOMS related tomcat configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService or Process\n\n\nLog File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/log/tomcat5/voms-admin-VO_NAME.log\n\n\nThis is the vo-by-vo log for voms-admin Web UI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/log/tomcat5/trustmanager.log\n\n\nThe trustmanager handles things related to authentication.

Tomcat by default constructs the absolute URLs in the web pages using the hostname/IP and port used for the request. If the server resides behind a Firewall or NAT that enforces port redirection, these may be the server IP or the port on the private network, that likely are not reachable by your Web browser. To fix the problem you must use \nTomcat's proxy support\n by setting \nproxyName\n and/or \nproxyPort\n in Tomcat's configuration file (\n/etc/tomcat5/server.xml\n).\n\n\nAfter changing \nserver.xml\n \nstop and restart\n Tomcat in order for the changes to take effect.\n\n\nHow to get Help?\n\n\nTo get assistance please use \nHelp Procedure\n.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nEMI documentation:\n\n\n\n\nEMI VOMS documentation\n\n\nVOMS Admin User Guide\n\n\nVOMS System Admin Guide\n\n\nHow to configure VOMS LSC files\n\n\n\n\nOpenssl commands:\n\n\nhttp://security.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/grid-howtos/usefulopenssl.html",

Most services are not affected, and those that are affected are difficult to exploit in a meaningful way. Nonetheless, the recommendation is to disable support for SSLv3 where reasonable.  OSG software includes VOMS Admin Server (currently, version 2.7.0), which runs within Tomcat. By default Tomcat allows SSLv3 connections, but that is easy to change. To disable SSLv3 support from a Tomcat instance that contains VOMS Admin Server, set  protocols=\"TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2\"  in  /etc/tomcat[56]/server.xml , as shown below.  Note: OSG Software has tested this change only for Tomcat and VOMS Admin Server. But this is a server-level Tomcat configuration change and thus affects all Tomcat web applications running on the same server. For now, we recommend making this change to Tomcat servers that run only VOMS Admin Server. There are known issues with applying this change to a Tomcat instance that runs GUMS, in that dCache clients (at least) fail to work with the changed GUMS server.  --- server.xml.old      2014-10-28 11:27:11.000000000 -0500  +++ server.xml  2014-10-28 11:29:34.000000000 -0500  @@ -20,19 +20,20 @@ \n      Connector port= 8443  SSLEnabled= true \n               maxThreads= 150  minSpareThreads= 25  maxSpareThreads= 75 \n               enableLookups= false  disableUploadTimeout= true \n               acceptCount= 100  debug= 0  scheme= https  secure= true \n               sSLImplementation= org.glite.security.trustmanager.tomcat.TMSSLImplementation \n               trustStoreDir= /etc/grid-security/certificates \n               sslCertFile= /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem \n               sslKey= /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem \n               crlUpdateInterval= 2h \n               log4jConfFile= /usr/share/tomcat6/conf/log4j-trustmanager.properties \n               clientAuth= true  sslProtocol= TLS  sslEnabledProtocols= TLSv1  +              protocols= TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2 \n               crlEnabled= true  crlRequired= true / \n\n     Engine name= Catalina  defaultHost= localhost \n\n       Host name= localhost  appBase= webapps  / \n     /Engine \n   /Service  /Server",

Edit  /etc/voms-admin/VO_NAME/voms.service.properties  by adding the following line to the file:  console\nvoms.csrf.log_only = true    If you don't want to leave your services running you can stop them after you are done with adding the VO:  [root@voms ~]$  /sbin/service voms stop [root@voms ~]$  /sbin/service tomcat6 stop",

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

            "text": "OSG Software Release 3.3.30\n\n\nRelease Date\n: 2017-11-14\n\n\nSummary of changes\n\n\nThis release contains:\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nStashCache is supported on EL7 only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nxrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-1 on EL6.\n\n\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details.\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\n\n\nUpdates to VOMS admin server require the updated emi-trustmanager-tomcat and re-running the configure script:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/configure.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOMS admin server shows an error when modifying/adding/signing AUPs, but all the actions still work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter updating OSG-CE to version 3.3-12, please disable and remove OSG Info Services via the following procedure:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service osg-info-services stop\n\nroot@host #\n yum erase gip osg-info-services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: \npkgurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages\n has been replaced by \ntopurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu\n and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds \npkgurl\n. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build \n \n1.8.0\n, rerun \nosg-koji setup\n, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA previous version (\n1.17.0-2.5\n) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison \n1.17.0-2.6\n and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in \ncondor_config.local\n or a new file in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n directory. Delete these lines and run \ncondor_reconfig\n.\n\n\n# GlideinWMS Gratia commands\n\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n \n=\n /var/lib/gratia/data\n\nJOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n=\n$$\n([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\\nLocal Job\\\n, TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build    1.8.0 , rerun  osg-koji setup , and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details.\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the November release.\n\n\n\n\nUpdates to VOMS admin server require the updated emi-trustmanager-tomcat and re-running the configure script:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/configure.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOMS admin server shows an error when modifying/adding/signing AUPs, but all the actions still work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter updating OSG-CE to version 3.3-12, please disable and remove OSG Info Services via the following procedure:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service osg-info-services stop\n\nroot@host #\n yum erase gip osg-info-services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: \npkgurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages\n has been replaced by \ntopurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu\n and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds \npkgurl\n. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build \n \n1.8.0\n, rerun \nosg-koji setup\n, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA previous version (\n1.17.0-2.5\n) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison \n1.17.0-2.6\n and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in \ncondor_config.local\n or a new file in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n directory. Delete these lines and run \ncondor_reconfig\n.\n\n\n# GlideinWMS Gratia commands\n\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n \n=\n /var/lib/gratia/data\n\nJOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n=\n$$\n([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\\nLocal Job\\\n, TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the October release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details.\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the October release.\n\n\n\n\nUpdates to VOMS admin server require the updated emi-trustmanager-tomcat and re-running the configure script:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/configure.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOMS admin server shows an error when modifying/adding/signing AUPs, but all the actions still work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter updating OSG-CE to version 3.3-12, please disable and remove OSG Info Services via the following procedure:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service osg-info-services stop\n\nroot@host #\n yum erase gip osg-info-services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: \npkgurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages\n has been replaced by \ntopurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu\n and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds \npkgurl\n. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build \n \n1.8.0\n, rerun \nosg-koji setup\n, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA previous version (\n1.17.0-2.5\n) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison \n1.17.0-2.6\n and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in \ncondor_config.local\n or a new file in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n directory. Delete these lines and run \ncondor_reconfig\n.\n\n\n# GlideinWMS Gratia commands\n\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n \n=\n /var/lib/gratia/data\n\nJOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n=\n$$\n([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\\nLocal Job\\\n, TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository. Note that in some cases, there are multiple RPMs for each package. You can click on any given package to see the set of RPMs or see the complete list below.\n\n\nEnterprise Linux

This warning can safely be ignored.  Using the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test ( SOFTWARE-2763 ). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the October release.   Updates to VOMS admin server require the updated emi-trustmanager-tomcat and re-running the configure script:  root@host #  /var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/configure.sh    VOMS admin server shows an error when modifying/adding/signing AUPs, but all the actions still work.    After updating OSG-CE to version 3.3-12, please disable and remove OSG Info Services via the following procedure:  root@host #  service osg-info-services stop root@host #  yum erase gip osg-info-services    The Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji:  pkgurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages  has been replaced by  topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu  and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds  pkgurl . To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build    1.8.0 , rerun  osg-koji setup , and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.    A previous version ( 1.17.0-2.5 ) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison  1.17.0-2.6  and later of the probes.

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details.\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n).

Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details.\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the August release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

Specifically, the varied authentication solutions proved to be good candidates for consolidation and a new piece of software, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, has been designed to replace both edg-mkgridmap and GUMS.\n\n\nSee \ninstall the LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n to replace GUMS + edg-mkgridmap.\n\n\nSee \nmigrating from edg-mkgridmap to lcmaps VOMS plugin\n to transistion from edg-mkgridmap.\n\n\nIn 3.4.0, we dropped HDFS 2.x with the intention of adding HDFS 3.x in a subsequent OSG 3.4 release when it becomes available upstream.\n\n\nIn addition to GUMS, edg-mkgridmap, and HDFS 2.x, we dropped packages related to the following software:\n\n\n\n\nVOMS Admin Server \u2212 \nRetirement Policy\n\n\nBeStMan \u2212 replaced by \nLoad Balanced GridFTP\n\n\nGLExec \u2212 replaced by \nSingularty\n\n\nGlobus GRAM \u2212 available from EPEL\n\n\nGIP and OSG Info Services \u2212 BDII servers retired\n\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned packages are still be available in OSG 3.3 and will receive regular support until December 2017 and security updates until June 2018 per our \nrelease policy\n. See \nthis section\n for the complete list of packages removed from OSG 3.4.\n\n\n OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components. \n StashCache is supported on EL7 only. \n xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.\n\n\nSummary of changes\n\n\nThis release contains:\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4.0\n\n\nHTCondor 8.6.3\n: See \nUpgrading from 8.4\n for additional information\n\n\nFrontier squid 3.5.24-3.1\n: See \nUpgrading from 2.x to 3.x\n for additional information\n\n\nUpdate to \nXRootD 4.6.1\n\n\nUpdate to xrootd-lcmaps 1.3.3 for EL7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate StashCache meta-packages to require XRootD 4.6.1\n\n\nUpdate to \nGlideinWMS 3.2.19\n\n\nFrontier squid 3.5.24-3.1\n: See \nUpgrading from 2.x to 3.x\n for additional information\n\n\nMake the LCMAPS VOMS plugin consider only the first FQAN to be consistent with GUMS\n\n\nHTCondor-CE: Add WholeNodeWanted ClassAd expression so jobs can request a whole node from the batch system\n\n\nHTCondor 8.6.3\n: See \nUpgrading from 8.4\n for additional information\n\n\nOSG CE 3.4\n\n\nAdd vo-client-lcmaps-voms dependency\n\n\nRemove gridftp dependency\n\n\nDrop client tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd vo-client-lcmaps-voms dependency to osg-gridftp\n\n\nFix osg-update-vos script to clean yum cache in order pick up the latest vo-client RPM\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts now refers to repo.grid.iu.edu (rather than the retired software.grid.iu.edu)\n\n\nosg-configure 2.0.0\n\n\nreject empty \nallowed_vos\n in subclusters\n\n\nget default \nallowed_vos\n from LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n\n\nissue warning (rather than error out) if OSG_APP or OSG_DATA directories are not present\n\n\ndrop 'RSV is not installed' warning\n\n\nremove configure-osg alias\n\n\ndeprecate GUMS support\n\n\ndisable GRAM configuration\n\n\ndrop managedfork and network modules\n\n\ndrop glexec support\n\n\nremove nonfunctional osg-cleanup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrop glexec and java from osg-wn-client\n\n\nBeSTMan 2 is no longer part of the OSG Software Stack\n\n\nGUMS is no longer part of the OSG Software Stack\n\n\nedg-mkgridmap in no longer part of the OSG Software Stack\n\n\nDrop bestman2 and globus*run RSV metrics\n\n\nosg-build 1.10.0\n\n\ndrop vdt-build alias\n\n\ndrop ~/.osg-build.ini configuration file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, OSG 3.4 CEs cannot be configured to authenticate via GUMS (\nSOFTWARE-2482\n). This issue is expected to be fixed in the July release.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the July release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nTo update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on \nupdating between release series\n.\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

            "text": "The OSG 3.4.0 software stack features a more streamlined and consolidated package list. Specifically, the varied authentication solutions proved to be good candidates for consolidation and a new piece of software, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, has been designed to replace both edg-mkgridmap and GUMS.  See  install the LCMAPS VOMS plugin  to replace GUMS + edg-mkgridmap.  See  migrating from edg-mkgridmap to lcmaps VOMS plugin  to transistion from edg-mkgridmap.  In 3.4.0, we dropped HDFS 2.x with the intention of adding HDFS 3.x in a subsequent OSG 3.4 release when it becomes available upstream.  In addition to GUMS, edg-mkgridmap, and HDFS 2.x, we dropped packages related to the following software:   VOMS Admin Server \u2212  Retirement Policy  BeStMan \u2212 replaced by  Load Balanced GridFTP  GLExec \u2212 replaced by  Singularty  Globus GRAM \u2212 available from EPEL  GIP and OSG Info Services \u2212 BDII servers retired   The aforementioned packages are still be available in OSG 3.3 and will receive regular support until December 2017 and security updates until June 2018 per our  release policy . See  this section  for the complete list of packages removed from OSG 3.4.   OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.   StashCache is supported on EL7 only.   xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.",

This option must be used when the disambiguation code does not correctly determine which PBS is in use.\n\n\nRelaxed proxy validation in jGlobus to be RFC-3820 compliant in order for proxies to work properly with BeStMan\n\n\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\n StashCache is supported on EL7 only. \n xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-1 on EL6.\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details.\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the September release.\n\n\nUpdates to VOMS admin server require the updated emi-trustmanager-tomcat and re-running the configure script:\\ \nroot@host # /var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/configure.sh\n\n\nVOMS admin server shows an error when modifying/adding/signing AUPs, but all the actions still work.\n\n\nAfter updating OSG-CE to version 3.3-12, please disable and remove OSG Info Services via the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\nroot@host #\n service osg-info-services stop\n\nroot@host #\n yum erase gip osg-info-services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: `pkgurl\nhttp://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages` has been replaced by `topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu` and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds `pkgurl`. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build \n 1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.\n\n\nA previous version (\n1.17.0-2.5\n) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison \n1.17.0-2.6\n and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in \ncondor_config.local\n or a new file in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n directory. Delete these lines and run \ncondor_reconfig\n.\n\n\n\n\n# GlideinWMS Gratia commands\n\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n \n=\n /var/lib/gratia/data\n\nJOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n=\n$$\n([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\\nLocal Job\\\n, TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details.\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the August release.\n\n\nUpdates to VOMS admin server require the updated emi-trustmanager-tomcat and re-running the configure script:\\ \nroot@host # /var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/configure.sh\n\n\nVOMS admin server shows an error when modifying/adding/signing AUPs, but all the actions still work.\n\n\nAfter updating OSG-CE to version 3.3-12, please disable and remove OSG Info Services via the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\nroot@host #\n service osg-info-services stop\n\nroot@host #\n yum erase gip osg-info-services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: `pkgurl\nhttp://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages` has been replaced by `topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu` and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds `pkgurl`. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build \n 1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.\n\n\nA previous version (\n1.17.0-2.5\n) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison \n1.17.0-2.6\n and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in \ncondor_config.local\n or a new file in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n directory. Delete these lines and run \ncondor_reconfig\n.\n\n\n\n\n# GlideinWMS Gratia commands\n\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n \n=\n /var/lib/gratia/data\n\nJOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n=\n$$\n([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\\nLocal Job\\\n, TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

This warning can safely be ignored.  Using the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test ( SOFTWARE-2763 ). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the August release.  Updates to VOMS admin server require the updated emi-trustmanager-tomcat and re-running the configure script:\\  root@host # /var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/configure.sh  VOMS admin server shows an error when modifying/adding/signing AUPs, but all the actions still work.  After updating OSG-CE to version 3.3-12, please disable and remove OSG Info Services via the following procedure:   root@host #  service osg-info-services stop root@host #  yum erase gip osg-info-services   The Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: `pkgurl http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages` has been replaced by `topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu` and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds `pkgurl`. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build   1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.  A previous version ( 1.17.0-2.5 ) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison  1.17.0-2.6  and later of the probes.

            "text": "OSG Software Release 3.3.25\n\n\nRelease Date\n: 2017-06-14\n\n\nSummary of changes\n\n\nThis release contains:\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.3.25\n\n\nMake the LCMAPS VOMS plugin consider only the first FQAN to be consistent with GUMS\n\n\nUpdate to \nXRootD 4.6.1\n\n\nUpdate to xrootd-lcmaps 1.3.3 for EL7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate StashCache meta-packages to require XRootD 4.6.1\n\n\nUpdate to \nGlideinWMS 3.2.19\n\n\nHTCondor-CE: Add WholeNodeWanted ClassAd expression so jobs can request a whole node from the batch system\n\n\nAdd vo-client-lcmaps-voms dependency to osg-gridftp and osg-ce\n\n\nUpdated to voms-admin-server 2.7.0-1.22 (security update)\n\n\nFix osg-update-vos script to clean yum cache in order pick up the latest vo-client RPM\n\n\nosg-configure 1.8.1\n\n\nreject empty \nallowed_vos\n in subclusters\n\n\nget default \nallowed_vos\n from LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n\n\nissue warning (rather than error out) if OSG_APP or OSG_DATA directories are not present\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts now refers to repo.grid.iu.edu (rather than the retired software.grid.iu.edu)\n\n\nNo patch to globus-xio, drop the unneeded one\n\n\nosg-build 1.10.0\n\n\ndrop vdt-build alias\n\n\ndrop ~/.osg-build.ini configuration file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\n StashCache is supported on EL7 only. \n xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-1 on EL6.\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nUpdates to VOMS admin server require the updated emi-trustmanager-tomcat and re-running the configure script:\\ \nroot@host # /var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/configure.sh\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the July release.\n\n\nVOMS admin server shows an error when modifying/adding/signing AUPs, but all the actions still work.\n\n\nAfter updating OSG-CE to version 3.3-12, please disable and remove OSG Info Services via the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\nroot@host #\n service osg-info-services stop\n\nroot@host #\n yum erase gip osg-info-services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: `pkgurl\nhttp://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages` has been replaced by `topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu` and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds `pkgurl`. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build \n 1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.\n\n\nA previous version (\n1.17.0-2.5\n) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison \n1.17.0-2.6\n and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in \ncondor_config.local\n or a new file in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n directory. Delete these lines and run \ncondor_reconfig\n.\n\n\n\n\n# GlideinWMS Gratia commands\n\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n \n=\n /var/lib/gratia/data\n\nJOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n=\n$$\n([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\\nLocal Job\\\n, TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the July release.  VOMS admin server shows an error when modifying/adding/signing AUPs, but all the actions still work.  After updating OSG-CE to version 3.3-12, please disable and remove OSG Info Services via the following procedure:   root@host #  service osg-info-services stop root@host #  yum erase gip osg-info-services   The Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: `pkgurl http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages` has been replaced by `topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu` and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds `pkgurl`. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build   1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.  A previous version ( 1.17.0-2.5 ) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison  1.17.0-2.6  and later of the probes.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nAfter updating OSG-CE to version 3.3-12, please disable and remove OSG Info Services via the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\nroot@host #\n service osg-info-services stop\n\nroot@host #\n yum erase gip osg-info-services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: `pkgurl\nhttp://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages` has been replaced by `topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu` and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds `pkgurl`. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build \n 1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.\n\n\nA previous version (\n1.17.0-2.5\n) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison \n1.17.0-2.6\n and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in \ncondor_config.local\n or a new file in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n directory. Delete these lines and run \ncondor_reconfig\n.\n\n\n\n\n# GlideinWMS Gratia commands\n\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n \n=\n /var/lib/gratia/data\n\nJOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n=\n$$\n([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\\nLocal Job\\\n, TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created.

To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build   1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.  A previous version ( 1.17.0-2.5 ) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly.

            "text": "OSG Software Release 3.3.23\n\n\nRelease Date\n: 2017-04-11\n\n\nSummary of changes\n\n\nThis release contains:\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.3.23\n\n\nLCMAPS VOMS plugin: Use VOMS attributes to map users\n\n\nHTCondor-CE 2.1.5\n: LCMAPS VOMS integration, package Slurm configuration\n\n\nCVMFS 2.3.5\n: Fixes, including automount fix when autofs restarts on EL7\n\n\nPegasus 4.7.4\n: \nUpdate from version 4.6.1\n\n\nOSG-CE 3.3-12: Removed gip and osg-info-services, see note below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming repository\n\n\nLCMAPS 1.6.6-1.3: Enable VOMS attribute checking by default\n\n\nFrontier squid 3.5.24-3.1\n: Fix for some crashes under heavy load\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\n After updating OSG-CE to version 3.3-12, please disable and remove OSG Info Services via the following procedure:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service osg-info-services stop\n\nroot@host #\n yum erase gip osg-info-services\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nThe Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: `pkgurl\nhttp://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages` has been replaced by `topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu` and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds `pkgurl`. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build \n 1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.\n\n\nA previous version (\n1.17.0-2.5\n) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison \n1.17.0-2.6\n and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in \ncondor_config.local\n or a new file in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n directory. Delete these lines and run \ncondor_reconfig\n.\n\n\n\n\n# GlideinWMS Gratia commands\n\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n \n=\n /var/lib/gratia/data\n\nJOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n=\n$$\n([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\\nLocal Job\\\n, TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository. Note that in some cases, there are multiple RPMs for each package. You can click on any given package to see the set of RPMs or see the complete list below.\n\n\nEnterprise Linux

To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build   1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.  A previous version ( 1.17.0-2.5 ) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison  1.17.0-2.6  and later of the probes.

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\n On Friday, March 17th, \nXRootD 4.6.0\n was pulled from the release repository. \n Most of the issues origin from improper CRL verification bug introduced in the recent code. Criticality of the issue:\n\n\nhigh criticality running XRootD in a \nserver\n mode you may have issues since reading the final file usually does require authentication (mostly GSI auth which relates to CRL verification code)\n\n\nlow criticality running XRootD in a \nmanager\n mode you may NOT experience any issues assuming your redirector does not require authentication\n\n\nto check if you have the affected components installed, run \nroot@host # rpm -qa | grep xrootd\n to display the versions of your xrootd packages. If any of them are version 4.6.0, run \nroot@host # yum downgrade \n on those packages.\n\n\nas pre-caution to avoid this bug \nXRootD 4.6.0\n was pulled from the release repository and we do not recommend using it until further notice\n\n\ngiven the number of recent improvements and fixes 4.6.1 is available in EPEL testing repo and once it gets to production release we push it into OSG release as well\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: `pkgurl\nhttp://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages` has been replaced by `topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu` and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds `pkgurl`. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build \n 1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.\n\n\nA previous version (\n1.17.0-2.5\n) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison \n1.17.0-2.6\n and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in \ncondor_config.local\n or a new file in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n directory. Delete these lines and run \ncondor_reconfig\n.\n\n\n\n\n# GlideinWMS Gratia commands\n\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n \n=\n /var/lib/gratia/data\n\nJOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n=\n$$\n([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\\nLocal Job\\\n, TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created.

            "text": "On Friday, March 17th,  XRootD 4.6.0  was pulled from the release repository.   Most of the issues origin from improper CRL verification bug introduced in the recent code. Criticality of the issue:  high criticality running XRootD in a  server  mode you may have issues since reading the final file usually does require authentication (mostly GSI auth which relates to CRL verification code)  low criticality running XRootD in a  manager  mode you may NOT experience any issues assuming your redirector does not require authentication  to check if you have the affected components installed, run  root@host # rpm -qa | grep xrootd  to display the versions of your xrootd packages. If any of them are version 4.6.0, run  root@host # yum downgrade   on those packages.  as pre-caution to avoid this bug  XRootD 4.6.0  was pulled from the release repository and we do not recommend using it until further notice  given the number of recent improvements and fixes 4.6.1 is available in EPEL testing repo and once it gets to production release we push it into OSG release as well    The Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: `pkgurl http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages` has been replaced by `topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu` and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds `pkgurl`. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build   1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.  A previous version ( 1.17.0-2.5 ) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison  1.17.0-2.6  and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in  condor_config.local  or a new file in  /etc/condor/config.d  directory. Delete these lines and run  condor_reconfig .   # GlideinWMS Gratia commands  PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR   =  /var/lib/gratia/data JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName = $$ ([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\ Local Job\\ , TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])  SUBMIT_EXPRS   =   $( SUBMIT_EXPRS )  JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName      On EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nThe glideinWMS 3.2.17 factory has a bug when you attempt to restart the service. You must first remove a lock file (\n/var/lib/gwms-factory/work-dir/lock/glideinWMS.lock\n) that isn't properly cleaned up when the service is stopped.\n\n\nThe Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: `pkgurl\nhttp://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages` has been replaced by `topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu` and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds `pkgurl`. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build \n 1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.\n\n\nA previous version (\n1.17.0-2.5\n) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison \n1.17.0-2.6\n and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in \ncondor_config.local\n or a new file in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n directory. Delete these lines and run \ncondor_reconfig\n.\n\n\n\n\n# GlideinWMS Gratia commands\n\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n \n=\n /var/lib/gratia/data\n\nJOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n=\n$$\n([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\\nLocal Job\\\n, TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension.

Utilizing MS_NODEV as a container image mount option mitigates this potential vector of attack. As a result, this update should be implemented with high urgency.

You must first remove a lock file ( /var/lib/gwms-factory/work-dir/lock/glideinWMS.lock ) that isn't properly cleaned up when the service is stopped.  The Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: `pkgurl http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages` has been replaced by `topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu` and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds `pkgurl`. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build   1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.  A previous version ( 1.17.0-2.5 ) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison  1.17.0-2.6  and later of the probes.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nWhen updating or installing HTCondor on an EL 7 system with SELinux enabled, make sure that policycoreutils-python is installed before HTCondor. This dependency will be properly declared in the HTCondor RPM in the next release.\n\n\nA previous version (\n1.17.0-2.5\n) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison (\n1.17.0-2.6\n) and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in \ncondor_config.local\n or a new file in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n directory. Delete these lines and run \ncondor_reconfig\n.\n\n\n\n\n# GlideinWMS Gratia commands\n\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n \n=\n /var/lib/gratia/data\n\nJOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n=\n$$\n([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\\nLocal Job\\\n, TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nThe previous version (\n1.17.0-2.5\n) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use this version (\n1.17.0-2.6\n) of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in \ncondor_config.local\n or a new file in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n directory. Delete these lines and run \ncondor_reconfig\n.\n\n\n\n\n# GlideinWMS Gratia commands\n\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n \n=\n /var/lib/gratia/data\n\nJOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName\n=\n$$\n([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \\\nLocal Job\\\n, TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension). Watch especially for  /etc/lcmaps.db , which every site is expected to edit.",

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nOn EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n does not show any jobs when run as root with \ncondor-8.5.5\n from upcoming. Work around this by using \ncondor_ce_q -allusers\n instead.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository. Note that in some cases, there are multiple RPMs for each package. You can click on any given package to see the set of RPMs or see the complete list below.\n\n\nEnterprise Linux

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration file for GlideinWMS depends on a bug that was fixed in HTCondor version 8.4.7 (and 8.5.5 in upcoming). Unfortunately, this incompatibility was not discovered before HTCondor was released. This affects all GlideinWMS submit hosts running HTCondor 8.4.7 or 8.5.5. It does not affect the factory, it will affect the fronted only if it is used also to submit jobs. In the configuration file \n/etc/condor/config.d/02_gwms_schedds.config\n, the following lines:\\\n\n\n\n\nJobAdInformationAttrs\n \n=\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n \n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n JobAdInformationAttrs\n\n\n\n\n\n\\ Should be replaced by:\\\n\n\nif version \n= 8.4.6\n\n    \nJobAdInformationAttrs\n \n=\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n \n    \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n JobAdInformationAttrs\n\nelif\n \nversion\n \n=\n \n8.5.0\n\n\n    if version \n= 8.5.4\n\n        \nJobAdInformationAttrs\n \n=\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n \n        \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n JobAdInformationAttrs\n    \nelif\n \nversion\n \n==\n \n8\n.5.5\n        \nJobAdInformationAttrs\n \n=\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n \n        \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n +JobAdInformationAttrs\n\n    else\n\n        \nJobAdInformationAttrs\n \n=\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n \n        \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n JobAdInformationAttrs\n\n    endif\n\n\nelif\n \nversion\n \n==\n \n8\n.4.7\n    \nJobAdInformationAttrs\n \n=\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n \n    \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n +JobAdInformationAttrs\n\nelse\n\n    \nJobAdInformationAttrs\n \n=\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n \n    \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n \n=\n \n$(\nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS\n)\n \n$(\nJOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS\n)\n JobAdInformationAttrs\n\nendif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n does not show any jobs when run as root with \ncondor-8.5.5\n from upcoming. Work around this by using \ncondor_ce_q -allusers\n instead.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

With the HTCondor-CE-Bosco, an organization can setup a CE with only SSH access to the cluster, rather than the long list of requirements for a regular HTCondor-CE.\n\n\nHTCondor-CE-Bosco talk at OSG All Hands Meeting 2016\n\n\nAuthor\u2019s Blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor 8.4.6\n: Fixes serious regression in HTCondor 8.4.5\n\n\nCVMFS 2.2.2\n\n\nThe update to CVMFS 2.2.1 includes a major overhaul to the default OSG configuration. Sites who have performed extensive changes to the default configuration are advised to verify their configurations before deploying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG CE packages will no longer install GRAM components\n\n\nBeStMan on EL7 platforms\n\n\nHTCondor-CE 2.0.5\n: HTCondor-CE-CEView bug fixes, support HTCondor-CE-BOSCO\n\n\nBLAHP 1.18.19: Fix memory request for PBS, updated SLURM support\n\n\nPegasus 4.6.1\n: Updated from version 4.3.1\n\n\nosg-pki-tools 1.2.17:\n\n\nFix timeout handling, improved error messages\n\n\nAnother bug fix\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-configure 1.4.0\n\n\nAdded support for configuring HTCondor-CE-Bosco\n\n\nFixed bug in RSV configuration where HTCondor-CE probes are sometimes not enabled\n\n\nAdd the \"slurm_cluster\" configuration option to the 20-slurm.ini configuraton file\n\n\nAdded updating the LCMAPS configuration when changing the security mechanism in 10-misc.ini\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor 8.5.4\n in the Upcoming repository\n\n\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n does not show any jobs when run as root with \ncondor-8.5.4\n from upcoming. Work around this by using \ncondor_ce_q -allusers\n instead.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n does not show any jobs when run as root with \ncondor-8.5.3\n from upcoming. Work around this by using \ncondor_ce_q -allusers\n instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new HTCondor-CE View has a bug where some graphs show up blank. This may also manifest in errors like the following in \n/var/log/condor-ce/GangliadLog\n: \\ \n\n\n\n\n1/11/16 15:05:54 Failed to execute /usr/share/condor-ce/condor_ce_metric --conf /etc/ganglia/gmond.conf --group HTCondor.Schedd --name SchedulerRecentDaemonCoreDutyCycle --value 1.04449 --type float --units % --slope both --spoof 192.170.227.226:itbv-ce-htcondor.mwt2.org --tmax 120 --dmax 86400: Usage: condor_ce_metric [options]\n\n\ncondor_ce_metric: error: no such option: --conf\n\n\n01/11/16 15:05:54 Failed to publish metric SchedulerRecentDaemonCoreDutyCycle for itbv-ce-htcondor.mwt2.org \n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository. Note that in some cases, there are multiple RPMs for each package.

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n does not show any jobs when run as root with \ncondor-8.5.2\n from upcoming. Work around this by using \ncondor_ce_q -allusers\n instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new HTCondor-CE View has a bug where some graphs show up blank. This may also manifest in errors like the following in \n/var/log/condor-ce/GangliadLog\n: \\ \n\n\n\n\n1/11/16 15:05:54 Failed to execute /usr/share/condor-ce/condor_ce_metric --conf /etc/ganglia/gmond.conf --group HTCondor.Schedd --name SchedulerRecentDaemonCoreDutyCycle --value 1.04449 --type float --units % --slope both --spoof 192.170.227.226:itbv-ce-htcondor.mwt2.org --tmax 120 --dmax 86400: Usage: condor_ce_metric [options]\n\n\ncondor_ce_metric: error: no such option: --conf\n\n\n01/11/16 15:05:54 Failed to publish metric SchedulerRecentDaemonCoreDutyCycle for itbv-ce-htcondor.mwt2.org \n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nThe new HTCondor-CE View has a bug where some graphs show up blank. This may also manifest in errors like the following in \n/var/log/condor-ce/GangliadLog\n: \\ \n\n\n\n\n1/11/16 15:05:54 Failed to execute /usr/share/condor-ce/condor_ce_metric --conf /etc/ganglia/gmond.conf --group HTCondor.Schedd --name SchedulerRecentDaemonCoreDutyCycle --value 1.04449 --type float --units % --slope both --spoof 192.170.227.226:itbv-ce-htcondor.mwt2.org --tmax 120 --dmax 86400: Usage: condor_ce_metric [options]\n\n\ncondor_ce_metric: error: no such option: --conf\n\n\n01/11/16 15:05:54 Failed to publish metric SchedulerRecentDaemonCoreDutyCycle for itbv-ce-htcondor.mwt2.org \n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor 8.4.0 has changed it's behavior in ways that cause the GlideinWMS frontend configuration to break. In order to correct this, the following setting needs to be added to the configuration file:\n\n\nCOLLECTOR_USES_SHARED_PORT = False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new HTCondor-CE View has a bug where some graphs show up blank. This may also manifest in errors like the following in \n/var/log/condor-ce/GangliadLog\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/11/16 15:05:54 Failed to execute /usr/share/condor-ce/condor_ce_metric --conf /etc/ganglia/gmond.conf --group HTCondor.Schedd --name SchedulerRecentDaemonCoreDutyCycle --value 1.04449 --type float --units % --slope both --spoof 192.170.227.226:itbv-ce-htcondor.mwt2.org --tmax 120 --dmax 86400: Usage: condor_ce_metric [options]\n\n\ncondor_ce_metric: error: no such option: --conf\n\n\n01/11/16 15:05:54 Failed to publish metric SchedulerRecentDaemonCoreDutyCycle for itbv-ce-htcondor.mwt2.org \n\n\n\n\nSince version 1.14, HTCondor-CE has required condor \n= 8.3.7 but this was not reflected in the packaging. If your routed jobs do not have the proper environment set, your version of HTCondor-CE is newer than 1.14, and your version of condor is older than 8.3.7, consider upgrading your version of condor. This will be fixed in the next release.\n\n\n\n\nStashCache packages need to be manually configured\n\n\n\n\nManual configuration for origin server\n\n\nAssuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use:\nxrd.port 1094\nall.role server\nall.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213\nall.export / nostage\nxrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect\nofs.trace none\nxrd.trace conn\ncms.trace all\nsec.protocol  host\nsec.protbind  * none\nall.adminpath /var/run/xrootd\nall.pidpath /var/run/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual configuration for cache server\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare \npss.origin \nstash-redirector.example.com\n instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

            "text": "HTCondor 8.4.0 has changed it's behavior in ways that cause the GlideinWMS frontend configuration to break. In order to correct this, the following setting needs to be added to the configuration file:  COLLECTOR_USES_SHARED_PORT = False    The new HTCondor-CE View has a bug where some graphs show up blank. This may also manifest in errors like the following in  /var/log/condor-ce/GangliadLog :     1/11/16 15:05:54 Failed to execute /usr/share/condor-ce/condor_ce_metric --conf /etc/ganglia/gmond.conf --group HTCondor.Schedd --name SchedulerRecentDaemonCoreDutyCycle --value 1.04449 --type float --units % --slope both --spoof 192.170.227.226:itbv-ce-htcondor.mwt2.org --tmax 120 --dmax 86400: Usage: condor_ce_metric [options]  condor_ce_metric: error: no such option: --conf  01/11/16 15:05:54 Failed to publish metric SchedulerRecentDaemonCoreDutyCycle for itbv-ce-htcondor.mwt2.org    Since version 1.14, HTCondor-CE has required condor  = 8.3.7 but this was not reflected in the packaging. If your routed jobs do not have the proper environment set, your version of HTCondor-CE is newer than 1.14, and your version of condor is older than 8.3.7, consider upgrading your version of condor. This will be fixed in the next release.   StashCache packages need to be manually configured   Manual configuration for origin server  Assuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use: xrd.port 1094\nall.role server\nall.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213\nall.export / nostage\nxrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect\nofs.trace none\nxrd.trace conn\ncms.trace all\nsec.protocol  host\nsec.protbind  * none\nall.adminpath /var/run/xrootd\nall.pidpath /var/run/xrootd        Manual configuration for cache server   In contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare  pss.origin  stash-redirector.example.com  instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is  here .     In both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:  CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo    to  CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo",

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

In order to correct this, the following setting needs to be added to the configuration file:  COLLECTOR_USES_SHARED_PORT = False    StashCache packages need to be manually configured   Manual configuration for origin server  Assuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use: xrd.port 1094\nall.role server\nall.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213\nall.export / nostage\nxrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect\nofs.trace none\nxrd.trace conn\ncms.trace all\nsec.protocol  host\nsec.protbind  * none\nall.adminpath /var/run/xrootd\nall.pidpath /var/run/xrootd        Manual configuration for cache server   In contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare  pss.origin  stash-redirector.example.com  instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is  here .    In both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from: CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo      to      :::file\n    CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo",

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nCILogon CA certificate files have been reorganized between our various CA certificate packages.\n\nTo avoid file conflicts, you should upgrade your CA certificate RPMs at the same time, such as via the following command:\n\n\nroot@host # yum update '*-ca-cert*'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor 8.4.0 has changed it's behavior in ways that cause the GlideinWMS frontend configuration to break. In order to correct this, the following setting needs to be added to the configuration file:\n\n\nCOLLECTOR_USES_SHARED_PORT = False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStashCache packages need to be manually configured\n\n\n\n\nManual configuration for origin server\n\n\nAssuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use:\nxrd.port 1094\nall.role server\nall.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213\nall.export / nostage\nxrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect\nofs.trace none\nxrd.trace conn\ncms.trace all\nsec.protocol  host\nsec.protbind  * none\nall.adminpath /var/run/xrootd\nall.pidpath /var/run/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual configuration for cache server\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare \npss.origin \nstash-redirector.example.com\n instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

For hosts with only the main CA certificate bundle, there is no change.\n\n\nThis release contains:\n\n\n\n\nUpdated CVMFS configuration to support approved repositories from any domain\n\n\nFixed osg-ca-certs-updater to work when no \"compat\" packages are present\n\n\nAdded a new LCMAPS plug-in for process tracking\n\n\nAdded a new RSV PerfSONAR probe\n\n\nAdded a new RSV probe to check StashCache cache collector ads at the GOC\n\n\nEL 7: Fixed Frontier Squid to start up properly after a reboot\n\n\nEL 7: Fixed the MyProxy service to start up properly\n\n\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nCILogon CA certificate files have been reorganized between our various CA certificate packages.\n\nTo avoid file conflicts, you should upgrade your CA certificate RPMs at the same time, such as via the following command:\n\n\nroot@host # yum update '*-ca-cert*'\n\n\n\n\nWhen using osg-configure to configure a CE host, it will fail because it tries to contact a ReSS server that has been shut down permanently. The ReSS service has been deprecated since early 2014, and support for it will be removed from osg-configure in an upcoming version. To work around this osg-configure failure now, edit /etc/osg/config.d/30-infoservices.ini and set the option:\n\n\nress_servers = https://localhost[RAW]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a known memory leak in lcmaps-plugins-scas-client that HTCondor-CE triggers repeatedly. A special OSG release, coming soon, will fix the underlying memory leak, but in the meantime it is possible to make two small configuration changes to slow the rate at which memory leaks.\n\n\n\n\nIn /etc/condor-ce/config.d/01-ce-auth.conf, make sure the following attribute is defined as follows (note the $(USERS) at the end):\nCOLLECTOR.ALLOW_ADVERTISE_STARTD\n \n=\n  \n$(\nUNMAPPED_USERS\n)\n, \n$(\nUSERS\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso in /etc/condor-ce/config.d/01-ce-auth.conf, add the following line to the end of the file:\n\n\n:::\n \nfile\n\n\nGSS_ASSIST_GRIDMAP_CACHE_EXPIRATION\n \n=\n \n30\n*\n$(\nMINUTE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the attributes are set properly by running the following command:\n\n\n::: file\n$ condor_ce_config_val COLLECTOR.ALLOW_ADVERTISE_STARTD GSS_ASSIST_GRIDMAP_CACHE_EXPIRATION\n*@unmapped.opensciencegrid.org, *@users.opensciencegrid.org\n30*60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor 8.4.0 has changed it's behavior in ways that cause the GlideinWMS frontend configuration to break. In order to correct this, the following setting needs to be added to the configuration file:\n\n\nCOLLECTOR_USES_SHARED_PORT = False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStashCache packages need to be manually configured\n\n\n\n\nManual configuration for origin server\n\n\nAssuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use:\nxrd.port 1094\nall.role server\nall.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213\nall.export / nostage\nxrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect\nofs.trace none\nxrd.trace conn\ncms.trace all\nsec.protocol  host\nsec.protbind  * none\nall.adminpath /var/run/xrootd\nall.pidpath /var/run/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual configuration for cache server\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare \npss.origin \nstash-redirector.example.com\n instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository. Note that in some cases, there are multiple RPMs for each package.

In /etc/condor-ce/config.d/01-ce-auth.conf, make sure the following attribute is defined as follows (note the $(USERS) at the end): COLLECTOR.ALLOW_ADVERTISE_STARTD   =    $( UNMAPPED_USERS ) ,  $( USERS )       Also in /etc/condor-ce/config.d/01-ce-auth.conf, add the following line to the end of the file:  :::   file  GSS_ASSIST_GRIDMAP_CACHE_EXPIRATION   =   30 * $( MINUTE )     Verify that the attributes are set properly by running the following command:  ::: file\n$ condor_ce_config_val COLLECTOR.ALLOW_ADVERTISE_STARTD GSS_ASSIST_GRIDMAP_CACHE_EXPIRATION\n*@unmapped.opensciencegrid.org, *@users.opensciencegrid.org\n30*60    HTCondor 8.4.0 has changed it's behavior in ways that cause the GlideinWMS frontend configuration to break. In order to correct this, the following setting needs to be added to the configuration file:  COLLECTOR_USES_SHARED_PORT = False    StashCache packages need to be manually configured   Manual configuration for origin server  Assuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use: xrd.port 1094\nall.role server\nall.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213\nall.export / nostage\nxrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect\nofs.trace none\nxrd.trace conn\ncms.trace all\nsec.protocol  host\nsec.protbind  * none\nall.adminpath /var/run/xrootd\nall.pidpath /var/run/xrootd        Manual configuration for cache server   In contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare  pss.origin  stash-redirector.example.com  instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is  here .     In both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:  CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo    to  CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo",

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nCA Certificate Update Information\n\n\nWhat Is Changing\n\n\nA new IGTF Certificate Bundle (v1.69) has just been released. This release has a very important change and we would like our sites to install it as soon as they can.\n\n\nWho Is Impacted By This Change:\n\n\nAll OSG sites and users need to install the new CA bundle. Especially US-Atlas and US-CMS sites should install the bundle as soon as possible since their VOs will go under the transition in November/December timeframe.\n\n\nWhy This Change Is Happening:\n\n\nThe OSG CA is changing its backend service support from Digicert to CILogon HSM. As a result, a new OSG CA is created and just recently been accredited by IGTF. The official name of the new OSG CA in the IGTF bundle is CILogon OSG CA. Starting in November we will transition our VOs to start using the new OSG CA (CMS and Atlas being first ones). If a site has not installed the CA bundle by then, they will have authentication failures.\n\n\nWhat You Should Do:\n\n\nInstall the new CA bundle as soon as possible. The latest CA bundle will NOT be distributed in OSG Software v 3.1 because OSG no longer supports it.\n\n\nFor Linux servers (including worker nodes), ensure that the certificate bundle RPM is at version osg-ca-certs-1.50-1 or igtf-ca-certs-1.69-1 or greater.\n\n\nInstructions for installing server CA certificate bundles are at \nhttps://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallCertAuth\n\n\nWe also highly recommend that you use the CA Cert automatic updater \nhttps://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/OsgCaCertsUpdater\n but note that you need to be using a current OSG software distribution for that to work, that is, OSG 3.2 or 3.3.\n\n\nOther Information:\n\n\nIf you have the CA certificate bundle installed on a server with OSG 3.1, you need to upgrade to OSG 3.2 or greater. Follow these instructions: \nhttps://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/OSGReleaseSeries#Updating_from_OSG_3_1_or_3_2_to\n\n\nPlease email OSG Security Team with questions or comments\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor 8.4.0 has changed it's behavior in ways that cause the GlideinWMS frontend configuration to break. In order to correct this, the following setting needs to be added to the configuration file:\n\n\nCOLLECTOR_USES_SHARED_PORT = False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStashCache packages need to be manually configured\n\n\n\n\nManual configuration for origin server\n\n\nAssuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use:\nxrd.port 1094\nall.role server\nall.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213\nall.export / nostage\nxrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect\nofs.trace none\nxrd.trace conn\ncms.trace all\nsec.protocol  host\nsec.protbind  * none\nall.adminpath /var/run/xrootd\nall.pidpath /var/run/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual configuration for cache server\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare \npss.origin \nstash-redirector.example.com\n instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is  here .     In both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:  CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo    to  CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo",

In order to correct this, the following setting needs to be added to the configuration file:  COLLECTOR_USES_SHARED_PORT = False    StashCache packages need to be manually configured   Manual configuration for origin server  Assuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use: xrd.port 1094\nall.role server\nall.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213\nall.export / nostage\nxrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect\nofs.trace none\nxrd.trace conn\ncms.trace all\nsec.protocol  host\nsec.protbind  * none\nall.adminpath /var/run/xrootd\nall.pidpath /var/run/xrootd        Manual configuration for cache server   In contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare  pss.origin  stash-redirector.example.com  instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is  here .     In both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:  CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo    to  CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo",

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.

The risk of this vulnerability has been assessed by OSG Security Team as \u201cCritical\u201d. A new GUMS version 1.5.0 has been released and it is included in OSG Software version 3.2.27/3.3.1. Site administrators should update ASAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor 8.3.8\n\n\nHTCondor CE 1.15\n\n\nAdd 'default_remote_cerequirements' attribute to the JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n\n\nVerify the first route in JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES in the init script\n\n\nhtcondor-ce-collecotr now uses /etc/sysconfig/condor-ce-collector for additional configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngridFTP-HDFS checksum verification improvements\n\n\nChecksum algorithm names are checked with a case insensitive comparison\n\n\nError codes are properly returned to the user\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCA certificates based on \nIGTF 1.67\n\n\nStashCache improvements\n\n\nAdded logging to the StashCache daemon\n\n\nAdvertise the StashCache daemon version to the master ClassAd\n\n\nImproved example configuration files to include \"pss.trace all\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HTCondor shared port daemon can run out of file descriptors.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a problem with HTCondor 8.3.7 and 8.3.8.\n\n\nThe problem will be fixed in the HTCondor 8.4.0 release.\n\n\nThe glideInWMS factories (and possibly front-ends) using the following configuration model will cause the HTCondor shared port daemon to leak file descriptors. The relevant configuration fragment is similar to:\nUSE_SHARED_PORT\n \n=\n FALSE\n\nDAEMON_LIST\n \n=\n \n$(\nDAEMON_LIST\n)\n SHARED_PORT\n\nSCHEDD.USE_SHARED_PORT\n \n=\n TRUE\n\nSHADOW.USE_SHADED_PORT\n \n=\n TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis non-standard shared-port configuration is probably used to avoid dealing with shared-port collector trees.\n\n\n\n\nThe work-around is to start the HTCondor master with CONDOR_PRIVATE_SHARED_PORT_COOKIE set in the environment, as it will propagate down to the target daemons. CONDOR_PRIVATE_SHARED_PORT_COOKIE should contain a 32-byte random number in hexadecimal format (64 characters). \nNote:\n care must be taken to ensure that this value is private. Upgrade to HTCondor 8.4.0 as soon as possible and stop using this workaround. * Running osg-configure with the new version of HTCondor installed causes a deprecation warning to be emitted. The warning does not affect the services. * StashCache packages need to be manually configured\n\n\n\n\nManual configuration for origin server\n\n\n\n\nAssuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use:\nxrd.port 1094\nall.role server\nall.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213\nall.export / nostage\nxrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect\nofs.trace none\nxrd.trace conn\ncms.trace all\nsec.protocol  host\nsec.protbind  * none\nall.adminpath /var/run/xrootd\nall.pidpath /var/run/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual configuration for cache server\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare \npss.origin \nstash-redirector.example.com\n instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

            "text": "The HTCondor shared port daemon can run out of file descriptors.   This is a problem with HTCondor 8.3.7 and 8.3.8.  The problem will be fixed in the HTCondor 8.4.0 release.  The glideInWMS factories (and possibly front-ends) using the following configuration model will cause the HTCondor shared port daemon to leak file descriptors. The relevant configuration fragment is similar to: USE_SHARED_PORT   =  FALSE DAEMON_LIST   =   $( DAEMON_LIST )  SHARED_PORT SCHEDD.USE_SHARED_PORT   =  TRUE SHADOW.USE_SHADED_PORT   =  TRUE      This non-standard shared-port configuration is probably used to avoid dealing with shared-port collector trees.   The work-around is to start the HTCondor master with CONDOR_PRIVATE_SHARED_PORT_COOKIE set in the environment, as it will propagate down to the target daemons. CONDOR_PRIVATE_SHARED_PORT_COOKIE should contain a 32-byte random number in hexadecimal format (64 characters).  Note:  care must be taken to ensure that this value is private. Upgrade to HTCondor 8.4.0 as soon as possible and stop using this workaround. * Running osg-configure with the new version of HTCondor installed causes a deprecation warning to be emitted. The warning does not affect the services. * StashCache packages need to be manually configured   Manual configuration for origin server   Assuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use: xrd.port 1094\nall.role server\nall.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213\nall.export / nostage\nxrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect\nofs.trace none\nxrd.trace conn\ncms.trace all\nsec.protocol  host\nsec.protbind  * none\nall.adminpath /var/run/xrootd\nall.pidpath /var/run/xrootd      Manual configuration for cache server   In contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare  pss.origin  stash-redirector.example.com  instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is  here .     In both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:  CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo    to  CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo",

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.

All of the documentation can be found in the \nRelease3\n area of the TWiki.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor CE does not work with HTCondor 8.3.6 (in upcoming) on EL 5 platforms. So, we are holding HTCondor at version 8.3.4 (in upcoming) for EL 5 platforms.\n\n\n\n\nStashCache packages need to be manually configured\n\n\n\n\nManual configuration for origin server\n\n\nAssuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use:\nxrd.port 1094\nall.role server\nall.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213\nall.export / nostage\nxrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect\nofs.trace none\nxrd.trace conn\ncms.trace all\nsec.protocol  host\nsec.protbind  * none\nall.adminpath /var/run/xrootd\nall.pidpath /var/run/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual configuration for cache server\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare \npss.origin \nstash-redirector.example.com\n instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n Please be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\n Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository. Note that in some cases, there are multiple RPMs for each package.

StashCache packages need to be manually configured   Manual configuration for origin server  Assuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use: xrd.port 1094\nall.role server\nall.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213\nall.export / nostage\nxrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect\nofs.trace none\nxrd.trace conn\ncms.trace all\nsec.protocol  host\nsec.protbind  * none\nall.adminpath /var/run/xrootd\nall.pidpath /var/run/xrootd        Manual configuration for cache server   In contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare  pss.origin  stash-redirector.example.com  instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is  here .     In both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:  CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo    to  CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS= -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo",

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.
