            "text": "HTCondor-CE Overview\n\n\nThis document serves as an introduction to HTCondor-CE and how it works.\nBefore continuing with the overview, make sure that you are familiar with the following concepts:\n\n\n\n\nAn OSG site plan\n\n\nWhat is a batch system and which one will you use (\nHTCondor\n, PBS, LSF, SGE, or\n    \nSLURM\n)?\n\n\nSecurity in the OSG via \nGSI\n (i.e.,\n    \nCertificate authorities\n, user and host\n    \ncertificates\n, proxies)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPilot jobs, frontends, and factories (i.e., \nGlideinWMS\n,\n    AutoPyFactory)\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Compute Element?\n\n\nAn OSG Compute Element (CE) is the entry point for the OSG to your local resources: a layer of software that you install\non a machine that can submit jobs into your local batch system.\nAt the heart of the CE is the \njob gateway\n software, which is responsible for handling incoming jobs, authenticating\nand authorizing them, and delegating them to your batch system for execution.\n\n\nToday in the OSG, most jobs that arrive at a CE (called \ngrid jobs\n) are \nnot\n end-user jobs, but rather pilot jobs\nsubmitted from factories.\nSuccessful pilot jobs create and make available an environment for actual end-user jobs to match and ultimately run\nwithin the pilot job container.\nEventually pilot jobs remove themselves, typically after a period of inactivity.\n\n\nWhat is HTCondor-CE?\n\n\nHTCondor-CE is a special configuration of the HTCondor software designed to be a job gateway solution for the OSG.\nIt is configured to use the \nJobRouter daemon\n to\ndelegate jobs by transforming and submitting them to the site\u2019s batch system.\n\n\nBenefits of running the HTCondor-CE:\n\n\n\n\nScalability:\n HTCondor-CE is capable of supporting job workloads of large sites\n\n\nDebugging tools:\n HTCondor-CE offers \nmany tools to help troubleshoot\n\n    issues with jobs\n\n\nRouting as configuration:\n HTCondor-CE\u2019s mechanism to transform and submit jobs is customized via configuration\n    variables, which means that customizations will persist across upgrades and will not involve modification of\n    software internals to route jobs\n\n\n\n\nHow Jobs Run\n\n\nOnce an incoming grid job is authorized, it is placed into HTCondor-CE\u2019s scheduler where the JobRouter creates a\ntransformed copy (called the \nrouted job\n) and submits the copy to the batch system (called the \nbatch system job\n).\nAfter submission, HTCondor-CE monitors the batch system job and communicates its status to the original grid job, which\nin turn notifies the original submitter (e.g., job factory) of any updates.\nWhen the job completes, files are transferred along the same chain: from the batch system to the CE, then from the CE to\nthe original submitter.\n\n\nHosted CE over SSH\n\n\nThe Hosted CE is intended for small sites or as an introduction to the OSG.\nThe OSG configures and maintains an HTCondor-CE on behalf of the site.\nThe Hosted CE is a special configuration of HTCondor-CE that can submit jobs to a remote cluster over SSH.\nIt provides a simple starting point for opportunistic resource owners that want to start contributing to the OSG with\nminimal effort: an organization will be able to accept OSG jobs by allowing SSH access to a submit node in their cluster.\n\n\nIf your site intends to run over 10,000 concurrent OSG jobs, you will need to host your own\n\nHTCondor-CE\n because the Hosted CE has not yet been optimized for such\nloads.\n\n\nIf you are interested in a Hosted CE solution, please follow the instructions on \nthis page\n.\n\n\n\n\nOn HTCondor batch systems\n\n\nFor a site with an HTCondor \nbatch system\n, the JobRouter can use HTCondor protocols to place a transformed copy of\nthe grid job directly into the batch system\u2019s scheduler, meaning that the routed and batch system jobs are one and the\nsame.\nThus, there are three representations of your job, each with its own ID (see diagram below):\n\n\n\n\nSubmit host: the HTCondor job ID in the original queue\n\n\nHTCondor-CE: the incoming grid job\u2019s ID\n\n\nHTCondor batch system: the routed job\u2019s ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an HTCondor-CE/HTCondor setup, files are transferred from HTCondor-CE\u2019s spool directory to the batch system\u2019s spool\ndirectory using internal HTCondor protocols.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe JobRouter copies the job directly into the batch system and does not make use of \ncondor_submit\n.\nThis means that if the HTCondor batch system is configured to add attributes to incoming jobs when they are\nsubmitted (i.e., \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n), these attributes will not be added to the routed jobs.\n\n\n\n\nOn other batch systems\n\n\nFor non-HTCondor batch systems, the JobRouter transforms the grid job into a routed job on the CE and the routed job\nsubmits a job into the batch system via a process called the BLAHP.\nThus, there are four representations of your job, each with its own ID (see diagram below):\n\n\n\n\nSubmit host: the HTCondor job ID in the original queue\n\n\nHTCondor-CE: the incoming grid job\u2019s ID and the routed job\u2019s ID\n\n\nHTCondor batch system: the batch system\u2019s job ID\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the following figure specifies the PBS case, it applies to all non-HTCondor batch systems:\n\n\n\n\nWith non-HTCondor batch systems, HTCondor-CE cannot use internal HTCondor protocols to transfer files so its spool\ndirectory must be exported to a shared file system that is mounted on the batch system\u2019s worker nodes.\n\n\nHow the CE is Customized\n\n\nAside from the \nbasic configuration\n required in the CE\ninstallation, there are two main ways to customize your CE (if you decide any customization is required at all):\n\n\n\n\nDeciding which VOs are allowed to run at your site:\n The recommended method of authorizing VOs at your site is\n    based on the \nLCMAPS framework\n\n\nHow to filter and transform the grid jobs to be run on your batch system:\n Filtering and transforming grid jobs\n    (i.e., setting site-specific attributes or resource limits), requires configuration of your site\u2019s job routes.\n    For examples of common job routes, consult the \nJobRouter recipes\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are running HTCondor as your batch system, you will have two HTCondor configurations side-by-side (one\nresiding in \n/etc/condor/\n and the other in \n/etc/condor-ce\n) and will need to make sure to differentiate the two\nwhen editing any configuration.\n\n\n\n\nHow Security Works\n\n\nIn the OSG, security depends on a PKI infrastructure involving Certificate Authorities (CAs) where CAs sign and issue\ncertificates.\nWhen these clients and hosts wish to communicate with each other, the identities of each party is confirmed by\ncross-checking their certificates with the signing CA and establishing trust.\n\n\nIn its default configuration, HTCondor-CE uses GSI-based authentication and authorization to verify the certificate\nchain, which will work with \nLCMAPS VOMS authentication\n.\nAdditionally, it can be reconfigured to provide alternate authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos, SSL, shared\nsecret, or even IP-based authentication.\nMore information about authorization methods can be found\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nNext steps\n\n\nOnce the basic installation is done, additional activities include:\n\n\n\n\nSetting up job routes to customize incoming jobs\n\n\nSubmitting jobs to a HTCondor-CE\n \n\n\nTroubleshooting the HTCondor-CE\n\n\nRegister the CE\n\n\nRegister with the OSG GlideinWMS factories and/or the ATLAS AutoPyFactory",

coming from the OSG \u2014 it handles authorization and delegation of jobs\nto your local batch system.\nIn OSG today, most CEs accept \npilot jobs\n from a factory, which in turn are able to accept and run end-user jobs.\nSee the \nHTCondor-CE Overview\n for a much more detailed introduction.\n\n\nUse this page to learn how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot HTCondor-CE from the OSG software\nrepositories.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are installing an HTCondor-CE for use outside of the OSG, consult \nthis documentation\n\n\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points\n(consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux users \ncondor\n (UID 4716) and\n    \ngratia\n (UID 42401)\n\n\nSSL certificate:\n The HTCondor-CE service uses a host certificate at \n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n and an\n    accompanying key at \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\nDNS entries:\n Forward and reverse DNS must resolve for the HTCondor-CE host\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n The pilot factories must be able to contact your HTCondor-CE service on port 9619 (TCP)\n\n\nSubmit host:\n HTCondor-CE should be installed on a host that already has the ability to submit jobs into your\n    local cluster\n\n\nFile Systems\n: Non-HTCondor batch systems require a \nshared file system\n\n    between the HTCondor-CE host and the batch system worker nodes.\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling HTCondor-CE\n\n\nAn HTCondor-CE installation consists of the job gateway (i.e., the HTCondor-CE job router) and other support software\n(e.g., GridFTP, a Gratia probe, authentication software).\nTo simplify installation, OSG provides convenience RPMs that install all required software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will update \nall\n packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Optional)\n If your batch system is already

the CE software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install \nPACKAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nPACKAGE\n is the package you selected in the above step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring HTCondor-CE\n\n\nThere are a few required configuration steps to connect HTCondor-CE with your batch system and authentication method.\nFor more advanced configuration, see the section on \noptional configurations\n.\n\n\nConfiguring the batch system\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nHTCondor-CE must be installed on a host that is configured to submit jobs to your batch system.\nThe details of this configuration is likely site-specific and therefore beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\n\n\nEnable your batch system in the HTCondor-CE configuration by editing the \nenabled\n field in the\n\n/etc/osg/config.d/20-\nYOUR BATCH SYSTEM\n.ini\n:\n\n\nenabled = True\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using HTCondor as your \nlocal batch system\n (i.e., in addition to your HTCondor-CE), skip to the\n\nconfiguring authorization\n section.\nFor other batch systems (e.g., PBS, LSF, SGE, SLURM), keep reading.\n\n\nBatch systems other than HTCondor\n\n\nNon-HTCondor batch systems require a shared file system configuration to support file transfer from the HTCondor-CE to\nyour site's worker nodes.\nThe current recommendation is to run a dedicated NFS server (whose installation is beyond the scope of this document) on\nthe \nCE host\n.\nIn this setup, HTCondor-CE writes to the local spool directory, the NFS server shares the directory, and each worker\nnode mounts the directory in the same location as on the CE.\nFor example, if your spool directory is \n/var/lib/condor-ce\n (the default), you must mount the shared directory to\n\n/var/lib/condor-ce\n on the worker nodes.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you choose not to host the NFS server on your CE, you will need to turn off root squash so that the HTCondor-CE\ndaemons can write to the spool directory.\n\n\n\n\nYou can control the value of the spool directory by setting \nSPOOL\n in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n (create\nthis file if it doesn't exist).\nFor example, the following sets the \nSPOOL\n directory to \n/home/condor\n:\n\n\nSPOOL = /home/condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe shared spool directory must be readable and writeable by the \ncondor\n user for HTCondor-CE to function correctly.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring authorization\n\n\nTo configure which virtual organizations and users are authorized to submit jobs to your, follow the instructions in\n\nthe LCMAPS VOMS plugin document\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf your local batch system is HTCondor, it will attempt to utilize the LCMAPS callouts if enabled in the\n\ncondor_mapfile\n.\nIf this is not the desired behavior, set \nGSI_AUTHZ_CONF=/dev/null\n in the local HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring CE collector advertising\n\n\nTo split jobs between the various sites of the OSG, information about each site's capabilities are uploaded to a central\ncollector.\nThe job factories then query the central collector for idle resources and submit pilot jobs to the available sites.\nTo advertise your site, you will need to enter some information about the worker nodes of your clusters.\n\n\nPlease see the \nSubcluster / Resource Entry configuration document\n\nabout configuring the data that will be uploaded to the central collector.\n\n\nApplying configuration settings\n\n\nMaking changes to the OSG configuration files in the \n/etc/osg/config.d\n directory does not apply those settings to\nsoftware automatically.\nSettings that are made outside of the OSG directory take effect immediately or at least when the relevant service is\nrestarted.\nFor the OSG settings, use the \nosg-configure\n tool to validate (to a limited\nextent) and apply the settings to the relevant software components.\nThe \nosg-configure\n software is included automatically in an HTCondor-CE installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake all changes to \n.ini\n files in the \n/etc/osg/config.d\n directory\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis document describes the critical settings for HTCondor-CE and related software.\nYou may need to configure other software that is installed on your HTCondor-CE host, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidate the configuration settings\n\n\nroot@host #\n osg-configure -v\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFix any errors (at least) that \nosg-configure\n reports.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the validation command succeeds without errors, apply the configuration settings:\nroot@host #\n osg-configure -c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional configuration\n\n\nThe following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be required for setting up a small site.\nIf you do not need any of the following special configurations, skip to\n\nthe section on using HTCondor-CE\n.\n\n\n\n\nTransforming and filtering jobs\n\n\nConfiguring for multiple network interfaces\n\n\nLimiting or disabling locally running jobs on the CE\n\n\nAccounting with multiple CEs or local user jobs\n\n\nHTCondor accounting groups\n\n\nHTCondor-CE monitoring web interface\n\n\nEnable job retries\n\n\n\n\nTransforming and filtering jobs\n\n\nIf you need to modify or filter jobs, more information can be found in the \nJob Router Recipes\n\ndocument.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you need to assign jobs to HTCondor accounting groups, refer to \nthis\n section.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring for multiple network interfaces\n\n\nIf you have multiple network interfaces with different hostnames, the HTCondor-CE daemons need to know which hostname\nand interface to use when communicating to each other.\nSet \nNETWORK_HOSTNAME\n and \nNETWORK_INTERFACE\n to the hostname and IP address of your public interface, respectively, in\n\n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n directory with the line:\n\n\nNETWORK_HOSTNAME = condorce.example.com\nNETWORK_INTERFACE = 127.0.0.1\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n text with your public interface\u2019s hostname and \n127.0.0.1\n with your public interface\u2019s\nIP address.\n\n\nLimiting or disabling locally running jobs on the CE\n\n\nIf you want to limit or disable jobs running locally on your CE, you will need to configure HTCondor-CE's local and\nscheduler universes.\nLocal and scheduler universes allow jobs to be run on the CE itself, mainly for remote troubleshooting.\nPilot jobs will not run as local/scheduler universe jobs so leaving them enabled does NOT turn your CE into another\nworker node.\n\n\nThe two universes are effectively the same (scheduler universe launches a starter process for each job), so we will be\nconfiguring them in unison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the default limit\n on the number of locally run jobs (the current default is 20), add the following to\n  \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = TotalLocalJobsRunning + TotalSchedulerJobsRunning \n \nJOB-LIMIT\n\nSTART_SCHEDULER_UNIVERSE = $(START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nJOB-LIMIT\n is the maximum number of jobs allowed to run locally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo only allow a specific user\n to start locally run jobs, add the following to\n  \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = target.Owner =?= \nUSERNAME\n\nSTART_SCHEDULER_UNIVERSE = $(START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange \nUSERNAME\n for the username allowed to run jobs locally\n\n\n\n\nTo disable\n locally run jobs, add the following to \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\nSTART_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = False\nSTART_SCHEDULER_UNIVERSE = $(START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nRSV requires the ability to start local universe jobs so if you are using RSV, you need to allow local universe jobs\nfrom the \nrsv\n user.\n\n\n\n\nAccounting with multiple CEs or local user jobs\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor non-HTCondor batch systems only\n\n\n\n\nIf your site has multiple CEs or you have non-grid users submitting to the same local batch system, the OSG accounting\nsoftware needs to be configured so that it doesn't over

only\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to provide fairshare on a group basis, as opposed to a Unix user basis, you can use HTCondor accounting groups.\nThey are independent of the Unix groups the user may already be in and are \ndocumented in the HTCondor manual\n.\nIf you are using HTCondor accounting groups, you can map jobs from the CE into HTCondor accounting groups based on their\nUID, their DN, or their VOMS attributes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo map UIDs to an accounting group,\n add entries to \n/etc/osg/uid_table.txt\n with the following form:\n\n\nuid GroupName\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an example

To run the View,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin by installing the package htcondor-ce-view:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install htcondor-ce-view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, uncomment the \nDAEMON_LIST\n configuration located at \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/05-ce-view.conf\n:\n\n\nDAEMON_LIST = $(DAEMON_LIST), CEVIEW, GANGLIAD, SCHEDD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the CE service:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service condor-ce restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the service by entering your CE's hostname into your web browser\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe website is served on port 80 by default. To change this default, edit the value of \nHTCONDORCE_VIEW_PORT\n in\n\n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/05-ce-view.conf\n.\n\n\nEnable job retries\n\n\nIn HTCondor-CE 4+, batch system job retries are disabled by default.\nThis is because most jobs submitted through HTCondor-CEs are actually resource requests (i.e. pilot jobs) instead of\njobs containing user payloads.\nTherefore, it's preferred to prevent these jobs from retrying and instead wait for additional resource requests to be\nsubmitted.\nTo re-enable job retries, set the following in your configuration:\n\n\nENABLE_JOB_RETRIES = True\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing HTCondor-CE\n\n\nAs a site administrator, there are a few ways to use the HTCondor-CE:\n\n\n\n\nManaging the HTCondor-CE and associated services\n\n\nUsing HTCondor-CE administrative tools to monitor and maintain the job gateway\n\n\nUsing HTCondor-CE user tools to test gateway operations\n\n\n\n\nManaging HTCondor-CE and associated services\n\n\nIn addition to the HTCondor-CE job gateway service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation.\nThe specific services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch CRL\n\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n and \nfetch-crl-cron\n\n\nSee \nCA documentation\n for more info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGratia\n\n\ngratia-probes-cron\n\n\nAccounting software\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour batch system\n\n\ncondor\n or \npbs_server\n or \u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE\n\n\ncondor-ce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the services in the order listed and stop them in reverse order.

Customizations are made in the form of job routes where each route corresponds to a separate job transformation: If an incoming job matches a job route's requirements, the route creates a transformed job (referred to as the 'routed job') that is then submitted to the batch system. The CE package comes with default routes located in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-*.conf\n that provide enough basic functionality for a small site.\n\n\nIf you have needs beyond delegating all incoming jobs to your batch system as they are, this document provides examples of common job routes and job route problems.\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncoming Job\n: A job which was submitted to the CE from an outside source, such as a GlideinWMS Factory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRouted Job\n: A job which was transformed by the JobRouter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatch System\n: The underlying batch system that the HTCondor-CE will submit.  This can be Slurm, PBS, HTCondor, SGE, LSF,...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuirks and Pitfalls\n\n\n\n\nIf a value is set in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n with \neval_set_\nvariable\n, override it by using \neval_set_\nvariable\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n. Do this at your own risk as it may cause the CE to break.\n\n\nMake sure to run \ncondor_ce_reconfig\n after changing your routes, otherwise they will not take effect.\n\n\nDo \nnot\n set the job environment through the JobRouter. Instead, add any changes to the \n[Local Settings]\n section in \n/etc/osg/config.d/40-localsettings.ini\n and run osg-configure, as documented \nhere\n.\n\n\nHTCondor batch system only: Local universe jobs are excluded from any routing.\n\n\n\n\nHow Job Routes are Constructed\n\n\nEach job route\u2019s \nClassAd\n is constructed by combining each entry from the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n with the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n. Attributes that are \nset_*\n in \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n will override those \nset_*\n in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n is a configuration variable whose default is set in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-*.conf\n but may be overriden by the administrator in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n. This document outlines the many changes you can make to \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n to fit your site\u2019s needs.\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n is a python-generated configuration variable that sets default job route values that are required for the HTCondor-CE's functionality. To view its contents in a readable format, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS \n|\n sed \ns/;/;\\n/g\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf a value is set in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n with \neval_set_\nvariable\n, override it by using \neval_set_\nvariable\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n. Do this at your own risk as it may cause the CE to break.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nDo \nnot\n set the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n configuration variable yourself. This will cause the CE to stop functioning.\n\n\n\n\nHow Jobs Match to Job Routes\n\n\nThe job router considers jobs in the queue (\ncondor_ce_q\n) that\nmeet the following constraints:\n\n\n\n\nThe job has not already been considered by the job router\n\n\nThe job is associated with an unexpired x509 proxy\n\n\nThe job's universe is standard or vanilla\n\n\n\n\nIf the job meets the above constraints, then the job's ClassAd is compared against each\n\nroute's requirements\n.\nIf the job only meets one route's requirements, the job is matched to that route.\nIf the job meets the requirements of multiple routes,  the route that is chosen depends on your version of HTCondor\n(\ncondor_version\n):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your version of HTCondor is...\n\n\nThen the route is chosen by...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.7.1\n\n\nRound-robin\n between all matching routes. In this case, we recommend making each route's requirements mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= 8.7.1 and \n 8.8.7, \n= 8.9.0 and \n 8.9.5\n\n\nFirst matching route\n where routes are considered in hash-table order. In this case, we recommend making each route's requirements mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= 8.8.7, \n= 8.9.5\n\n\nFirst matching route\n where routes are considered in the order specified by \nJOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Route Order\n\n\nFor HTCondor versions \n 8.8.7 (as well as versions \n= 8.9.0 and \n 8.9.5) the order of job routes does not match the\norder in which they are configured.\nAs a result, we recommend updating to at least HTCondor 8.9.5 (or 8.8.6) and specifying the names of your routes in\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES\n in the order that you'd like them considered.\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using HTCondor \n= 8.7.1 and would like to use round-robin matching, add the following text to a file in\n\n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ROUND_ROBIN_SELECTION = True\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneric Routes\n\n\nThis section contains general information about job routes that can be used regardless of the type of batch system at your site. New routes should be placed in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n, not the original \n02-ce-*.conf\n.\n\n\nRequired fields\n\n\nThe minimum requirements for a route are that you specify the type of batch system that jobs should be routed to and a name for each route. Default routes can be found in \n/usr/share/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-\nbatch system\n-defaults.conf\n, provided by the \nosg-ce-\nbatch system\n packages.\n\n\nBatch system\n\n\nEach route needs to indicate the type of batch system that jobs should be routed to. For HTCondor batch systems, the \nTargetUniverse\n attribute needs to be set to \n5\n or \n\"vanilla\"\n. For all other batch systems, the \nTargetUniverse\n attribute needs to be set to \n9\n or \n\"grid\"\n and the \nGridResource\n attribute needs to be set to \n\"batch \nbatch system\n\"\n (where \nbatch system\n can be one of \npbs\n, \nslurm\n, \nlsf\n, or \nsge\n).\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n\n  TargetUniverse = 5;\n\n  name = \nRoute jobs to HTCondor\n;\n]\n[\n\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n\n  name = \nRoute jobs to PBS\n;\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nRoute name\n\n\nTo identify routes, you will need to assign a name to the route with the \nname\n attribute:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  TargetUniverse = 5;\n\n  name = \nRoute jobs to HTCondor\n;\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the route will be useful in debugging since it shows up in the output of \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n, the \nJobRouterLog\n, and in the ClassAd of the routed job, which can be viewed with \ncondor_ce_q\n or \ncondor_ce_history\n.\n\n\nWriting multiple routes\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBefore writing multiple routes, consider the details of \nhow jobs match to job routes\n\n\n\n\nIf your batch system needs incoming jobs to be sorted (e.g. if different VO's need to go to separate queues),\nyou will need to write multiple job routes where each route is enclosed by square brackets.\nThe following routes takes incoming jobs that have a \nqueue\n attribute set to \n\"analy\"\n and routes them to the site's\nHTCondor batch system.\nAny other jobs will be sent to that site's PBS batch system.\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n\n[\n\n  TargetUniverse = 5;\n  name = \nRoute jobs to HTCondor\n;\n  Requirements = (TARGET.queue =?= \nanaly\n);\n\n]\n\n[\n\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nRoute jobs to PBS\n;\n  Requirements = (TARGET.queue =!= \nanaly\n);\n\n]\n\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting comments\n\n\nTo write comments you can use \n#\n to comment a line:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  TargetUniverse = 5;\n  name = \n# comments\n;\n\n  # This is a comment\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting attributes for all routes\n\n\nTo set an attribute that will be applied to all routes, you will need to ensure that \nMERGE_JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULT_ADS\n is set to \nTrue\n (check the value with \ncondor_ce_config_val\n) and use the \nset_\n function in the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n. The following configuration sets the \nPeriodic_Hold\n attribute for all routes:\n\n\n# Use the defaults generated by the condor_ce_router_defaults script.  To add\n# additional defaults, add additional lines of the form:\n#\n#   JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS = $(JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS) [set_foo = 1;]\n#\nMERGE_JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULT_ADS=True\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS = $(JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS) [set_Periodic_Hold = (NumJobStarts \n= 1 \n JobStatus == 1) || NumJobStarts \n 1;]\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering jobs based on\u2026\n\n\nTo filter jobs, use the \nRequirements\n attribute. Jobs will evaluate against the ClassAd expression set in the \nRequirements\n and if the expression evaluates to \nTRUE\n, the route will match. More information on the syntax of ClassAd's can be found in the \nHTCondor manual\n. For an example on how incoming jobs interact with filtering in job routes, consult \nthis document\n.\n\n\nWhen setting requirements, you need to prefix job attributes that you are filtering with \nTARGET.\n so that the job route knows to compare the attribute of the incoming job rather than the route\u2019s own attribute. For example, if an incoming job has a \nqueue = \"analy\"\n attribute, then the following job route will not match:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  TargetUniverse = 5;\n  name = \nFiltering by queue\n;\n  queue = \nnot-analy\n;\n\n  Requirements = (queue =?= \nanaly\n);\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is because when evaluating the route requirement, the job route will compare its own \nqueue\n attribute to \"analy\" and see that it does not match. You can read more about comparing two ClassAds in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you have an HTCondor batch system, note the difference with \nset_requirements\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBefore writing multiple routes, consider the details of \nhow jobs match to job routes\n.\n\n\n\n\nGlidein queue\n\n\nTo filter jobs based on their glidein queue attribute, your routes will need a \nRequirements\n expression using the incoming job's \nqueue\n attribute. The following entry routes jobs to PBS if the incoming job (specified by \nTARGET\n) is an \nanaly\n (Analysis) glidein:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  TargetUniverse = 5;\n  name = \nFiltering by queue\n;\n\n  Requirements = (TARGET.queue =?= \nanaly\n);\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nJob submitter\n\n\nTo filter jobs based on who submitted it, your routes will need a \nRequirements\n expression using the incoming job's \nOwner\n attribute. The following entry routes jobs to the HTCondor batch system if the submitter is \nusatlas2\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  TargetUniverse = 5;\n  name = \nFiltering by job submitter\n;\n\n  Requirements = (TARGET.Owner =?= \nusatlas2\n);\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can match based on regular expression. The following entry routes jobs to the PBS batch system if the submitter's name begins with \nusatlas\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nFiltering by job submitter (regular expression)\n;\n\n  Requirements = regexp(\n^usatlas\n, TARGET.Owner);\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nVOMS attribute\n\n\nTo filter jobs based on the subject of the job's proxy, your routes will need a \nRequirements\n expression using the incoming job's \nx509UserProxyFirstFQAN\n attribute. The following entry routes jobs to the PBS batch system if the proxy subject contains \n/cms/Role=Pilot\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nFiltering by VOMS attribute (regex)\n;\n\n  Requirements = regexp(\n\\/cms\\/Role\\=pilot\n, TARGET.x509UserProxyFirstFQAN);\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting a default\u2026\n\n\nThis section outlines how to set default job limits, memory, cores, and maximum walltime. For an example on how users can override these defaults, consult \nthis document\n.\n\n\nMaximum number of jobs\n\n\nTo set a default limit to the maximum number of jobs per route, you can edit the configuration variable \nCONDORCE_MAX_JOBS\n in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/01-ce-router.conf\n:\n\n\nCONDORCE_MAX_JOBS = 10000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe above configuration is to be placed directly into the HTCondor-CE configuration, not into a job route.\n\n\n\n\nMaximum memory\n\n\nTo set a default maximum memory (in MB) for routed jobs, set the attribute \ndefault_maxMemory\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nRequest memory\n;\n  # Set the requested memory to 1 GB\n\n  set_default_maxMemory = 1000;\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of cores to request\n\n\nTo set a default number of cores for routed jobs, set the attribute \ndefault_xcount\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nRequest CPU\n;\n  # Set the requested cores to 8\n\n  set_default_xcount = 8;\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum walltime\n\n\nTo set a default maximum walltime (in minutes) for routed jobs, set the attribute \ndefault_maxWallTime\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nSetting WallTime\n;\n  # Set the max walltime to 1 hr\n\n  set_default_maxWallTime = 60;\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nEditing attributes\u2026\n\n\nThe following functions are operations that affect job attributes and are evaluated in the following order:\n\n\n\n\ncopy_*\n\n\ndelete_*\n\n\nset_*\n\n\neval_set_*\n\n\n\n\nAfter each job route\u2019s ClassAd is \nconstructed\n, the above operations are evaluated in order. For example, if the attribute \nfoo\n is set using \neval_set_foo\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n, you'll be unable to use \ndelete_foo\n to remove it from your jobs since the attribute is set using \neval_set_foo\n after the deletion occurs according to the order of operations. To get around this, we can take advantage of the fact that operations defined in \nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n get overridden by the same operation in \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n. So to 'delete' \nfoo\n, we would add \neval_set_foo = \"\"\n to the route in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n, resulting in \nfoo\n being absent from the routed job.\n\n\nMore documentation can be found in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\nCopying attributes\n\n\nTo copy the value of an attribute of the incoming job to an attribute of the routed job, use \ncopy_\n. The following route copies the \nenvironment\n attribute of the incoming job and sets the attribute \nOriginal_Environment\n on the routed job to the same value:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nCopying attributes\n;\n\n  copy_environment = \nOriginal_Environment\n;\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving attributes\n\n\nTo remove an attribute of the incoming job from the routed job, use \ndelete_\n. The following route removes the \nenvironment\n attribute from the routed job:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nCopying attributes\n;\n\n  delete_environment = True;\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting attributes\n\n\nTo set an attribute on the routed job, use \nset_\n. The following route sets the Job's \nRank\n attribute to 5:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nSetting an attribute\n;\n\n  set_Rank = 5;\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting attributes with ClassAd expressions\n\n\nTo set an attribute to a ClassAd expression to be evaluated, use \neval_set\n. The following route sets the \nExperiment\n attribute to \natlas.osguser\n if the Owner of the incoming job is \nosguser\n:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf a value is set in JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS with \neval_set_\nvariable\n, override it by using \neval_set_\nvariable\n in the \nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES\n.\n\n\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nSetting an attribute with a !ClassAd expression\n;\n\n  eval_set_Experiment = strcat(\natlas.\n, Owner);\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nLimiting the number of jobs\n\n\nThis section outlines how to limit the number of total or idle jobs in a specific route (i.e., if this limit is reached, jobs will no longer be placed in this route).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are using an HTCondor batch system, limiting the number of jobs is not the preferred solution: HTCondor manages fair share on its own via \nuser priorities and group accounting\n.\n\n\n\n\nTotal jobs\n\n\nTo set a limit on the number of jobs for a specific route, set the \nMaxJobs\n attribute:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nLimit the total number of jobs to 100\n;\n\n  MaxJobs = 100;\n\n]\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nLimit the total number of jobs to 75\n;\n\n  MaxJobs = 75;\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nIdle jobs\n\n\nTo set a limit on the number of idle jobs for a specific route, set the \nMaxIdleJobs\n attribute:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  TargetUniverse = 5;\n  name = \nLimit the total number of idle jobs to 100\n;\n\n  MaxIdleJobs = 100;\n\n]\n[\n  TargetUniverse = 5;\n  name = \nLimit the total number of idle jobs to 75\n;\n\n  MaxIdleJobs = 75;\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugging routes\n\n\nTo help debug expressions in your routes, you can use the \ndebug()\n function. First, set the debug mode for the JobRouter by editing a file in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/\n to read\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEBUG = D_ALWAYS:2 D_CAT\n\n\n\n\n\nThen wrap the problematic attribute in \ndebug()\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nDebugging a difficult !ClassAd expression\n;\n\n  eval_set_Experiment = debug(strcat(\natlas\n, Name));\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will find the debugging output in \n/var/log/condor-ce/JobRouterLog\n.\n\n\nRoutes for HTCondor Batch Systems\n\n\nThis section contains information about job routes that can be used if you are running an HTCondor batch system at your site.\n\n\nSetting periodic hold, release or remove\n\n\nTo release, remove or put a job on hold if it meets certain criteria, use the \nPERIODIC_*\n family of attributes. By default, periodic expressions are evaluated once every 300 seconds but this can be changed by setting \nPERIODIC_EXPR_INTERVAL\n in your CE's configuration.\n\n\nIn this example, we set the routed job on hold if the job is idle and has been started at least once or if the job has tried to start more than once.  This will catch jobs which are starting and stopping multiple times.\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  TargetUniverse = 5;\n  name = \nSetting periodic statements\n;\n  # Puts the routed job on hold if the job\ns been idle and has been started at least once or if the job has tried to start more than once\n\n  set_Periodic_Hold = (NumJobStarts \n= 1 \n JobStatus == 1) || NumJobStarts \n 1;\n\n  # Remove routed jobs if their walltime is longer than 3 days and 5 minutes\n  set_Periodic_Remove = ( RemoteWallClockTime \n (3*24*60*60 + 5*60) );\n  # Release routed jobs if the condor_starter couldn\nt start the executable and \nVMGAHP_ERR_INTERNAL\n is in the HoldReason\n\n  set_Periodic_Release = HoldReasonCode == 6 \n regexp(\nVMGAHP_ERR_INTERNAL\n, HoldReason);\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting routed job requirements\n\n\nIf you need to set requirements on your routed job, you will need to use \nset_Requirements\n instead of \nRequirements\n. The \nRequirements\n attribute filters jobs coming into your CE into different job routes whereas \nset_Requirements\n will set conditions on the routed job that must be met by the worker node it lands on. For more information on requirements, consult the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\nTo ensure that your job lands on a Linux machine in your pool:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  TargetUniverse = 5;\n\n  set_Requirements =  OpSys == \nLINUX\n;\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting accounting groups\n\n\nTo assign jobs to an HTCondor accounting group to manage fair share on your local batch system, we recommend using \nUID and ExtAttr tables\n.\n\n\nRoutes for non-HTCondor Batch Systems\n\n\nThis section contains information about job routes that can be used if you are running a non-HTCondor batch system at your site.\n\n\nSetting a default batch queue\n\n\nTo set a default queue for routed jobs, set the attribute \ndefault_queue\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre\n[\n  GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n  TargetUniverse = 9;\n  name = \nSetting batch system queues\n;\n\n  set_default_queue = \nosg_queue\n;\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting batch system directives\n\n\nTo write batch system directives that are not supported in the route examples above, you will need to edit the job\nsubmit script for your local batch system in \n/etc/blahp/\n (e.g., if your local batch system is PBS, edit\n\n/etc/blahp/pbs_local_submit_attributes.sh\n).\nThis file is sourced during submit time and anything printed to stdout is appended to the batch system job submit\nscript.\nClassAd attributes can be passed from the routed job to the local submit attributes script through one of the following\nmethods, depending on your version of HTCondor-CE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor HTCondor-CE \n= 4:\n use \nset_default_CERequirements\n, which takes a comma-separated list of other attributes:\n\n\nset_foo = 42;\nset_bar = \nbaz\n;\nset_default_CERequirements = \nfoo,bar\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor HTCondor-CE \n 4:\n use \nset_default_remote_cerequirements\n, which takes the following form:\n\n\nset_default_remote_cerequirements = \nfoo == 42 \n bar == \\\nbaz\\\n \n ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that escaped double-quotes are required for string values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of the examples above set \nfoo\n to value \n42\n and \nbar\n to the string \nbaz\n in the environment of the local submit\nattributes script.\nThe following examples set the maximum walltime to 1 hour and the accounting group to the \nx509UserProxyFirstFQAN\n\nattribute of the job submitted to a PBS batch system:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor HTCondor-CE \n= 4\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre [\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n     name = \nSetting job submit variables\n;\n\n     set_Walltime = 3600;\n\n     set_AccountingGroup = x509UserProxyFirstFQAN;\n\n     set_default_CERequirements = \nWalltime,AccountingGroup\n;\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor HTCondor-CE \n 4\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES @=jre [\n     GridResource = \nbatch pbs\n;\n     name = \nSetting job submit variables\n;\n\n     set_default_remote_cerequirements = strcat(\nWalltime == 3600 \n AccountingGroup ==\n, x509UserProxyFirstFQAN, \n\\\n);\n\n]\n@jre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith \n/etc/blahp/pbs_local_submit_attributes.sh\n containing.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\necho\n \n#PBS -l walltime=\n$Walltime\n\n\necho\n \n#PBS -A \n$AccountingGroup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in the following being appended to the script that gets submitted to your batch system:\n\n\n#PBS -l walltime=3600\n#PBS -A \nCE job\ns x509UserProxyFirstFQAN attribute\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\n\nHere are some other HTCondor-CE documents that might be helpful:\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE overview and architecture\n\n\nInstalling HTCondor-CE\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE troubleshooting guide\n\n\nSubmitting jobs to HTCondor-CE\n\n\n\n\nExample Configurations\n\n\nAGLT2's job routes\n\n\nAtlas AGLT2 is using an HTCondor batch system.

            "text": "HTCondor-CE Troubleshooting Guide\n\n\nIn this document, you will find a collection of files and commands to help troubleshoot HTCondor-CE along with a list of\ncommon issues with suggested troubleshooting steps.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS are not applied to jobs on the local HTCondor\n\n\nIf you are adding attributes to jobs submitted to your HTCondor pool with \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n, these will \nnot\n be applied to\njobs that are entering your pool from the HTCondor-CE. \nTo get around this, you will want to add the attributes to your \njob routes\n. \nIf the CE is the only entry point for jobs into your pool, you can get rid of \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n on your backend. Otherwise,\nyou will have to maintain your list of attributes both in your list of routes and in your \nSUBMIT_EXPRS\n.\n\n\nGeneral Troubleshooting Items\n\n\nMaking sure packages are up-to-date\n\n\nIt is important to make sure that the HTCondor-CE and related RPMs are up-to-date.\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update \nhtcondor-ce*\n blahp condor\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you just want to see the packages to update, but do not want to perform the update now, answer \nN\n at the prompt.\n\n\nVerify package contents\n\n\nIf the contents of your HTCondor-CE packages have been changed, the CE may cease to function properly. To verify the\ncontents of your packages (ignoring changes to configuration files):\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -q --verify htcondor-ce htcondor-ce-client blahp \n|\n grep -v \n/var/\n \n|\n awk \n$2 != \nc\n {print $0}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the verification command returns output, this means that your packages have been changed. To fix this, you can\nreinstall the packages:\n\n\nuser@host $\n yum reinstall htcondor-ce htcondor-ce-client blahp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe reinstall command may place original versions of configuration files alongside the versions that you have modified. If this is the case, the reinstall command will notify you that the original versions will have an \n.rpmnew\n suffix. Further inspection of these files may be required as to whether or not you need to merge them into your current configuration.\n\n\n\n\nVerify clocks are synchronized\n\n\nLike all GSI-based authentication, HTCondor-CE is sensitive to time skews. Make sure the clock on your CE is\nsynchronized using a utility such as \nntpd\n. \nAdditionally, HTCondor itself is sensitive to time skews on the NFS server.\nIf you see empty stdout / err being returned to the submitter, verify there is no NFS server time skew.\n\n\nVerify host cerificates and CRLs are valid\n\n\nAn expired host certificate or CRLs will cause various issues with GSI authentication. \nVerify that your host certificate is valid by running:\n\n\nroot@host #\n openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -noout -dates\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, run the \nfetch-crl\n script to update your CRLs:\n\n\nroot@host #\n fetch-crl\n\n\n\n\n\nIf updating CRLs fix your issues, make sure that the \nfetch-crl-cron\n and\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n services are enabled and running.\n\n\nHTCondor-CE Troubleshooting Items\n\n\nThis section contains common issues you may encounter using HTCondor-CE and next actions to take when you do. \nBefore troubleshooting, we recommend increasing the log level:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite the following into \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n to increase the log level for all daemons:\n\n\nALL_DEBUG = D_ALWAYS:2 D_CAT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that the configuration is in place:\n\n\nroot@host # condor_ce_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproduce the issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBefore spending any time on troubleshooting, you should ensure that the state of configuration is as expected by running \ncondor_ce_reconfig\n.\n\n\n\n\nDaemons fail to start\n\n\nIf there are errors in your configuration of HTCondor-CE, this may cause some of its required daemons to fail to\nstartup. \nCheck the following subsections in order:\n\n\nSymptoms\n\n\nDaemon startup failure may manifest in many ways, the following are few symptoms of the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service fails to start:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service condor-ce start\n\nStarting Condor-CE daemons: [ FAIL ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n fails with a lengthy error message:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q\n\nError:\n\n\n\nExtra Info: You probably saw this error because the condor_schedd is not running\n\n\non the machine you are trying to query. If the condor_schedd is not running, the\n\n\nCondor system will not be able to find an address and port to connect to and\n\n\nsatisfy this request. Please make sure the Condor daemons are running and try\n\n\nagain.\n\n\n\nExtra Info: If the condor_schedd is running on the machine you are trying to\n\n\nquery and you still see the error, the most likely cause is that you have setup\n\n\na personal Condor, you have not defined SCHEDD_NAME in your condor_config file,\n\n\nand something is wrong with your SCHEDD_ADDRESS_FILE setting. You must define\n\n\neither or both of those settings in your config file, or you must use the -name\n\n\noption to condor_q. Please see the Condor manual for details on SCHEDD_NAME and\n\n\nSCHEDD_ADDRESS_FILE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nIf the MasterLog is filled with \nERROR:SECMAN...TCP connection to collector...failed\n:\n This is likely due to a misconfiguration for a host with multiple network interfaces. Verify that you have followed the instructions in \nthis\n section of the install guide.\n\n\nIf the MasterLog is filled with \nDC_AUTHENTICATE\n errors:\n The HTCondor-CE daemons use the host certificate to authenticate with each other. Verify that your host certificate\u2019s DN matches one of the regular expressions found in \n/etc/condor-ce/condor_mapfile\n.\n\n\nIf the SchedLog is filled with \nCan\u2019t find address for negotiator\n:\n You can ignore this error! The negotiator daemon is used in HTCondor batch systems to match jobs with resources but since HTCondor-CE does not manage any resources directly, it does not run one.\n\n\n\n\nJobs fail to submit to the CE\n\n\nIf a user is having issues submitting jobs to the CE and you've ruled out general connectivity or firewalls as the\nculprit, then you may have encountered an authentication or authorization issue. \nYou may see error messages like the following in your \nSchedLog\n:\n\n\n08/30/16 16:52:56 DC_AUTHENTICATE: required authentication of 72.33.0.189 failed: AUTHENTICATE:1003:Failed to authenticate with any method|AUTHENTICATE:1004:Failed to authenticate using GSI|GSI:5002:Failed to authenticate because the remote (client) side was not able to acquire its credentials.|AUTHENTICATE:1004:Failed to authenticate using FS|FS:1004:Unable to lstat(/tmp/FS_XXXZpUlYa)\n08/30/16 16:53:12 PERMISSION DENIED to gsi@unmapped from host 72.33.0.189 for command 60021 (DC_NOP_WRITE), access level WRITE: reason: WRITE authorization policy contains no matching ALLOW entry for this request; identifiers used for this host: 72.33.0.189,dyn-72-33-0-189.uwnet.wisc.edu, hostname size = 1, original ip address = 72.33.0.189\n08/30/16 16:53:12 DC_AUTHENTICATE: Command not authorized, done!\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nCheck voms-mapfile or grid-mapfile\n and ensure that the user's DN or VOMS attributes are known to your\n    \nauthentication method\n, and that the mapped users exist\n    on your CE and cluster.\n\n\nCheck for lcmaps errors\n in \n/var/log/messages\n\n\nIf you do not see helpful error messages in \n/var/log/messages\n,\n adjust the debug level by adding \nexport LCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL=5\n to \n/etc/sysconfig/condor-ce\n, restarting the condor-ce service, and checking \n/var/log/messages\n for errors again.\n\n\n\n\nJobs stay idle on the CE\n\n\nCheck the following subsections in order, but note that jobs may take several minutes or longer to run if the CE is\nbusy.\n\n\nIdle jobs on CE: Make sure the underlying batch system can run jobs\n\n\nHTCondor-CE delegates jobs to your batch system, which is then responsible for matching jobs to worker nodes.\nIf you cannot manually submit jobs (e.g., \ncondor_submit\n, \nqsub\n) on the CE host to your batch system, then HTCondor-CE\nwon't be able to either.\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\nManually create and submit a simple job (e.g., one that runs \nsleep\n)\n\n\nCheck for errors in the submission itself\n\n\nWatch the job in the batch system queue (e.g., \ncondor_q\n, \nqstat\n)\n\n\nIf the job does not run, check for errors on the batch system\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\nConsult troubleshooting documentation or support avenues for your batch system.\nOnce you can run simple manual jobs on your batch system, try submitting to the HTCondor-CE again.\n\n\nIdle jobs on CE: Is the job router handling the incoming job?\n\n\nJobs on the CE will be put on hold if they do not match any job routes after 30 minutes, but you can check a few things\nif you suspect that the jobs are not being matched. \nCheck if the JobRouter sees a job before that by looking at the \njob router log\n and looking for the text\n\nsrc=\nJOB-ID\n\u2026claimed job\n.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n to see why your idle job does not match any routes\n\n\nIdle jobs on CE: Verify correct operation between the CE and your local batch system\n\n\nFor HTCondor batch systems\n\n\nHTCondor-CE submits jobs directly to an HTCondor batch system via the JobRouter, so any issues with the CE/local batch\nsystem interaction will appear in the \nJobRouterLog\n.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nCheck the \nJobRouterLog\n for failures.\n\n\nVerify that the local HTCondor is functional.\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_config_val\n to verify that the \nJOB_ROUTER_SCHEDD2_NAME\n, \nJOB_ROUTER_SCHEDD2_POOL\n, and \nJOB_ROUTER_SCHEDD2_SPOOL\n configuration variables are set to the hostname of your CE, the hostname and port of your local HTCondor\u2019s collector, and the location of your local HTCondor\u2019s spool directory, respectively.\n\n\nUse \ncondor_config_val QUEUE_SUPER_USER_MAY_IMPERSONATE\n and verify that it is set to \n.*\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor non-HTCondor batch systems\n\n\nHTCondor-CE submits jobs to a non-HTCondor batch system via the Gridmanager, so any issues with the CE/local batch\nsystem interaction will appear in the \nGridmanagerLog\n. \nLook for \ngm state change\u2026\n lines to figure out where the issures are occuring.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nIf you see failures in the GridmanagerLog during job submission:\n Save the submit files by adding the appropriate entry to \nblah.config\n and submit it \nmanually\n to the batch system. If that succeeds, make sure that the BLAHP knows where your binaries are located by setting the \nbatch system\n_binpath\n in \n/etc/blah.config\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you see failures in the GridmanagerLog during queries for job status:\n Query the resultant job with your batch system tools from the CE. If you can, the BLAHP uses scripts to query for status in \n/usr/libexec/blahp/\nbatch system\n_status.sh\n (e.g., \n/usr/libexec/blahp/lsf_status.sh\n) that take the argument \nbatch system/YYYMMDD/job ID\n (e.g., \nlsf/20141008/65053\n). Run the appropriate status script for your batch system and upon success, you should see the following output:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /usr/libexec/blahp/lsf_status.sh lsf/20141008/65053\n\n[ BatchjobId = \n894862\n; JobStatus = 4; ExitCode = 0; WorkerNode = \natl-prod08\n ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the script fails, \nrequest help\n from the OSG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdle jobs on CE: Verify ability to change permissions on key files\n\n\nHTCondor-CE needs the ability to write and chown files in its \nspool\n directory and if it cannot, jobs will not run at\nall. \nSpool permission errors can appear in the \nSchedLog\n and the \nJobRouterLog\n.\n\n\nSymptoms\n\n\n09/17/14 14:45:42 Error: Unable to chown \n/var/lib/condor-ce/spool/1/0/cluster1.proc0.subproc0/env\n from 12345 to 54321\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nAs root, try to change ownership of the file or directory in question. If the file does not exist, a parent directory may have improper permissions.\n\n\nVerify that there aren't any underlying file system issues in the specified location\n\n\n\n\nJobs stay idle on a remote host submitting to the CE\n\n\nIf you are submitting your job from a separate submit host to the CE, it stays idle in the queue forever, and you do not\nsee a resultant job in the CE's queue, this means that your job cannot contact the CE for submission or it is not\nauthorized to run there. \nNote that jobs may take several minutes or longer if the CE is busy.\n\n\nRemote idle jobs: Can you contact the CE?\n\n\nTo check basic connectivity to a CE, use \ncondor_ce_ping\n:\n\n\nSymptoms\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ping -verbose -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 WRITE\n\nERROR: couldn\nt locate condorce.example.com!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the HTCondor-CE daemons are running with \ncondor_ce_status\n.\n\n\nVerify that your CE is

attribute that can be inspected with \ncondor_ce_q\n:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -l \nJOB-ID\n -attr HoldReason\n\nHoldReason = \nCE job in status 5 put on hold by SYSTEM_PERIODIC_HOLD due to no matching routes, route job limit, or route failure threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeld jobs: no matching routes, route job limit, or route failure threshold\n\n\nJobs on the CE will be put on hold if they are not claimed by the job router within 30 minutes.\nThe most common cases for this behavior are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe job does not match any job routes:\n\n  use \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n to see why your idle job does not match any\n  \nroutes\n.\n\n\nThe route(s) that the job matches to are full:\n\n  See \nlimiting the number of jobs\n.\n\n\nThe job router is throttling submission to your batch system due to submission failures:\n\n  See the HTCondor manual for \nFailureRateThreshold\n.\n  Check for errors in the \nJobRouterLog\n or \nGridmanagerLog\n for HTCondor and\n  non-HTCondor batch systems, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nHeld jobs: Missing/expired user proxy\n\n\nHTCondor-CE requires a valid user proxy for each job that is submitted. \nYou can check the status of your proxy with the following\n\n\nuser@host $\n voms-proxy-info -all\n\n\n\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\nEnsure that the owner of the job generates their proxy with \nvoms-proxy-init\n.\n\n\nHeld jobs: Invalid job universe\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE only accepts jobs that have \nuniverse\n in their submit files set to \nvanilla\n, \nstandard\n, \nlocal\n, or\n\nscheduler\n. \nThese universes also have corresponding integer values that can be found in the \nHTCondor\nmanual\n.\n\n\nNext actions\n\n\n\n\nEnsure jobs submitted locally, from the CE host, are submitted with \nuniverse = vanilla\n\n\n\n\nEnsure jobs submitted from a remote submit point are submitted with:\n\n\nuniverse = grid\ngrid_resource = condor condorce.example.com condorce.example.com:9619\n\n\n\n\n\nreplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying the corresponding job ID on the local batch system\n\n\nWhen troubleshooting interactions between your CE and your local batch system, you will need to associate the CE job ID\nand the resultant job ID on the batch system. \nThe methods for finding the resultant job ID differs between batch systems.\n\n\nHTCondor batch systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect the CE\u2019s job ad, use \ncondor_ce_q\n or \ncondor_ce_history\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_q\n if the job is still in the CE\u2019s queue:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q \nJOB-ID\n -af RoutedToJobId\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_history\n if the job has left the CE\u2019s queue:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_history \nJOB-ID\n -af RoutedToJobId\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParse the \nJobRouterLog\n for the CE\u2019s job ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-HTCondor batch systems\n\n\nWhen HTCondor-CE records the corresponding batch system job ID, it is written in the form \nBATCH-SYSTEM\n/\nDATE\n/\nJOB\nID\n:\n\n\nlsf/20141206/482046\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect the CE\u2019s job ad, use \ncondor_ce_q\n:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q \nJOB-ID\n -af GridJobId\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParse the \nGridmanagerLog\n for the CE\u2019s job ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs removed from the local HTCondor pool become resubmitted (HTCondor batch systems only)\n\n\nBy design, HTCondor-CE will resubmit jobs that have been removed from the underlying HTCondor pool. \nTherefore, to remove misbehaving jobs, they will need to be removed on the CE level following these steps:\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the misbehaving job ID in your batch system queue\n\n\n\n\nFind the job's corresponding CE job ID:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_q \nJOB-ID\n -af RoutedFromJobId\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \ncondor_ce_rm\n to remove the CE job from the queue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing HTCondor tools\n\n\nMost of the HTCondor-CE tools are just wrappers around existing HTCondor tools that load the CE-specific config. \nIf you are trying to use HTCondor-CE tools and you see the following error:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_job_router_info\n\n/usr/bin/condor_ce_job_router_info: line 6: exec: condor_job_router_info: not found\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that the \ncondor_job_router_info\n (note this is not the CE version), is not in your \nPATH\n.\n\n\nNext Actions\n\n\n\n\nEither the condor RPM is missing or there are some other issues with it (try \nrpm --verify condor\n).\n\n\nYou have installed HTCondor in a non-standard location that is not in your \nPATH\n.\n\n\nThe \ncondor_job_router_info\n tool itself wasn't available until Condor-8.2.3-1.1 (available in osg-upcoming).\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE Troubleshooting Tools\n\n\nHTCondor-CE has its own separate set of of the HTCondor tools with \nce\n in the name (i.e., \ncondor_ce_submit\n vs\n\ncondor_submit\n). \nSome of the the commands are only for the CE (e.g., \ncondor_ce_run\n and \ncondor_ce_trace\n) but many of them are just\nHTCondor commands configured to interact with the CE (e.g., \ncondor_ce_q\n, \ncondor_ce_status\n). \nIt is important to differentiate the two: \ncondor_ce_config_val\n will provide configuration values for your HTCondor-CE\nwhile\n\ncondor_config_val\n will provide configuration values for your HTCondor batch system. \nIf you are not running an HTCondor batch system, the non-CE commands will return errors.\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n\n\nUsage\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n is a useful tool for testing end-to-end job submission. It contacts both the CE\u2019s Schedd and Collector daemons to verify your permission to submit to the CE, displays the submit script that it submits to the CE, and tracks the resultant job.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou must have generated a proxy (e.g., \nvoms-proxy-init\n) and your DN must be added to your \nchosen authentication method\n.\n\n\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_trace condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing the \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE. \nIf you are familiar with the output of condor commands, the command also takes a \n--debug\n option that displays verbose\ncondor output.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nIf the command fails with \u201cFailed ping\u2026\u201d:\n Make sure that the HTCondor-CE daemons are running on the CE\n\n\nIf you see \u201cgsi@unmapped\u201d in the \u201cRemote Mapping\u201d line:\n Either your credentials are not mapped on the CE or authentication is not set up at all. To set up authentication, refer to our \ninstallation document\n.\n\n\nIf the job submits but does not complete:\n Look at the status of the job and perform the relevant \ntroubleshooting steps\n.\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_host_network_check\n\n\nUsage\n\n\ncondor_ce_host_network_check\n is a tool for testing an HTCondor-CE's networking configuration:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_host_network_check\n\nStarting analysis of host networking for HTCondor-CE\n\n\nSystem hostname: fermicloud360.fnal.gov\n\n\nFQDN matches hostname\n\n\nForward resolution of hostname fermicloud360.fnal.gov is 131.225.155.96.\n\n\nBackward resolution of IPv4 131.225.155.96 is fermicloud360.fnal.gov.\n\n\nForward and backward resolution match!\n\n\nHTCondor is considering all network interfaces and addresses.\n\n\nHTCondor would pick address of 131.225.155.96 as primary address.\n\n\nHTCondor primary address 131.225.155.96 matches system preferred address.\n\n\nHost network configuration should work with HTCondor-CE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf the tool reports that \nHost network configuration not expected to work with HTCondor-CE\n, ensure that forward and\nreverse DNS resolution return the public IP and hostname.\n\n\ncondor_ce_run\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nSimilar to \nglobus-job-run\n, \ncondor_ce_run\n is a tool that submits a simple job to your CE, so it is useful for quickly\nsubmitting jobs through your CE. \nTo submit a job to the CE and run the \nenv\n command on the remote batch system:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou must have generated a proxy (e.g., \nvoms-proxy-init\n) and your DN must be added to your \nchosen authentication method\n.\n\n\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_run -r condorce.example.com:9619 /bin/env\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing the \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE. \nIf you are troubleshooting an HTCondor-CE that you do not have a login for and the CE accepts local universe jobs, you\ncan run commands locally on the CE with \ncondor_ce_run\n with the \n-l\n option. \nThe following example outputs the JobRouterLog of the CE in question:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_run -lr condorce.example.com:9619 cat /var/log/condor-ce/JobRouterLog\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing the \ncondorce.example.com\n text with the hostname of the CE. \nTo disable this feature on your CE, consult\n\nthis\n section of the install documentation.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not see any results:\n \ncondor_ce_run\n does not display results until the job completes on the CE, which may take several minutes or longer if the CE is busy. In the meantime, can use \ncondor_ce_q\n in a separate terminal to track the job on the CE. If you never see any results, use \ncondor_ce_trace\n to pinpoint errors.\n\n\nIf you see an error message that begins with \u201cFailed to\u2026\u201d:\n Check connectivity to the CE with \ncondor_ce_trace\n or \ncondor_ce_ping\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_submit\n\n\nSee the \nsubmitting to HTCondor-CE\n document for details.\n\n\ncondor_ce_ping\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nUse the following \ncondor_ce_ping\n command to test your ability to submit jobs to an HTCondor-CE, replacing\n\ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of your CE:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_ping -verbose -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 WRITE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following shows successful output where I am able to submit jobs (\nAuthorized: TRUE\n) as the glow user (\nRemote\nMapping: glow@users.opensciencegrid.org\n):\n\n\nRemote Version:              $CondorVersion: 8.0.7 Sep 24 2014 $\n\n\nLocal  Version:              $CondorVersion: 8.0.7 Sep 24 2014 $\n\n\nSession ID:                  condorce:27407:1412286981:3\n\n\nInstruction:                 WRITE\n\n\nCommand:                     60021\n\n\nEncryption:                  none\n\n\nIntegrity:                   MD5\n\n\nAuthenticated using:         GSI\n\n\nAll authentication methods:  GSI\n\n\nRemote Mapping:              glow@users.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\nAuthorized:                  TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you run the \ncondor_ce_ping\n command on the CE that you are testing, omit the \n-name\n and \n-pool\n options. \ncondor_ce_ping\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_ping\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see \u201cERROR: couldn\u2019t locate (null)\u201d\n, that means the HTCondor-CE schedd (the daemon that schedules jobs) cannot be reached. To track down the issue, increase debugging levels on the CE:\n\n\nMASTER_DEBUG = D_ALWAYS:2 D_CAT\nSCHEDD_DEBUG = D_ALWAYS:2 D_CAT\n\n\n\n\n\nThen look in the \nMasterLog\n and \nSchedLog\n for any errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see \u201cgsi@unmapped\u201d in the \u201cRemote Mapping\u201d line\n, this means that either your credentials are not mapped on the CE or that authentication is not set up at all. To set up authentication, refer to our \ninstallation document\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n\n\nUsage\n\n\ncondor_ce_q\n can display job status or specific job attributes for jobs that are still in the CE\u2019s queue. To list jobs that are queued on a CE:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect the full ClassAd for a specific job, specify the \n-l\n flag and the job ID:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 -l \nJOB-ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you run the \ncondor_ce_q\n command on the CE that you are testing, omit the \n-name\n and \n-pool\n options. \ncondor_ce_q\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_q\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf the jobs that you are submiting to a CE are not completing, \ncondor_ce_q\n can tell you the status of your jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the schedd is not running:\n You will see a lengthy message about being unable to contact the schedd. To track down the issue, increase the debugging levels on the CE with:\n\n\nMASTER_DEBUG = D_ALWAYS:2 D_CAT\nSCHEDD_DEBUG = D_ALWAYS:2 D_CAT\n\n\n\n\n\nTo apply these changes, reconfigure HTCondor-CE:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\nThen look in the \nMasterLog\n and \nSchedLog\n on the CE for any errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are issues with contacting the collector:\n You will see the following message:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -pool ce1.accre.vanderbilt.edu -name ce1.accre.vanderbilt.edu\n\n\n-- Failed to fetch ads from: \n129.59.197.223:9620?sock`33630_8b33_4\n : ce1.accre.vanderbilt.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may be due to network issues or bad HTCondor daemon permissions. To fix the latter issue, ensure that the \nALLOW_READ\n configuration value is not set:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val -v ALLOW_READ\n\nNot defined: ALLOW_READ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it is defined, remove it from the file that is returned in the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a job is held:\n There should be an accompanying \nHoldReason\n that will tell you why it is being held. The \nHoldReason\n is in the job\u2019s ClassAd, so you can use the long form of \ncondor_ce_q\n to extract its value:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 -l \nJob ID\n \n|\n grep HoldReason\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a job is idle:\n The most common cause is that it is not matching any routes in the CE\u2019s job router. To find out whether this is the case, use the \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_history\n\n\nUsage\n\n\ncondor_ce_history\n can display job status or specific job attributes for jobs that have that have left the CE\u2019s queue. To list jobs that have run on the CE:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_history -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect the full ClassAd for a specific job, specify the \n-l\n flag and the job ID:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_history -name condorce.example.com -pool condorce.example.com:9619 -l \nJob ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you run the \ncondor_ce_history\n command on the CE that you are testing, omit the \n-name\n and \n-pool\n options. \ncondor_ce_history\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_history\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nUse the \ncondor_ce_job_router_info\n command to help troubleshoot your routes and how jobs will match to them. \nTo see all of your routes (the output is long because it combines your routes with the\n\nJOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS\n configuration variable):\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_job_router_info -config\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see how the job router is handling a job that is currently in the CE\u2019s queue, analyze the output of \ncondor_ce_q\n\n(replace the \nJOB-ID\n with the job ID that you are interested in):\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_q -l \nJOB-ID\n \n|\n condor_ce_job_router_info -match-jobs -ignore-prior-routing -jobads -\n\n\n\n\n\nTo inspect a job that has already left the queue, use \ncondor_ce_history\n instead of \ncondor_ce_q\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_history -l \nJOB-ID\n \n|\n condor_ce_job_router_info -match-jobs -ignore-prior-routing -jobads -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the proxy for the job has expired, the job will not match any routes. To work around this constraint:\n\n\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_history -l \nJOB-ID\n \n|\n sed \ns/^\\(x509UserProxyExpiration\\) = .*/\\1 = `date +%s --date \n+1 sec\n`/\n \n|\n condor_ce_job_router_info -match-jobs -ignore-prior-routing -jobads -\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can provide a file containing a job\u2019s ClassAd as the input and edit attributes within that file:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_job_router_info -match-jobs -ignore-prior-routing -jobads \nJOBAD-FILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nIf the job does not match any route:\n You can identify this case when you see \n0 candidate jobs found\n in the \ncondor_job_router_info\n output. This message means that, when compared to your job\u2019s ClassAd, the Umbrella constraint does not evaluate to \ntrue\n. When troubleshooting, look at all of the expressions prior to the \ntarget.ProcId \n= 0\n expression, because it and everything following it is logic that the job router added so that routed jobs do not get routed again.\n\n\n\n\nIf your job matches more than one route:\n the tool will tell you by showing all matching routes after the job ID:\n\n\nChecking Job src=162,0 against all routes\nRoute Matches: Local_PBS\nRoute Matches: Condor_Test\n\n\n\n\n\nTo troubleshoot why this is occuring, look at the combined Requirements expressions for all routes and compare it to the job\u2019s ClassAd provided. The combined Requirements expression is highlighted below:\n\n\nUmbrella constraint: ((target.x509userproxysubject =!= UNDEFINED) \n\n(target.x509UserProxyExpiration =!= UNDEFINED) \n\n(time() \n target.x509UserProxyExpiration) \n\n(target.JobUniverse =?= 5 || target.JobUniverse =?= 1)) \n\n\n( (target.osgTestPBS is true) || (true) ) \n\n\n(target.ProcId \n= 0 \n target.JobStatus == 1 \n\n(target.StageInStart is undefined || target.StageInFinish isnt undefined) \n\ntarget.Managed isnt \nScheddDone\n \n\ntarget.Managed isnt \nExtenal\n \n\ntarget.Owner isnt Undefined \n\ntarget.RoutedBy isnt \nhtcondor-ce\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth routes evaluate to \ntrue\n for the job\u2019s ClassAd because it contained \nosgTestPBS = true\n. Make sure your routes are mutually exclusive, otherwise you may have jobs routed incorrectly! See the \njob route configuration page\n for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it is unclear why jobs are matching a route:\n wrap the route's requirements expression in \ndebug()\n and check the \nJobRouterLog\n for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_router_q\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nIf you have multiple job routes and many jobs, \ncondor_ce_router_q\n is a useful tool to see how jobs are being routed\nand their statuses:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_router_q\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_router_q\n takes the same options as \ncondor_router_q\n and \ncondor_q\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor\nmanual\n\n\ncondor_ce_status\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo see the daemons running on a CE, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_status -any\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_status\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_status\n, which are documented in the\n\nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\n\n\n\"Missing\" Worker Nodes\n\n\nAn HTCondor-CE will not show any worker nodes (e.g. \nMachine\n entries in the \ncondor_ce_status -any\n output) if\nit does not have any running GlideinWMS pilot jobs.\nThis is expected since HTCondor-CE only forwards incoming grid jobs to your batch system and does not match jobs to\nworker nodes.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf the output of \ncondor_ce_status -any\n does not show at least the following daemons:\n\n\n\n\nCollector\n\n\nScheduler\n\n\nDaemonMaster\n\n\nJob_Router\n\n\n\n\nIncrease the \ndebug level\n and consult the\n\nHTCondor-CE logs\n for errors.\n\n\ncondor_ce_config_val\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo see the value of configuration variables and where they are set, use \ncondor_ce_config_val\n. \nPrimarily, This tool is used with the other troubleshooting tools to make sure your configuration is set properly. \nTo see the value of a single variable and where it is set:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val -v \nCONFIGURATION-VARIABLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see a list of all configuration variables and their values:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val -dump\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see a list of all the files that are used to create your configuration and the order that they are parsed, use the\nfollowing command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_config_val -config\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_config_val\n takes the same arguments as \ncondor_config_val\n and is documented in the \nHTCondor manual\n.\n\n\ncondor_ce_reconfig\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo ensure that your configuration changes have taken effect, run \ncondor_ce_reconfig\n.\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_{on,off,restart}\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo turn on/off/restart HTCondor-CE daemons, use the following commands:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_on\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_off\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_restart\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE service uses the previous commands with default values. \nUsing these commands directly gives you more fine-grained control over the behavior of HTCondor-CE's on/off/restart:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have installed a new version of HTCondor-CE and want to restart the CE under the new version, run the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_restart -fast\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will cause HTCondor-CE to restart and quickly reconnect to all running jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to stop running new jobs, run the following:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_ce_off -peaceful\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will cause HTCondor-CE to accept new jobs without starting them and will wait for currently running jobs to complete before shutting down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE Troubleshooting Data\n\n\nThe following files are located on the CE host.\n\n\nMasterLog\n\n\nThe HTCondor-CE master log tracks status of all of the other HTCondor daemons and thus contains valuable information if\nthey fail to start.\n\n\n\n\nLocation: \n/var/log/condor-ce/MasterLog\n\n\nKey

            "text": "Submitting Jobs to an HTCondor-CE\n\n\nThis document outlines methods of manual submission to an HTCondor-CE. It is intended for site administrators wishing to verify the functionality of their HTCondor-CE installation and developers writing software to submit jobs to an HTCondor-CE (e.g., pilot jobs).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nMost incoming jobs are pilots from factories and that manual submission does not reflect the standard method that jobs are submitted to OSG CE\u2019s.\n\n\n\n\nSubmitting Jobs...\n\n\nThere are two main methods for submitting files to an HTCondor-CE: using the tools bundled with the \nhtcondor-ce-client\n package and using the \ncondor_submit\n command with a submit file. Both methods will test end-to-end job submission but the former method is simpler while the latter will walk you through writing your own submit file.\n\n\nBefore attempting to submit jobs, you will need to generate a proxy from a user certificate before running any jobs. To generate a proxy, run the following command on the host you plan on submitting from:\n\n\nuser@host $\n voms-proxy-init\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing HTCondor-CE tools\n\n\nThere are two HTCondor-CE tools that allow users to test the functionality of their HTCondor-CE: \ncondor_ce_trace\n and \ncondor_ce_run\n. The former is the preferred tool as it provides useful feedback if failure occurs while the latter is simply an automated submission tool. These commands may be run from any host that has \nhtcondor-ce-client\n installed, which you may wish to do if you are testing availability of your CE from an external source.\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n is a Python script that uses HTCondor's Python bindings to run diagnostics, including job submission, against your HTCondor-CE. To submit a job with \ncondor_ce_trace\n, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_trace --debug condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE you wish to test. On success, you will see \nJob status: Completed\n and the environment of the job on the worker node it landed on. If you do not get the expected output, refer to the \ntroubleshooting guide\n.\n\n\nRequesting resources\n\n\ncondor_ce_trace\n doesn't make any specific resource requests so its jobs are only given the default resources by the CE. To request specific resources (or other job attributes), you can specify the \n--attribute\n option on the command line:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_trace --debug --attribute\n=\n+resource1=value1\n...--attribute\n=\n+resourceN=valueN\n condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nTo submit a job that requests 4 cores, 4 GB of RAM, a wall clock time of 2 hours, and the 'osg' queue, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_trace --debug --attribute\n=\n+xcount=4\n --attribute\n=\n+maxMemory=4000\n --attribute\n=\n+maxWallTime=120\n --attribute\n=\n+remote_queue=osg\n condorce.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a list of other attributes that can be set with the \n--attribute\n option, consult the \njob attributes\n section.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNon HTCondor batch systems may need additional configuration to support these job attributes.  See the \njob router recipes\n for details on how to support them.\n\n\n\n\ncondor_ce_run\n\n\ncondor_ce_run\n is a Python script that calls \ncondor_submit\n on a generated submit file and tracks its progress with \ncondor_q\n. To submit a job with \ncondor_ce_run\n, run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_run -r condorce.example.com:9619 /bin/env\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ncondorce.example.com\n with the hostname of the CE you wish to test. The command will not return any output until it completes: When it does you will see the environment of the job on the worker noded it landed on. If you do not get the expected output, refer to the \ntroubleshooting guide\n.\n\n\nUsing a submit file...\n\n\nIf you are familiar with HTCondor, submitting a job to an HTCondor-CE using a submit file follows the same procedure as submitting a job to an HTCondor batch system: Write a submit file and use \ncondor_submit\n (or in one of our cases, \ncondor_ce_submit\n) to submit the job. This is by virtue of the fact that HTCondor-CE is just a special configuration of HTCondor. The major differences occur in the specific attributes for the submit files outlined below.\n\n\nFrom the CE host\n\n\nThis method uses \ncondor_ce_submit\n to submit directly to an HTCondor-CE. The only reason we use \ncondor_ce_submit\n in this case is to take advantage of the already running daemons on the CE host.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a submit file, \nce_test.sub\n:\n\n\n# Required for local HTCondor-CE submission\nuniverse = vanilla\nuse_x509userproxy = true\n+Owner = undefined\n\n# Files\nexecutable = ce_test.sh\noutput = ce_test.out\nerror = ce_test.err\n\nlog = ce_test.log\n\n\n# File transfer behavior\nShouldTransferFiles = YES\nWhenToTransferOutput = ON_EXIT\n\n# Optional resource requests\n#+xcount = 4            # Request 4 cores\n#+maxMemory = 4000      # Request 4GB of RAM\n#+maxWallTime = 120     # Request 2 hrs of wall clock time\n#+remote_queue = \nosg\n  # Request the OSG queue\n\n# Run job once\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \nce_test.sh\n with the path to the executable you wish to run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use any executable you choose for the \nexecutable\n field. If you don't have one in mind, you may use the following example test script:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\ndate\nhostname\nenv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark the test script as executable:\n\n\nuser@host $\n chmod +x ce_test.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_submit ce_test.sub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom another host\n\n\nFor this method, you will need a functional HTCondor submit node. If you do not have one readily available, you can install the \ncondor\n package from the OSG repository to get a simple submit node:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall HTCondor:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the \ncondor\n service:\n\n\nroot@host $\n service condor start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the \ncondor\n service is running, write a submit file and submit your job:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a submit file, \nce_test.sub\n:\n\n\n# Required for remote HTCondor-CE submission\nuniverse = grid\nuse_x509userproxy = true\n\ngrid_resource = condor condorce.example.com condorce.example.com:9619\n\n\n# Files\n\nexecutable = ce_test.sh\n\noutput = ce_test.out\nerror = ce_test.err\nlog = ce_test.log\n\n# File transfer behavior\nShouldTransferFiles = YES\nWhenToTransferOutput = ON_EXIT\n\n# Optional resource requests\n#+xcount = 4            # Request 4 cores\n#+maxMemory = 4000      # Request 4GB of RAM\n#+maxWallTime = 120     # Request 2 hrs of wall clock time\n#+remote_queue = \nosg\n  # Request the OSG queue\n\n# Run job once\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \ngrid_resource\n line should start with \ncondor\n and is not related to which batch system you are using.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use any executable you choose for the \nexecutable\n field. If you don't have one in mind, you may use the following example test script:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\ndate\nhostname\nenv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark the test script as executable:\n\n\nuser@host $\n chmod +x ce_test.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_submit ce_test.sub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking job progress\n\n\nWhen the job completes, stdout will be placed into \nce_test.out\n, stderr will be placed into \nce_test.err\n, and HTCondor logging information will be placed in \nce_test.log\n. You can track job progress by looking at the condor queue by running the following command on the CE host:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_ce_q\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the following table to determine job status:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis value in the \nST\n column...\n\n\nMeans that the job is...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nidle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\ncomplete\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nbeing removed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\nheld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransferring input\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransferring output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Job Routes Affect Your Job\n\n\nUpon successful submission of your job, the Job Router takes control of your job by matching it to routes and submitting a transformed job to your batch system.\n\n\nMatching\n\n\nSee \nthis section\n for details on how jobs are matched\nto job routes.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nThe following three routes only perform filtering and submission of routed jobs to an HTCondor batch system. The only differences are in the types of jobs that they match:\n\n\n\n\nRoute 1:\n Matches jobs whose attribute \nfoo\n is equal to \nbar\n.\n\n\nRoute 2:\n Matches jobs whose attribute \nfoo\n is equal to \nbaz\n.\n\n\nRoute 3:\n Matches jobs whose attribute \nfoo\n is neither equal to \nbar\n nor \nbaz\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSetting a custom attribute for job submission requires the \n+\n prefix in your submit file but it is unnecessary in the job routes.\n\n\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nRoute 1\n; \\\n     Requirements = (TARGET.foo =?= \nbar\n); \\\n] \\\n[ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nRoute 2\n; \\\n     Requirements = (TARGET.foo =?= \nbaz\n); \\\n] \\\n[ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nRoute 3\n; \\\n     Requirements = (TARGET.foo =!= \nbar\n) \n (TARGET.foo =!= \nbaz\n); \\\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a user submitted their job with \n+foo = bar\n in their submit file, the job would match \nRoute 1\n.\n\n\nRoute defaults\n\n\nRoute defaults\n can be set for batch system queue, maximum memory, number of cores to request, and maximum walltime. The submitting user can override any of these by setting the corresponding \nattribute\n in their job.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nThe following route takes all incoming jobs and submits them to an HTCondor batch system requesting 1GB of memory.\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = [ \\\n     TargetUniverse = 5; \\\n     name = \nRoute 1\n; \\\n     set_default_maxMemory = 1000; \\\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nA user could submit their job with the attribute \n+maxMemory=2000\n and that job would be submitted requesting 2GB memory instead of the default of 1GB.\n\n\nTroubleshooting Your Jobs\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nAll interactions between \ncondor_submit\n and the CE will be recorded in the file specified by the \nlog\n attribute in your submit file.

If you already provide resources through an OSG Hosted CE, skip to  this section .    Enable the OSG VO  on your HTCondor-CE.  Setup a job route specific to COVID-19 pilot jobs (documented below).\n   The job route will allow you to prioritize these jobs using local policy in your site's cluster.

Follow the section that is appropriate for your host's OS:\n\n\n\n\nFor EL6 hosts\n\n\nFor EL7 hosts\n\n\n\n\nFor EL6 hosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf automount is not yet in use on the system, do the following:\n\n\nroot@host #\n chkconfig autofs on\n\nroot@host #\n service autofs start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate or edit \n/etc/auto.master\n to have the following contents:\n\n\n/cvmfs /etc/auto.cvmfs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart autofs to make the change take effect:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service autofs restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor EL7 hosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf automount is not yet in use on the system, do the following:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl \nenable\n autofs\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start autofs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the following in \n/etc/auto.master.d/cvmfs.autofs\n:\n\n\n/cvmfs /etc/auto.cvmfs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart autofs to make the change take effect:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl restart autofs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring CVMFS\n\n\nCreate or edit \n/etc/cvmfs/default.local\n, a file that controls the\nCVMFS configuration. Below is a sample configuration, but please note\nthat you will need to \nedit the parts in angle brackets\n. In\nparticular, the \nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY\n line below must be edited for your\nsite.\n\n\nCVMFS_REPOSITORIES=\n`echo $((echo oasis.opensciencegrid.org;echo cms.cern.ch;ls /cvmfs)|sort -u)|tr \n \n ,`\n\nCVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT=\nQUOTA LIMIT\n\nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=\nSQUID URL\n:\nSQUID PORT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCVMFS by default allows any repository to be mounted, no matter what\nthe setting of \nCVMFS_REPOSITORIES\n is; that variable is used by support\ntools such as \ncvmfs_config\n and \ncvmfs_talk\n when they need to know a\nlist of repositories.  The recommended \nCVMFS_REPOSITORIES\n setting\nabove is so that those tools will use two common repositories plus any\nadditional that have been mounted.  You may want to choose a different\nset of always-known repositories.\n\n\nSet up a list of CVMFS HTTP proxies to retrieve from in\n\nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY\n. If you do not have any squid at your site follow\nthe instructions to \ninstall squid from OSG\n.\nVertical bars separating proxies means to load balance between them\nand try them all before continuing. A semicolon between proxies means\nto try that one only after the previous ones have failed. For example:\n\n\nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=\nhttp://squid1.example.com:3128|http://squid2.example.com:3128;http://backup-squid.example.com:3128\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no squid is available, it is acceptable for very small sites and\nlaptops to set \nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=\"DIRECT\"\n.  In that case, the OSG\nconfiguration sets the servers to be contacted through\n\nglobally distributed caches\n.\nThis is strongly discouraged for large sites because of the performance\nimpact and because of the potential impact on the global caches.  When\nthere is at least one local proxy defined, the OSG configuration instead\nadds fallback proxies at Fermilab and CERN.  Those fallback proxies are\nmonitored by a WLCG team that will contact your site when your local\nproxy is failing and help you fix it.\n\n\nSet up the cache limit in \nCVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT\n (in Megabytes). The\nrecommended value for most applications is \n20000\n MB. This is the\ncombined limit for all but the osgstorage.org repositories. This cache\nwill be stored in \n/var/lib/cvmfs\n by default; to override the\nlocation, set \nCVMFS_CACHE_BASE\n in \n/etc/cvmfs/default.local\n. Note\nthat an additional 1000 MB is allocated for a separate osgstorage.org\nrepositories cache in \n$CVMFS_CACHE_BASE/osgstorage\n. To be safe, make\nsure that at least 20% more than \n$CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT\n + 1000 MB of space\nstays available for CVMFS in that filesystem. This is very important,\nsince if that space is not available it can cause many I/O errors and\napplication crashes. Many system administrators choose to put the\ncache space in a separate filesystem, which is a good way to manage\nit.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you use SELinux and change \nCVMFS_CACHE_BASE\n, then the\nnew cache directory must be labeled with SELinux type\n\ncvmfs_cache_t\n. This can be done by executing the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n chcon -R -t cvmfs_cache_t \nCVMFS_CACHE_BASE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidating CVMFS\n\n\nAfter CVMFS is installed, you should be able to see the \n/cvmfs\n\ndirectory. But note that it will initially appear to be empty:\n\n\nuser@host $\n ls /cvmfs\n\nuser@host $\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectories within \n/cvmfs\n will not be mounted until you examine them.

If this works, then CVMFS is working, but there is a\n  problem with automount.\n\n\nIf that doesn't work and doesn't give any explanatory errors, try\n   \ncvmfs_config chksetup\n or \ncvmfs_config showconfig REPOSITORYNAME\n\n   to verify your setup.\n\n\nIf chksetup reports access problems to proxies, it may be caused by\n  access control settings in the squids.\n\n\nIf you have changed settings in \n/etc/cvmfs/default.local\n, and they\n  do not seem to be taking effect, note that there are other\n  configuration files that can override the settings. See the comments\n  at the beginning of \n/etc/cvmfs/default.conf\n regarding the order in\n  which configuration files are evaluated and look for old files that\n  may have been left from a previous installation.\n\n\nMore things to try are in the\n  \nupstream documentation\n.\n\n\n\n\nStarting and Stopping services\n\n\nOnce it is set up, CVMFS is always automatically started when one of\nthe repositories are accessed; there are no system services to start.\n\n\nCVMFS can be stopped via:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_config umount\n\nUnmounting /cvmfs/config-osg.opensciencegrid.org: OK\n\n\nUnmounting /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch: OK\n\n\nUnmounting /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org: OK\n\n\nUnmounting /cvmfs/glast.egi.eu: OK\n\n\nUnmounting /cvmfs/nova.osgstorage.org: OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get Help?\n\n\nIf you cannot resolve the problem, there are several ways to receive help:\n\n\n\n\nFor bug reporting and OSG-specific issues, see our \nhelp procedure\n\n\nFor community support and best-effort software team support contact\n   \n.\n\n\nFor general CernVM File System support contact \n.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nhttp://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem/techinformation\n\n\nhttps://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n\n\n\nUsers and Groups\n\n\nThis installation will create one user unless it already exists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncvmfs\n\n\nCernVM-FS service account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe installation will also create a cvmfs group and default the cvmfs\nuser to that group.

Below is a sample configuration, but please note\nthat you will need to  edit the parts in angle brackets . In\nparticular, the  CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY  line below must be edited for your\nsite.  CVMFS_REPOSITORIES= `echo $((echo oasis.opensciencegrid.org;echo cms.cern.ch;ls /cvmfs)|sort -u)|tr     ,` \nCVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT= QUOTA LIMIT \nCVMFS_HTTP_PROXY= SQUID URL : SQUID PORT   CVMFS by default allows any repository to be mounted, no matter what\nthe setting of  CVMFS_REPOSITORIES  is; that variable is used by support\ntools such as  cvmfs_config  and  cvmfs_talk  when they need to know a\nlist of repositories.  The recommended  CVMFS_REPOSITORIES  setting\nabove is so that those tools will use two common repositories plus any\nadditional that have been mounted.  You may want to choose a different\nset of always-known repositories.  Set up a list of CVMFS HTTP proxies to retrieve from in CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY . If you do not have any squid at your site follow\nthe instructions to  install squid from OSG .\nVertical bars separating proxies means to load balance between them\nand try them all before continuing. A semicolon between proxies means\nto try that one only after the previous ones have failed. For example:  CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY= http://squid1.example.com:3128|http://squid2.example.com:3128;http://backup-squid.example.com:3128   If no squid is available, it is acceptable for very small sites and\nlaptops to set  CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=\"DIRECT\" .  In that case, the OSG\nconfiguration sets the servers to be contacted through globally distributed caches .\nThis is strongly discouraged for large sites because of the performance\nimpact and because of the potential impact on the global caches.  When\nthere is at least one local proxy defined, the OSG configuration instead\nadds fallback proxies at Fermilab and CERN.  Those fallback proxies are\nmonitored by a WLCG team that will contact your site when your local\nproxy is failing and help you fix it.  Set up the cache limit in  CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT  (in Megabytes). The\nrecommended value for most applications is  20000  MB. This is the\ncombined limit for all but the osgstorage.org repositories. This cache\nwill be stored in  /var/lib/cvmfs  by default; to override the\nlocation, set  CVMFS_CACHE_BASE  in  /etc/cvmfs/default.local . Note\nthat an additional 1000 MB is allocated for a separate osgstorage.org\nrepositories cache in  $CVMFS_CACHE_BASE/osgstorage . To be safe, make\nsure that at least 20% more than  $CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT  + 1000 MB of space\nstays available for CVMFS in that filesystem. This is very important,\nsince if that space is not available it can cause many I/O errors and\napplication crashes. Many system administrators choose to put the\ncache space in a separate filesystem, which is a good way to manage\nit.   Warning  If you use SELinux and change  CVMFS_CACHE_BASE , then the\nnew cache directory must be labeled with SELinux type cvmfs_cache_t . This can be done by executing the following command:  user@host $  chcon -R -t cvmfs_cache_t  CVMFS_CACHE_BASE",

OSG recommends that system administrators\nenable unprivileged singularity on RHEL 7.x worker nodes and not install the\nsingularity RPM when possible.  Sites that do install the RPM may choose to\nconfigure their RHEL 7.x RPM installations to run unprivileged.  RHEL\n6.x installations have no option for unprivileged singularity so there\nthe RPM has to be installed and left configured as privileged.\n\n\nIn addition to improved security, unprivileged singularity enables\n\ncondor_ssh_to_job\n to enter a container namespace without itself\nneeding privileges. \n\n\nOn the other hand, there are a few rare use cases that require\nsingularity to run privileged:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing single-file container images.\n  Some systems, especially\n    High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, deal poorly with\n    collections of small files.  In this case, container images stored\n    in a single file (as opposed to an unpacked directory) may be\n    needed.\n\n\nHowever, OSG VO container images are usually directory-based in\nCVMFS, and when possible we \nrecommend disabling this\nfeature\n on privileged installations in order\nto avoid potential kernel exploits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overlay feature.\n  The \"overlay\" feature of singularity uses\n    overlayfs to add bind mounts where mount points don't exist in the\n    underlying image.\n\n\nHowever, this feature doesn't work if the image is a directory\ndistributed in CVMFS, singularity has an \"underlay\" feature that is\nequivalent which does work with CVMFS and does not require\nprivileges, and the overlay feature has been a source of security\nvulnerabilities in the past.  For these reasons, \nwe recommend\nreplacing overlay with underlay\n even on\nprivileged installations.  \n\n\noverlayfs is also used to make the appearance of writable images\nwhen building containers, so it may be needed on some systems for\nthat purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling Unprivileged Singularity\n\n\nThe instructions in this section are for enabling singularity to run\nunprivileged.\n\n\nIf the operating system is an EL 7 variant and has been updated to the EL\n7.6 kernel or later, enable unprivileged singularity with the following\nsteps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable user namespaces via \nsysctl\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n \nuser.max_user_namespaces = 15000\n \n\\\n\n    \n /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_user_namespaces.conf\n\nroot@host #\n sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_user_namespaces.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) Disable network namespaces:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n \nuser.max_net_namespaces = 0\n \n\\\n\n    \n /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_net_namespaces.conf\n\nroot@host #\n sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_net_namespaces.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG VOs do not need network namespaces with singularity, and\ndisabling them reduces the risk profile of enabling user\nnamespaces.\n\n\nNetwork namespaces are, however, utilized by other software,\nsuch as Docker.  Disabling network namespaces may break other\nsoftware, or limit its capabilities (such as requiring the\n\n--net=host\n option in Docker).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf docker is being used to run jobs, the following options are \n    recommended to allow unprivileged singularity to run (it does not\n    need \n--privileged\n or any added capabilities):\n\n\n--security-opt seccomp=unconfined --security-opt systempaths=unconfined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first option enables unshare to be called (which is needed to\ncreate namespaces), and the second option allows /proc to be mounted\nin an unprivileged process namespace (as done by singularity exec -p).\nThe options are secure as long as the system administrator controls\nthe images and does not allow user code to run as root, and are\ngenerally more secure than adding capabilities.  If at this point no\nsetuid programs needs to be run within the container, adding the\nfollowing option will add security by preventing any privilege\nescalation (singularity uses the same feature on its containers):\n\n\n--security-opt no-new-privileges\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the following option is recommended for allowing\nunprivileged fuse mounts on kernels that support that (RHEL \n= 7.8):\n\n\n--device=/dev/fuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Unprivileged Singularity\n\n\nWhen unprivileged singularity is enabled and VOs run singularity from\nCVMFS, the singularity configuration file also comes from CVMFS so local\nsites have no control over changing the configuration.  However, the\nmost common local configuration change to the singularity RPM is to add\nadditional local \"bind path\" options to map extra local file paths into\ncontainers.  This can instead be accomplished by setting the\n\nSINGULARITY_BINDPATH\n variable in the environment of jobs, for\nexample through\n\nconfiguration\n\non your compute element.  This is a\ncomma-separated list of paths to bind, following the syntax of the\n\nsingularity exec --bind\n option.\n\n\nThere are also other environment variables that can affect singularity\noperation; see the\n\nsingularity documentation\n\nfor details.\n\n\nValidating Unprivileged Singularity\n\n\nIf you haven't yet installed \nCVMFS\n, please do so.\nAlternatively, use the\n\ncvmfsexec package\n\nconfigured for osg as an unprivileged user and mount the\noasis.opensciencegrid.org and singularity.opensciencegrid.org\nrepositories.\n\n\nAs an unprivileged user verify that singularity in OASIS works with this\ncommand:\n\n\nuser@host $\n /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/singularity/bin/singularity \n\\\n\n                \nexec\n --contain --ipc --pid --bind /cvmfs \n\\\n\n                /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/osgvo-el6:latest \n\\\n\n                ps -ef\n\nUID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD\n\n\nuser         1     0  2 21:27 ?        00:00:00 shim-init\n\n\nuser         2     1  0 21:27 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingularity via RPM\n\n\nThe instructions in this section are for the singularity RPM, which \nincludes setuid-root executables.  The setuid-root executables can\nhowever be disabled by configuration, details below.\n\n\nInstalling Singularity via RPM\n\n\nTo install the singularity RPM, make sure that your host is up to date\nbefore installing the required packages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will update \nall\n packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Singularity\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install singularity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Singularity RPM\n\n\nsingularity includes an option called \nunderlay\n that enables using bind\nmount points that do not exist in the container image.\nBy default it is enabled, but only if the similar \noverlay\n option cannot\nbe used, such as on RHEL6 where kernel support for overlayfs is missing\nor when running in unprivileged mode.  On RHEL7 it is recommended to\ncompletely disable \noverlay\n, because it is more vulnerable to security\nproblems than \nunderlay\n and because it does not work correctly when\ncontainer images are distributed by CVMFS.\n\n\nSet this option in \n/etc/singularity/singularity.conf\n:\n\n\n    enable overlay = no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you modify \n/etc/singularity/singularity.conf\n, be careful with\nyour upgrade procedures.\nRPM will not automatically merge your changes with new upstream\nconfiguration keys, which may cause a broken install or inadvertently\nchange the site configuration.  Singularity changes its default\nconfiguration file more frequently than typical OSG software.\n\n\nLook for \nsingularity.conf.rpmnew\n after upgrades and merge in any\nchanges to the defaults.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the RPM to be Unprivileged\n\n\nIf you choose to run the RPM unprivileged, after\n\nenabling unprivileged singularity\n,\nchange the line in \n/etc/singularity/singularity.conf\n that says\n\nallow setuid = yes\n to\n\n\n    allow setuid = no\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the setuid-root executables stay installed, but they will exit\nvery early if invoked when the configuration file disallows setuid, so\nthe risk is very low.  There are non-setuid equivalent executables that\nare used instead when setuid is disallowed.\n\n\nLimiting Image Types\n\n\nA side effect of disabling privileged singularity is that loopback\nmounts are disallowed.  If the installation is privileged, also consider\nthe following.\n\n\nImages based on loopback devices carry an inherently higher exposure to\nunknown kernel exploits compared to directory-based images distributed via\nCVMFS.  See \nthis article\n for further\ndiscussion.\n\n\nThe loopback-based images are the default image type produced by singularity\nusers and are common at sites with direct user logins.  However (as of April\n2019) we are only aware of directory-based images being used by OSG VOs.\nHence, it is reasonable to disable the loopback-based images by setting\nthe following option in \n/etc/singularity/singularity.conf\n:\n\n\n    max loop devices = 0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile reasonable for some sites, this is not required as there are currently\nno public kernel exploits for this issue; any exploits are patched by\nRed Hat when they are discovered.\n\n\nValidating Singularity RPM\n\n\nAfter singularity is installed, as an ordinary user run the following\ncommand to verify it:\n\n\nuser@host $\n singularity \nexec\n --contain --ipc --pid --bind /cvmfs \n\\\n\n                /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/osgvo-el6:latest \n\\\n\n                ps -ef\n\nWARNING: Container does not have an exec helper script, calling \nps\n directly\n\n\nUID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD\n\n\nuser         1     0  1 21:41 ?        00:00:00 shim-init\n\n\nuser         2     1  0 21:41 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting and Stopping Services\n\n\nsingularity has no services to start or stop.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nSingularity Documentation\n\n\nSingularity Support\n\n\nAdditional guidance for CMS sites",

If at this point no\nsetuid programs needs to be run within the container, adding the\nfollowing option will add security by preventing any privilege\nescalation (singularity uses the same feature on its containers):  --security-opt no-new-privileges   In addition, the following option is recommended for allowing\nunprivileged fuse mounts on kernels that support that (RHEL  = 7.8):  --device=/dev/fuse",

We\nencourage all sites to configure and use this service, as described\nbelow.\n\n\nFor large sites that expect heavy load on the proxy, it is best to run the proxy on its own host.\nIf you are unsure if your site qualifies, we recommend initially running the proxy on your CE host and monitoring its\nbandwidth.\nIf the network usage regularly peaks at over one third of the bandwidth capacity, move the proxy to a new host.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If it does not exist already, the installation will create the \nsquid\n Linux user\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n Frontier squid communicates on ports 3128 (TCP) and 3401 (UDP)\n\n\nHost choice:\n If you will be supporting the Frontier application at your site, review the\n\nupstream documentation\n to determine how to size your equipment.\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Frontier Squid\n\n\nTo install Frontier Squid, make sure that your host is up to date before installing the required packages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will update \nall\n packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Frontier Squid:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install frontier-squid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Frontier Squid\n\n\nConfiguring the Frontier Squid Service\n\n\nTo configure the Frontier Squid service itself:\n\n\n\n\nFollow the\n    \nConfiguration section of the upstream Frontier Squid documentation\n.\n\n\nEnable, start, and test the service (as described below).\n\n\nRegister the squid (also as described \nbelow\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAn important difference between the standard Squid software and\nthe Frontier Squid variant is that Frontier Squid changes are in\n\n/etc/squid/customize.sh\n instead of \n/etc/squid/squid.conf\n.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the OSG CE\n\n\nTo configure the OSG Compute Element (CE) to know about your Frontier Squid service:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn your CE host (which may be different than your Frontier Squid host), edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/01-squid.ini\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that \nenabled\n is set to \nTrue\n\n\nSet \nlocation\n to the hostname and port of your Frontier Squid\n    service (e.g., \nmy.squid.host.edu:3128\n)\n\n\nLeave the other settings at \nDEFAULT\n unless you have specific\n    reasons to change them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \nosg-configure -c\n to propagate the changes on your CE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou may want to finish other CE configuration tasks before running\n\nosg-configure\n. Just be sure to run it once before starting CE\nservices.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Frontier-Squid\n\n\nStart the frontier-squid service and enable it to start at boot time. As a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as \nroot\n):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo...\n\n\nOn EL6, run the command...\n\n\nOn EL7, run the command...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a service\n\n\nservice frontier-squid start\n\n\nsystemctl start frontier-squid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop a  service\n\n\nservice frontier-squid stop\n\n\nsystemctl stop frontier-squid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable a service to start on boot\n\n\nchkconfig frontier-squid on\n\n\nsystemctl enable frontier-squid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable a service from starting on boot\n\n\nchkconfig frontier-squid off\n\n\nsystemctl disable frontier-squid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidating Frontier Squid\n\n\nAs any user on another computer, do the following (where\n\nMY.SQUID.HOST.EDU\n is the fully qualified domain name of your\nsquid server):\n\n\nuser@host $\n \nexport\n \nhttp_proxy\n=\nhttp://\n`\nMY.SQUID.HOST.EDU\n`\n:3128\n\nuser@host $\n wget -qdO/dev/null http://frontier.cern.ch \n2\n1\n|\ngrep X-Cache\n\nX-Cache: MISS from `\nMY.SQUID.HOST.EDU\n`\n\n\nuser@host $\n wget -qdO/dev/null http://frontier.cern.ch \n2\n1\n|\ngrep X-Cache\n\nX-Cache: HIT from `\nMY.SQUID.HOST.EDU\n`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the grep doesn't print anything, try removing it from the pipeline\nto see if errors are obvious. If the second try says MISS again,\nsomething is probably wrong with the squid cache writes. Look at the squid\n\naccess.log file\n\nto try to see what's wrong.\n\n\nIf your squid will be supporting the Frontier application, it is also\ngood to do the test in the\n\nupstream documentation Testing the installation section\n.\n\n\nRegistering Frontier Squid\n\n\nTo register your Frontier Squid host, follow the general registration instructions\n\nhere\n with the following Frontier Squid-specific details:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a \nSquid:\n section to the \nServices:\n list, with any relevant fields for that service.\n    This is a partial example:\n\n\n...\n\n\nFQDN: \nFULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME\n\n\nServices:\n\n\n  Squid:\n\n\n    Description: Generic squid service\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \nFULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME\n with your Frontier Squid server's DNS entry or in the case of multiple\nFrontier Squid servers for a single resource, the round-robin DNS entry.\n\n\nSee the \nBNL_ATLAS_Frontier_Squid\n \nfor a complete example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are setting up a new resource, set \nActive: false\n.\n    Only set \nActive: true\n for a resource when it is accepting requests and ready for production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally registered squids will be monitored by WLCG.  This is\nstrongly recommended even for non-WLCG sites so operations experts can\nhelp with diagnosing problems.  However, if a site declines\nmonitoring, that can be indicated by setting \nMonitored: false\n in a\n\nDetails:\n section below \nDescription:\n.  Registration is still\nimportant for the sake of excluding squids from worker node failover\nmonitors.  The default if \nDetails:\n \nMonitored:\n is not set is\n\ntrue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set Monitored to true, also enable monitoring as described in \nthe \nupstream documentation on enabling monitoring\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few hours after a squid is registered and marked \nActive\n (and not\nmarked \nMonitored: false\n), \n\nverify that it is monitored by WLCG\n.\n\n\nReference\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nThe frontier-squid installation will create one user account unless it\nalready exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsquid\n\n\nReduced privilege user that the squid process runs under.

Once software is installed into\nan OASIS repository, the goal is to make it available across about 90% of the OSG within an hour.\n\n\nOASIS consists of keysigning infrastructure, a content distribution network (CDN), and a shared CVMFS repository that\nis hosted by the OSG.  Many use cases will be covered by utilizing the \nshared repository\n; this document\ncovers how to install, configure, and host your own CVMFS \nrepository server\n.  This server will distribute software\nvia OASIS, but will be hosted and operated externally from the OSG project.\n\n\nOASIS-based distribution and key signing is available to OSG VOs or repositories affiliated with an OSG VO.\nSee the \npolicy page\n for more information\non what repositories OSG is willing to distribute.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nCVMFS repositories work at the kernel filesystem layer, which adds more stringent host requirements than a typical\nOSG install.  The host OS must meet ONE of the following:\n\n\n\n\nRHEL 7.3 (or equivalent) or later.  \nThis option is recommended\n.\n\n\nRHEL 6 with the aufs kernel module.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally,\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If it does not exist already, the installation will create the \ncvmfs\n Linux user\n\n\nGroup IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux groups \ncvmfs\n and \nfuse\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n This page will configure the repository to distribute using Apache HTTPD on port 8000.  At the\n    minimum, the repository needs in-bound access from the OASIS CDN.\n\n\nDisk space:\n This host will need enough free disk space to host \ntwo\n copies of the software: one compressed\n    and one uncompressed. \n/srv/cvmfs\n will hold all the published data (compressed and de-deuplicated).  The\n    \n/var/spool/cvmfs\n directory will contain all the data in all current transactions (uncompressed).\n\n\nRoot access\n will be needed to install.  Software install will be done as an unprivileged user.\n\n\nYum\n will need to be \nconfigured to use the OSG repositories\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverlay-FS limitations\n\n\nCVMFS on RHEL7 only supports Overlay-FS if the underlying filesystem is \next3\n or \next4\n; make sure\n\n/var/spool/cvmfs\n is one of these filesystem types.\n\n\nIf this is not possible, add \nCVMFS_DONT_CHECK_OVERLAYFS_VERSION=yes\n to your CVMFS configuration.  Using\n\nxfs\n will work if it was created with \nftype=1\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nRHEL7-based Systems\n\n\nFor a RHEL7-based system, installation is a straightforward install via \nyum\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install cvmfs-server osg-oasis \n\n\n\n\n\nRHEL6-based Systems\n\n\nA RHEL6 host needs additional steps in order to add the AUFS2 kernel module.\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -i https://cvmrepo.web.cern.ch/cvmrepo/yum/cvmfs-release-latest.noarch.rpm\n\nroot@host #\n yum install --enablerepo\n=\ncernvm-kernel --disablerepo\n=\ncernvm kernel aufs2-util cvmfs-server.x86_64 osg-oasis\n\nroot@host #\n reboot\n\n\n\n\n\nApache and Repository Mounts\n\n\nFor all installs, we recommend mounting all the local repositories on startup:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n \ncvmfs_server mount -a\n \n/etc/rc.local\n\nroot@host #\n chmod +x /etc/rc.local\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Apache HTTPD service should be configured to listen on port 8000, have the \nKeepAlive\n option enabled, and be\nstarted:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n Listen \n8000\n \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf \n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n KeepAlive on \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf \n\nroot@host #\n chkconfig httpd on \n\nroot@host #\n service httpd start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Firewalls\n\n\nMake sure that port 8000 is available to the Internet.

We have two specialized documents\nfor Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and XRootD based storage:\n\n\n\n\nInstall and configure a GridFTP server on top of HDFS.\n\n\nInstall and configure a GridFTP server on top of XRootD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process you will need to fulfill these prerequisites.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\nSSL Certificate: The GridFTP service uses a host certificate at \n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n and an accompanying key at \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\nNetwork ports: GridFTP listens on TCP port 2811 and the list of ports configured by the \nGLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE\n environment variable.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling GridFTP\n\n\nFirst, you will need to install the GridFTP meta-package:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-gridftp\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring GridFTP\n\n\nConfiguring authentication\n\n\nTo configure which virtual organizations and users are allowed to use your GridFTP server, follow the instructions in\n\nthe LCMAPS VOMS plugin document\n.\n\n\nSet port ranges\n\n\nAs mentioned above, GridFTP uses port 2811 for control communication as well as a range of ports for the data transfer.\nThis range of ports has to defined by setting the variable \nGLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE\n within the configuration file:\n\n/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server\n as it is shown in the next example.\nThis range has to be open within your firewall for inbound communication.\n\n\n$GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE 50000,51000\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional configuration\n\n\nSetting transfer limits for GridFTP-HDFS\n\n\nTo set a limit on the total or per-user number of transfers, create \n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n and set the following configuration:\n\n\nexport GRIDFTP_TRANSFER_LIMIT=\n80\n\nexport GRIDFTP_DEFAULT_USER_TRANSFER_LIMIT=\n50\n\n\nexport GRIDFTP_\nUNIX USERNAME\n_USER_TRANSFER_LIMIT=\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above configuration:\n\n\n\n\nThere would be no more than 80 transfers going at a time, across all users.\n\n\nBy default, any single user can have no more than 50 transfers at a time.\n\n\nThe \nUNIX USERNAME\n user has a more stringent limit of 40 transfers at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis limits are per gridftp server. If you have several gridftp servers you may want to have this limits divided by the number of gridftp servers at your site.\n\n\n\n\nModifying the environment\n\n\nEnvironment variables are stored in \n/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server\n which is sourced on service startup.  If you want to change LCMAPS log levels, or GridFTP port ranges, you can edit them there.\n\n\n#Uncomment and modify for firewalls\n\n\n#export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=min,max\n\n\n#export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=min,max\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the variables \nGLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE\n and \nGLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE\n can be set here to allow GridFTP to navigate around firewall rules (these affect the inbound and outbound ports, respectively).\n\n\nTo troubleshoot LCMAPS authorization, you can add the following to \n/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server\n and choose a higher debug level:\n\n\n# level 0: no messages, 1: errors, 2: also warnings, 3: also notices,\n#  4: also info, 5: maximum debug\nLCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL=2\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput goes to \n/var/log/messages\n by default. Do not set logging to 5 on any production systems as that may cause systems to slow down significantly or become unresponsive.\n\n\nConfiguring a multi-homed server\n\n\nThe GridFTP uses control connections, data connections and IPC connections. By default it listens in all interfaces but this can be changed by editing the configuration file \n/etc/gridftp.conf\n.\n\n\nTo use a single interface you can set \nhostname\n to the Hostname or IP address to use:\n\n\nhostname IP-TO-USE\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also set separately the \ncontrol_interface\n, \ndata_interface\n and \nipc_interface\n.  On systems that have multiple network interfaces, you may want to associate data transfers with the fastest possible NIC available. This can be done in the GridFTP server by setting \ndata_interface\n:\n\n\ncontrol_interface IP-TO-USE\ndata_interface IP-TO-USE\nipc_interface IP-TO-USE\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more options available for the GridFTP server, read the comments in the configuration file (\n/etc/gridftp.conf\n) or\nsee the \nGridFTP manual\n.\n\n\nMonitoring\n\n\nEnabling GridFTP transfer probe\n\n\nThe OSG monitoring of GridFTP is carried out by the GridFTP Gratia Probe which is installed by the package:\n\ngratia-probe-gridftp-transfer\n\nAssuming you installed GridFTP using the \nosg-gridftp\n or \nosg-se-hadoop-gridftp\n RPM, this package will\nalready be installed.\n\n\nHere are the most relevant file and directory locations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nNeeds Editing?\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbe Configuration\n\n\nYes\n\n\n/etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbe Executables\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/usr/share/gratia/gridftp-transfer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog files\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/var/log/gratia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporary files\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/var/lib/gratia/tmp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RPM installs the Gratia probe into the system crontab, but does not configure it. The configuration of the probe is controlled by the file\n\n\n/etc/gratia/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is usually one XML node spread over multiple lines. Note that comments (#) have no effect on this file. You will need to edit the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\n\n\nNeeds Editing\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbeName\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nThis should be set to \"gridftp-transfer:\nHOSTNAME\n\", where \nHOSTNAME\n is the fully-qualified domain name of your gridftp host.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollectorHost\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nSet to the hostname and port of the central collector.

There are usually two options:\n\n\n\n\nOSG Transfer Collector\n: This is the primary collector for transfers in the OSG. Use \nCollectorHost=\"gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80\"\n.\n\n\nOSG-ITB Transfer Collector\n: This is the test collector for transfers in the OSG. Use \nCollectorHost=\" gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80\"\n.\n\n\n\n\nManaging GridFTP\n\n\nIn addition to the GridFTP service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation. The specific services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch CRL\n\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n and \nfetch-crl-cron\n\n\nSee \nCA documentation\n for more info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGratia\n\n\ngratia-probes-cron\n\n\nAccounting software\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nglobus-gridftp-server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the services in the order listed and stop them in reverse order.

            "text": "Load Balancing GridFTP\n\n\nGridFTP is designed for high throughput data transfers and in many cases can handle all of the transfers for a site. However, in some cases it may be useful to run multiple GridFTP servers to distribute the load. For such sites, we recommend using a \nload balancer\n to distribute requests and present the appearance of a single high-throughput GridFTP server.\n\n\nOne general-purpose technology for implementing a load balancer on Linux is \nLinux Virtual Server\n (LVS). To use it with GridFTP, a single load balancer listens on a virtual IP address, monitors the health of the set of real GridFTP servers, and forwards requests to available ones. Optionally, there can be one or more inactive, backup load balancers that can activate and take over the virtual IP address in case the primary load balancer fails, resulting in a system that is more resilient to failure. LVS is implemented by the \nIP Virtual Server\n kernel module, which can be managed by userspace services on the load balancers such as \nkeepalived\n.\n\n\nThis guide explains how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot the \nkeepalived\n service on a load balancing host for a set of \nGridFTP\n servers.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\nThere must be a shared file system for file propagation across GridFTP servers\n\n\nYou must have reserved a virtual IP address and associated virtual hostname\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to each host\n\n\n\n\nDesigning Your Load-Balanced GridFTP System\n\n\nBefore beginning the installation process, you will need to plan the overall architecture of your load-balanced GridFTP system: the number of GridFTP servers, the type of shared file system to run on the GridFTP servers, whether or not backup load balancers are required, and hardware requirements.\n\n\nGridFTP servers\n\n\nThe number of GridFTP servers that you should run is determined first and foremost by the expected GridFTP transfer load at your site and the speed of the links available to each server. For example, if you expect a 20Gbps peak transfer load and have 10Gb links with 80\u201390% efficiency, you would need a minimum of 4 GridFTP servers: 3 to satisfy your desired throughput + 1 for failover or growth.\n\n\nShared file system\n\n\nThe number of GridFTP servers can also be determined by your hardware needs and by your choice of shared file system. If you choose a POSIX-based shared file system, plan for machines with more cores, or more GridFTP hosts to distribute the CPU load. If you are running \nGridFTP with Hadoop\n, plan for machines with more memory, or more GridFTP hosts to distribute the memory load.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you determine that you need only a single GridFTP host, you do not need load balancing. Instead, follow the \nstandalone-GridFTP installation guide\n.\n\n\n\n\nLoad balancer(s)\n\n\nIn the recommended direct routing mode, load balancers simply rewrite initial packets from a given request so the hardware requirements are minimal. When choosing load balancer hosts, aim for stability. If your chosen host is unstable or if you do not want to introduce downtime for operating system or hardware updates, at least one additional load balancer will be needed as a backup.\n\n\nPreparing the GridFTP Servers\n\n\nBefore adding your GridFTP hosts to the load-balanced system, each host requires the following:\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP software\n\n\nSpecial host certificates\n\n\nLoad-balancing configuration\n\n\n\n\nAcquiring host certificate(s)\n\n\nWhen authenticating with a GridFTP server, clients verify that the server's host certificate matches the hostname of the server. In the case of a load-balanced GridFTP system, clients contact the GridFTP server through the virtual hostname, so the GridFTP server will have to present a certificate containing the virtual hostname as well as the GridFTP server's hostname. Use the \nOSG host certificate reference\n for more information on how to request these types of certificates.  Additionally, a special procedure is available to acquire \nLet's Encrypt certificates\n with the load balanced gridftp.\n\n\nIf your GridFTP servers are also running XRootD, you will need unique certificates for each GridFTP server. Otherwise, you can request a single certificate that can be shared among the GridFTP servers.\n\n\nWithout XRootD\n\n\nThe single shared certificate must have the hostname associated with the load-balanced GridFTP system as its \ncommon name\n and each GridFTP servers hostname listed as \nsubject alternative names\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest and generate the shared certificate:\n\n\nuser@host $\n osg-cert-request --hostname \nVIRTUAL-HOSTNAME\n \n\\\n\n            --country \nCOUNTRY\n \n\\\n\n            --state \nSTATE\n \n\\\n\n            --locality \nLOCALITY\n \n\\\n\n            --organization \nORGANIZATION\n\n\n            --altname \nGRIDFTP-SERVER-#1-HOSTNAME\n \\\n\n\n            --altname \nGRIDFTP-SERVER-#2-HOSTNAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake the resulting CSR and get it signed by the appropriate authority.\n    Most institutions can use InCommon as outlined \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a directory to contain the shared certificate:\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /etc/grid-security/gridftp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace the shared certificate-key pair in the newly created directory:\n\n\nroot@host #\n mv \nPATH-TO-SERVICE-CERT\n /etc/grid-security/gridftp/gridftp-hostcert.pem\n\nroot@host #\n mv \nPATH-TO-SERVICE-KEY\n /etc/grid-security/gridftp/gridftp-hostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server\n to identify the shared certificate-key pair:\n\n\nexport X509_USER_CERT=/etc/grid-security/gridftp/gridftp-hostcert.pem\nexport X509_USER_KEY=/etc/grid-security/gridftp/gridftp-hostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith XRootD\n\n\nXRootD requires that the certificate's \ncommon name\n refers specifically to the host it resides on. To ensure each GridFTP server can authenticate using the virtual hostname, add it as the \nsubject alternative name\n for each certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a list of GridFTP server hostnames in \nload-balanced-hosts.txt\n:\n\n\nGRIDFTP-SERVER-#1-HOSTNAME\n \nVIRTUAL-HOSTNAME\n\n\nGRIDFTP-SERVER-#2-HOSTNAME\n \nVIRTUAL-HOSTNAME\n\n[...]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit a batch request for the per-GridFTP server certificates:\n\n\nuser@host $\n osg-gridadmin-cert-request -f load-balanced-hosts.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the resulting certificates and keys to their corresponding GridFTP servers in \n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n and \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Let's Encrypt\n\n\nThe certificate provided to the clients needs to have the virtual host address of the load balancer, as well as the hostname of each of the worker nodes.  Additionally, LetsEncrypt contacts the requested domains to verify ownership.  Therefore, each domain requested must be available to respond to HTTP requests at the same time.  The easiest method for this is to use a shared directory for Let's Encrypt's \ncertbot\n to install the secrets.\n\n\nThe procedure to acquire Let's Encrypt certificates for multiple hosts is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate or use a shared directory that each of the data transfer nodes can read, for example a simple NFS share.  The steps in creating a NFS shared directory is outside the scope of this guide.  In this guide, the shared directory will be referred as \n/mnt/nfsshare\n . \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nhttpd\n on each of the data transfer nodes:\n\n\nroot@host $\n yum install httpd\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a webroot directory within the shared directory on one of the nodes:\n\n\nroot@host $\n mkdir /mnt/nfsshare/webroot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure \nhttpd\n to export the same webroot on each of the data transfer nodes:\n\n\nVirtualHost *:80\n\n    DocumentRoot \n/mnt/nfsshare/webroot\n\n    \nDirectory \n/mnt/nfsshare/webroot\n\n        Require all granted\n    \n/Directory\n\n\n/VirtualHost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure \nkeepalived\n to virtualize port 80 to at least one of your data transfer nodes.\n    Add to your configuration:\n\n\nvirtual_server \nVIRTUAL-IP-ADDRESS\n 80 {\n    delay_loop 10\n    lb_algo wlc\n    lb_kind DR\n    protocol tcp\n\n    real_server \nGRIDFTP-SERVER-#1-IP ADDRESS\n {\n        TCP_CHECK {\n            connect_timeout 3\n            connect_port 80\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \ncertbot\n with the webroot options on only 1 of the data nodes.  The first domain in the command line should be the virtual hostname:\n\n\nroot@host $ certbot certonly -w /mnt/nfsshare/webroot -d \nVIRTUAL_HOSTNAME\n -d \nDATANODE_1\n -d \nDATANODE_N\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor XRootD certificates, the real hostname of the XRootD node is required to be the first hostname in the \ncertbot\n command.  You may run the \ncertbot\n command several times on the same host, replacing the \nVIRTUAL_HOSTNAME\n with the real hostname of the XRootD servers, and placing the \nVIRTUAL_HOSTNAME\n in in the list of other domains in the certificate.\n\n\nInstalling GridFTP\n\n\nWhether you are starting from scratch or adding more GridFTP servers to your load-balanced GridFTP system, follow the documentation for \ninstalling a standalone GridFTP server\n for each of your intended GridFTP servers (skip section 2.2, requesting a certificate). For hosts with GridFTP already installed, skip this section.\n\n\nConfiguring your GridFTP servers\n\n\nEach GridFTP server requires changes to its IP configuration and potentially its arptables:\n\n\n\n\nAdding your virtual IP address\n\n\nDisabling ARP\n \u2212 if your GridFTP servers are on the same network segment as the virtual IP\n\n\n\n\nAdding your virtual IP address\n\n\nUse the virtual IP address of your load balancer(s) as the secondary IPs of each of your GridFTP servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the virtual IP using the \nip\n tool:\n\n\nroot@host #\n ip addr add \nVIRTUAL-IP-ADDRESS\n/\nSUBNET-MASK\n dev \nNETWORK-INTERFACE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo persist the virtual IP changes across reboots, edit \n/etc/rc.d/rc.local\n, and add the same command as used above.\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that \n/etc/rc.d/rc.local\n is executable:\nroot@host #\n chmod u+x /etc/rc.d/rc.local\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisabling ARP\n\n\nIf your GridFTP servers and load balancer(s) are on the same network segment, you will have to disable ARP on the GridFTP servers to avoid \nARP race conditions\n. Otherwise, skip to \nthe section on preparing keepalived\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the appropriate RPM:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your operating system version is...\n\n\nThen use the following package(s)...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnterprise Linux 6\n\n\narptables_jf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnterprise Linux 7\n\n\narptables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the arptables software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install \nPACKAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable ARP:\n\n\nroot@host #\n arptables -F \n\nroot@host #\n arptables -A IN -d \nVIRTUAL-IP-ADDRESS\n -j DROP \n\nroot@host #\n arptables -A OUT -s \nVIRTUAL-IP-ADDRESS\n -j mangle --mangle-ip-s \nGRIDFTP-REAL-IP-ADDRESS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave ARP tables to survive reboots:\n\n\nroot@host #\n arptables-save \n /etc/sysconfig/arptables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing Keepalived Load Balancer(s)\n\n\nInstalling Keepalived\n\n\nWhether you run a single load balancer, or have one active load balancer and some inactive backups, each load balancer host must have the \nkeepalived\n software installed, configured, and running.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nDo not install \nkeepalived\n on the GridFTP servers themselves.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nkeepalived\n package is available from standard operating system repositories.

One general-purpose technology for implementing a load balancer on Linux is  Linux Virtual Server  (LVS). To use it with GridFTP, a single load balancer listens on a virtual IP address, monitors the health of the set of real GridFTP servers, and forwards requests to available ones. Optionally, there can be one or more inactive, backup load balancers that can activate and take over the virtual IP address in case the primary load balancer fails, resulting in a system that is more resilient to failure. LVS is implemented by the  IP Virtual Server  kernel module, which can be managed by userspace services on the load balancers such as  keepalived .  This guide explains how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot the  keepalived  service on a load balancing host for a set of  GridFTP  servers.",

The easiest method for this is to use a shared directory for Let's Encrypt's  certbot  to install the secrets.  The procedure to acquire Let's Encrypt certificates for multiple hosts is as follows:    Create or use a shared directory that each of the data transfer nodes can read, for example a simple NFS share.  The steps in creating a NFS shared directory is outside the scope of this guide.  In this guide, the shared directory will be referred as  /mnt/nfsshare  .

For XRootD certificates, the real hostname of the XRootD node is required to be the first hostname in the  certbot  command.

all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling XRootD\n\n\nTo install the XRootD Standalone server, run the following Yum command:\n\n\nroot@xrootd-standalone #\n yum install osg-xrootd-standalone\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring XRootD\n\n\nTo configure XRootD as a standalone server, you will modify \n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-standalone.cfg\n and the config files\nunder \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/\n as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure a \nrootdir\n in \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/10-common-site-local.cfg\n, to point to the top of the directory\n    hierarchy which you wish to serve via XRootD.\n\n\nset rootdir = \nDIRECTORY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nDo not set \nrootdir\n to \n/\n.\nThis might result in serving private information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to limit the sub-directories to serve under your configured \nrootdir\n,\n    comment out the \nall.export /\n directive in\n    \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/90-osg-standalone-paths.cfg\n,\n    and add an \nall.export\n directive for each directory under \nrootdir\n that you wish to serve via XRootD.\n\n\nThis is useful if you have a mixture of files under your \nrootdir\n, for example from multiple users,\nbut only want to expose a subset of them to the world.\n\n\nFor example, to serve the contents of \n/data/store\n and \n/data/public\n (with \nrootdir\n configured to \n/data\n):\n\n\nall.export /store/\nall.export /public/\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to serve everything under your configured \nrootdir\n, you don't have to change anything.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe directories specified this way are writable by default.\nAccess controls should be managed via \nauthorization configuration\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/10-common-site-local.cfg\n, add a line to set the \nresourcename\n variable to the\n   \nresource name\n of your XRootD service.\n   For example, the XRootD service registered at the\n   \nUniversity of Florida site\n\n   should set the following configuration:\n\n\nset resourcename = UFlorida-XRD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nCMS sites should follow CMS policy for \nresourcename\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL 6, set the default options to use the standalone configuration in the \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd\n file.\n\n\nXROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-standalone.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring authorization\n\n\nTo configure XRootD authorization please follow the documentation \nhere\n.\n\n\nOptional configuration\n\n\nThe following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be required for setting up a small site.\nIf you do not need any of the following special configurations, skip to\n\nthe section on using XRootD\n.\n\n\nEnabling Hadoop support (EL 7 Only)\n\n\nFor documentation on how to export your Hadoop storage using XRootD please see\n\nthis documentation\n\n\nEnabling CMS TFC support (CMS sites only)\n\n\nFor CMS users, there is a package available to integrate rule-based name lookup using a \nstorage.xml\n file.\nSee \nthis documentation\n.\n\n\nUsing XRootD\n\n\nIn addition to the XRootD service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation.\nThe specific services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService Name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch CRL\n\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n and \nfetch-crl-cron\n\n\nSee \nCA documentation\n for more info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRootD\n\n\nEL 7:\nxrootd@standalone\n, EL 6:\nxrootd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the services in the order listed and stop them in reverse order.\nAs a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as \nroot\n):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \u2026\n\n\nOn EL 7, run the command\u2026\n\n\nOn EL 6, run the command\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a service\n\n\nsystemctl start SERVICE-NAME\n\n\nservice SERVICE-NAME start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop a service\n\n\nsystemctl stop SERVICE-NAME\n\n\nservice SERVICE-NAME stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable a service to start during boot\n\n\nsystemctl enable SERVICE-NAME\n\n\nchkconfig SERVICE-NAME on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable a service from starting during boot\n\n\nsystemctl disable SERVICE-NAME\n\n\nchkconfig SERVICE-NAME off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidating XRootD\n\n\nTo validate an XRootD installation, perform the following verification steps:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you have configured authentication/authorization for XRootD,\nbe sure you have given yourself the necessary permissions to run these tests.\nFor example, if you are using a grid proxy,\nmake sure your DN is mapped to a user in \n/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile\n,\nand make sure you have a valid proxy on your local machine.\nAlso, ensure that the \nAuthfile\n on the XRootD server gives write access to the Unix user you will get mapped to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify file transfer over the XRootD protocol using XRootD client tools:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the client tools:\n\n\nroot@xrootd-standalone #\n yum install xrootd-client\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy a file to a directory for which you have write access:\n\n\nroot@xrootd-standalone #\n xrdcp /bin/sh root://localhost:1094//tmp/first_test\n\n[xrootd] Total 0.76 MB  [====================] 100.00 % [inf MB/s]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the file has been copied over:\n\n\nroot@xrootd-standalone #\n ls -l /tmp/first_test\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 xrootd xrootd 801512 Apr 11 10:48 /tmp/first_test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify file transfer over HTTP using GFAL2 client tools:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the GFAL2 client tools:\n\n\nroot@xrootd-standalone #\n yum install gfal2-util gfal2-plugin-http\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy a file to a directory for which you have write access:\n\n\nroot@xrootd-standalone #\n gfal-copy /bin/sh http://localhost:1094//tmp/first_test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the file has been copied

Server\n\n\nTo register your XRootD server, follow the general registration instructions\n\nhere\n with the following XRootD-specific details:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd an \nXRootD component:\n section to the \nServices:\n list, with any relevant fields for that service.\n    This is a partial example:\n\n\n...\n\n\nFQDN: \nFULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME\n\n\nServices:\n\n\n  XRootD component:\n\n\n

An XRootD system includes a \nredirector\n, which accepts\nrequests for data and finds a storage repository\u00a0\u2014 locally or\notherwise\u00a0\u2014 that can provide the data to the requestor.\n\n\nUse this page to learn how to install, configure, and use an XRootD redirector as part of a Storage Element (SE) or as\npart of a global namespace.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points:\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If it does not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user ID \nxrootd\n\n\nService certificate:\n The XRootD service uses a host certificate at \n/etc/grid-security/host*.pem\n\n\nNetworking:\n The XRootD service uses port 1094 by default\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling an XRootD Server\n\n\nAn installation of the XRootD server consists of the server itself and its dependencies. \nInstall these with Yum:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring an XRootD Server\n\n\nAn advanced XRootD setup has multiple components; it is important to validate that each additional component that you\nset up is working before moving on to the next component. \nWe have included validation instructions after each component below.\n\n\nCreating an XRootD cluster\n\n\n\n\nIf your storage is spread out over multiple hosts, you will need to set up an XRootD \ncluster\n. \nThe cluster uses one \"redirector\" node as a frontend for user accesses, and multiple data nodes that have the data that\nusers request. \nTwo daemons will run on each node:\n\n\nxrootd\n\nThe eXtended Root Daemon controls file access and storage.\n\n\ncmsd\n\nThe Cluster Management Services Daemon controls communication between nodes.\n\n\nNote that for large virtual organizations, a site-level redirector may actually also communicate upwards to a regional\nor global redirector that handles access to a multi-level hierarchy. \nThis section will only cover handling one level of XRootD hierarchy.\n\n\nIn the instructions below, \nRDRNODE\n will refer to the redirector host and \nDATANODE\n will\nrefer to the data node host. \nThese should be replaced with the fully-qualified domain name of the host in question.\n\n\nModify /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nYou will need to modify the \nxrootd-clustered.cfg\n on the redirector node and each data node. \nThe following example should serve as a base configuration for clustering. Further customizations are detailed below.\n\n\nall.export /mnt/xrootd stage\n\nset xrdr = \nRDRNODE\n\n\nall.manager $(xrdr):3121\n\nif $(xrdr)\n  # Lines in this block are only executed on the redirector node\n  all.role manager\nelse\n  # Lines in this block are executed on all nodes but the redirector node\n  all.role server\n\n  cms.space min 2g 5g\n\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to customize the following lines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Line\n\n\nChanges Needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nall.export /mnt/xrootd stage\n\n\nChange \n/mnt/xrootd\n to the directory to allow XRootD access to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset xrdr=\nRDRNODE\n\n\nChange to the hostname of the redirector\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncms.space min 2g 5g\n\n\nReserve this amount of free space on the node. For this example, if space falls below 2GB, xrootd will not store further files on this node until space climbs above 5GB. You can use \nk\n, \nm\n, \ng\n, or \nt\n to indicate kilobyte, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information can be found at \nhttps://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/docs.html\n\n\nVerifying the clustered config\n\n\nStart both \nxrootd\n and \ncmsd\n on all nodes according to the instructions in the \nmanaging services\nsection\n.\n\n\nVerify that you can copy a file such as \n/bin/sh\n to \n/mnt/xrootd\n on the server data via the redirector:\n\n\nroot@host #\n xrdcp /bin/sh  root://\nRDRNODE\n:1094///mnt/xrootd/second_test\n\n[xrootd] Total 0.76 MB  [====================] 100.00 % [inf MB/s]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck that the \n/mnt/xrootd/second_test\n is located on data server \nDATANODE\n.\n\n\n(Optional) Adding Simple Server Inventory to your cluster\n\n\nThe Simple Server Inventory (SSI) provide means to have an inventory for each data server. \nSSI requires:\n\n\n\n\nA second instance of the \nxrootd\n daemon on the redirector\n\n\nA \"composite name space daemon\" (\nXrdCnsd\n) on each data server; this daemon handles the inventory\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, we will set up a two-node XRootD cluster with SSI.\n\n\nHost A is a redirector node that is running the following daemons:\n\n\n\n\nxrootd redirector\n\n\ncmsd\n\n\nxrootd - second instance that required for SSI\n\n\n\n\nHost B is a data server that is running the following daemons:\n\n\n\n\nxrootd data server\n\n\ncmsd\n\n\nXrdCnsd - started automatically by xrootd\n\n\n\n\nWe will need to create a directory on the redirector node for Inventory files.\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /data/inventory\n\nroot@host #\n chown xrootd:xrootd /data/inventory\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the data server (host B) let's use a storage cache that will be at a different location from \n/mnt/xrootd\n. \n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p  /local/xrootd\n\nroot@host #\n chown xrootd:xrootd /local/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be running two instances of XRootD on \nHOST A\n.\nModify \n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n to give the two instances different behavior, as such:\n\n\nall.export /data/xrootdfs\n\nset xrdr=\nHOST A\n\n\nall.manager $(xrdr):3121\nif $(xrdr) \n named cns\n      all.export /data/inventory\n      xrd.port 1095\nelse if $(xrdr)\n      all.role manager\n      xrd.port 1094\nelse\n      all.role server\n      oss.localroot /local/xrootd\n      ofs.notify closew create mkdir mv rm rmdir trunc | /usr/bin/XrdCnsd -d -D 2 -i 90 -b $(xrdr):1095:/data/inventory\n      #add cms.space if you have less the 11GB\n      # cms.space options https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/doc/dev410/cms_config.htm\n      cms.space min 2g 5g\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of \noss.localroot\n will be prepended to any file access.\n\nE.g. accessing \nroot://\nRDRNODE\n:1094//data/xrootdfs/test1\n will actually go to\n\n/local/xrootd/data/xrootdfs/test1\n.\n\n\nStarting a second instance of XRootD on EL 6\n\n\nThe procedure for starting a second instance differs between EL 6 and EL 7. \nThis section is the procedure for EL 6.\n\n\nNow, we have to change \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd\n on the redirector node (\nHOST A\n) to run multiple instances\nof XRootD. \nThe second instance of XRootD will be named \"cns\" and will be used for SSI.\n\n\nXROOTD_USER=xrootd \nXROOTD_GROUP=xrootd \n\nXROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-k 7 -l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nXROOTD_CNS_OPTIONS=\n-k 7 -l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-k 7 -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nFRMD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-k 7 -l /var/log/xrootd/frmd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nXROOTD_INSTANCES=\ndefault cns\n\n\nCMSD_INSTANCES=\ndefault\n \nFRMD_INSTANCES=\ndefault\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can start XRootD cluster executing the following commands. \nOn redirector you will see:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service xrootd start \n\nStarting xrootd (xrootd, default): [ OK ]\n\n\nStarting xrootd (xrootd, cns): [ OK ]\n\n\nroot@host #\n service cmsd start \n\nStarting xrootd (cmsd, default): [ OK ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn redirector node you should see two instances of xrootd running:\n\n\nroot@host #\n ps auxww\n|\ngrep xrootd\n\nxrootd 29036 0.0 0.0 44008 3172 ?

To do that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure \nLCMAPS authorization\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncomment the following line in \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/10-xrootd-lcmaps.cfg\n:\n\n\nset EnableLcmaps = 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, add the following line to the same file:\n\n\nset EnableHttp = 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting the configuration\n\n\nFrom the terminal, generate a proxy and attempt to use davix-get to copy from your XRootD host (the XRootD service needs running; see the \nservices section\n).  For example, if your server has a file named \n/store/user/test.root\n:\n\n\ndavix-get https://\nYOUR FQDN\n:1094/store/user/test.root -E /mnt/xrootd/x509up_u`id -u` --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor clients to successfully read from the regional redirector, HTTPS must be enabled for the data servers and the site-level redirector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you have \nu *\n in your Authfile, recall this provides an authorization to ALL users, including unauthenticated. This includes random web spiders!\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) Enable HTTP based Writes\n\n\nNo changes to the HTTP module is needed to enable HTTP-based writes.  The HTTP protocol uses the same authorization setup as the XRootD protocol.  For example, you may need to provide \na\n (all) style authorizations to allow users authorization to write. See the \nAuthentication File section\n for more details.\n\n\n(Optional) Enabling a FUSE mount\n\n\nXRootD storage can be mounted as a standard POSIX filesystem via FUSE, providing users with a more familiar interface..\n\n\nModify \n/etc/fstab\n by adding the following entries:\n\n\n....\nxrootdfs                /mnt/xrootd              fuse    rdr=xroot://\nREDIRECTOR FQDN\n:1094/\nPATH TO FILE\n,uid=xrootd 0 0\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \n/mnt/xrootd\n with the path that you would like to access with. \nThis should also match the GridFTP settings for the \nXROOTD_VMP\n local path. \nCreate \n/mnt/xrootd\n directory. Make sure the xrootd user exists on the system. Once you are finished, you can mount it:\n\n\nmount /mnt/xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to run UNIX commands such as \nls /mnt/xrootd\n to see the contents of the XRootD server.\n\n\n(Optional) Authorization\n\n\nFor information on how to configure xrootd-lcmaps authorization, please refer to the\n\nConfiguring XRootD Authorization guide\n.\n\n\n(Optional) Adding CMS TFC support to XRootD (CMS sites only)\n\n\nFor CMS users, there is a package available to integrate rule-based name lookup using a \nstorage.xml\n file. \nIf you are not setting up a CMS site, you can skip this section.\n\n\nyum install --enablerepo=osg-contrib xrootd-cmstfc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to add your \nstorage.xml\n to \n/etc/xrootd/storage.xml\n and then add the following line to your XRootD\nconfiguration:\n\n\n# Integrate with CMS TFC, placed in /etc/xrootd/storage.xml\noss.namelib /usr/lib64/libXrdCmsTfc.so file:/etc/xrootd/storage.xml?protocol=hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the orange text only if you are running hadoop (see below).\n\n\nSee the CMS TWiki for more information:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/XrootdTfcChanges\n\n\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/HdfsXrootdInstall\n\n\n\n\n(Optional) Adding Hadoop support to XRootD\n\n\nHadoop File System (HDFS) based sites should utilize the \nxrootd-hdfs\n plugin to allow XRootD to access their storage:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the XRootD HDFS plugin package:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install xrootd-hdfs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following configuration to \n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n:\n\n\nofs.osslib /usr/lib64/libXrdHdfs.so\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see \nthe HDFS installation documents\n.\n\n\n(Optional) Adding File Residency Manager (FRM) to an XRootd cluster\n\n\nIf you have a multi-tiered storage system (e.g. some data is stored on SSDs and some on disks or tapes), then install\nthe File Residency Manager (FRM), so you can move data between tiers more easily. \nIf you do not have a multi-tiered storage system, then you do not need FRM and you can skip this section.\n\n\nThe FRM deals with two major mechanisms:\n\n\n\n\nlocal disk\n\n\nremote servers\n\n\n\n\nThe description of fully functional multiple XRootD clusters is beyond the scope of this document. \nIn order to have this fully functional system you will need a global redirector and at least one remote XRootD cluster\nfrom where files could be moved to the local cluster.\n\n\nBelow are the modifications you should make in order to enable FRM on your local cluster:\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that FRM is enabled in \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd\n on your data sever:\n\n\n\n\nROOTD_USER=xrootd \nXROOTD_GROUP=xrootd \nXROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n \nCMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n \nFRMD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/frmd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n \nXROOTD_INSTANCES=\ndefault\n \nCMSD_INSTANCES=\ndefault\n \nFRMD_INSTANCES=\ndefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n on both nodes to specify options for \nfrm_xfrd\n (File Transfer Daemon) and \nfrm_purged\n (File Purging Daemon).

Covers the creation of\n    a load-balanced GridFTP service using multiple servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to following this installation guide, verify the host certificates and networking is configured correctly as in\nthe \nbasic GridFTP install\n.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nGridFTP support for XRootD-based storage is provided by the \nosg-gridftp-xrootd\n meta-package:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-gridftp-xrootd\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nFor information on how to configure authentication for your GridFTP installation, please refer to the \nconfiguring\nauthentication section of the GridFTP guide\n.\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd-dsi\n to set \nXROOTD_VMP\n to use your XRootD redirector.\n\n\nexport\n \nXROOTD_VMP\n=\nredirector:1094:/local_path=/remote_path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe syntax of \nXROOTD_VMP\n is tricky; make sure to use the following guidance:\n\n\n\n\nRedirector\n: The hostname and domain of the local XRootD redirector server.\n\n\nlocal_path\n: The path exported by the GridFTP server.\n\n\nremote_path\n: The XRootD path that will be mounted at \nlocal_path\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \nxrootd-dsi\n is enabled, GridFTP configuration changes should go into \n/etc/xrootd-dsi/gridftp-xrootd.conf\n, not\n\n/etc/gridftp.conf\n.\n\nSites should review any customizations made in the latter and copy them as necessary.\n\n\nYou can use the FUSE mount in order to test POSIX access to xrootd in the GridFTP server.\nYou should be able to run Unix commands such as \nls /mnt/xrootd\n and see the contents of the XRootD server.\n\n\nFor log / config file locations and system services to run, see the \nbasic GridFTP install\n.\n\n\nUsing XRootD\n\n\nManaging XRootD services\n\n\nStart services on the redirector node before starting any services on the data nodes. \nIf you installed only XRootD itself, you will only need to start the \nxrootd\n service. \nHowever, if you installed cluster management services, you will need to start \ncmsd\n as well.\n\n\nThe instructions for starting and stopping an XRootD service depend on whether the service is installed on an EL 6 or EL\n7 machine, and whether you are using a standalone or clustered configuration.\n\n\nOn EL 6, which config to use is set in the file \n/etc/sysconfig/xrootd\n. \nFor example, to have \nxrootd\n use the clustered config, you would have a line such as this:\n\n\nXROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the standalone config instead, you would use:\n\n\nXROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=\n-l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-standalone.cfg -k fifo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn EL 7, which config to use is determined by the service name given to \nsystemctl\n. \nFor example, to have \nxrootd\n use the clustered config, you would start up \nxrootd\n with this line:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start xrootd@clustered\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the standalone config instead, you would use:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl start xrootd@standalone\n\n\n\n\n\nThe services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService\n\n\nEL 6 service name\n\n\nEL 7 service name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRootD (standalone config)\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\nxrootd@standalone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRootD (clustered config)\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\nxrootd@clustered\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMSD (clustered config)\n\n\ncmsd\n\n\ncmsd@clustered\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as \nroot\n):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \u2026\n\n\nOn EL\u00a06, run the command\u2026\n\n\nOn EL\u00a07, run the command\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a service\n\n\nservice SERVICE-NAME start\n\n\nsystemctl start SERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop a service\n\n\nservice SERVICE-NAME stop\n\n\nsystemctl stop SERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable a service to start during boot\n\n\nchkconfig SERVICE-NAME on\n\n\nsystemctl enable SERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable a service from starting during boot\n\n\nchkconfig SERVICE-NAME off\n\n\nsystemctl disable SERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nTo get assistance. please use the \nHelp Procedure\n page.\n\n\nReference\n\n\nFile locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService/Process\n\n\nConfiguration File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg\n\n\nMain clustered mode XRootD configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/xrootd/auth_file\n\n\nAuthorized users file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService/Process\n\n\nLog File\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxrootd\n\n\n/var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log\n\n\nXRootD server daemon log\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncmsd\n\n\n/var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log\n\n\nCluster management log\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncns\n\n\n/var/log/xrootd/cns/xrootd.log\n\n\nServer inventory (composite name space) log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrm_xfrd\n, \nfrm_purged\n\n\n/var/log/xrootd/frmd.log\n\n\nFile Residency Manager log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\nXRootD documentation",

This service allows a site or regional\nnetwork to cache data frequently used by the \nCMS experiment\n, reducing data transfer over the wide-area network and\ndecreasing access latency. The are two types of installations described in this document: single or multinode cache. The difference might be based on the total disk that your cache needs.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\nOperating system:\n A RHEL 7 or compatible operating systems.\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user IDs \nxrootd\n\n\nHost certificate:\n Required for client authentication and authentication with CMS VOMS Server\n  See our \ndocumentation\n for instructions on how to request and install host certificates.\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n The cache service requires the following ports open:\n\n\nInbound TCP port 1094 for file access via the XRootD protocol\n\n\nOutbound UDP port 9930 for reporting to \nxrd-report.osgstorage.org\n and \nxrd-mon.osgstorage.org\n for monitoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware requirements:\n We recommend that a cache has at least 10Gbps connectivity, 100TB of\n disk space for the whole cache (can be divided among several caches), and 8GB of RAM.\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the Cache\n\n\nThe CMS XCache ROM software consists of an XRootD server with special configuration and supporting services.\nTo simplify installation, OSG provides convenience RPMs that install all required\npackages with a single command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install cms-xcache\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Cache\n\n\nFirst, you must create a \"cache directory\", which will be used to store downloaded files.\nBy default this is \n/mnt/stash\n.\nWe recommend using a separate file system for the cache directory,\nwith at least 1 TB of storage available.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe cache directory must be writable by the \nxrootd:xrootd\n user and group.\n\n\n\n\nThe \ncms-xcache\n package provides default configuration files in \n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-cms-xcache.cfg\n and \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/\n.\nAdministrators may provide additional configuration by placing files in \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/1*.cfg\n (for files that need to be processed BEFORE the OSG configuration) or \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/9*.cfg\n (for files that need to be processed AFTER the OSG configuration).\n\n\nYou \nmust\n configure every variable in \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/10-common-site-local.cfg\n.\n\n\nThe mandatory variables to configure are:\n\n\n\n\nset rootdir = /mnt/stash\n: the mounted filesystem path to export.  This document refers to this as \n/mnt/stash\n.\n\n\nset resourcename = YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME\n: the resource name registered with the OSG for example (\"T2_US_UCSD\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nXRootD can manage a set of independent disk for the cache. So you can modify file \n90-cms-xcache-disks.cfg\n and add the disks there then \nrootdir\n just becomes a place to hold symlinks.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the xrootd service has a certificate\n\n\nThe service will need a certificate for reporting and to authenticate to CMS AAA.\nThe easiest solution for this is to use your host certificate and key as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCopy the host certificate to \n/etc/grid-security/xrd/xrd{cert,key}.pem\n\n\nSet the owner of the directory and contents \n/etc/grid-security/xrd/\n to \nxrootd:xrootd\n:\nroot@host #\n chown -R xrootd:xrootd /etc/grid-security/xrd/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou must repeat the above steps whenever you renew your host certificate.\nIf you automate certificate renewal, you should automate copying as well.\nFor example, if you are using Certbot for Let's Encrypt, you should write a \"deploy hook\" as documented\n\nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou must also register this certificate with the CMS VOMS (https://voms2.cern.ch:8443/voms/cms/)\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Optional Features\n\n\nAdjust disk utilization\n\n\nTo adjust the disk utilization of your cache, create or edit a file named \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/90-local.cfg\n\nand set the values of \npfc.diskusage\n.\n\n\npfc.diskusage 0.90 0.95\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two values correspond to the low and high usage water marks, respectively.\nWhen usage goes above the high water mark,\nthe XRootD service will delete cached files until usage goes below the low water mark.\n\n\nModify the storage access settings at a site\n\n\nIn order for CMSSW jobs to use the cache at your site you need to modify the \nstorage.xml\n and create the following rules\n\n\n# Portions of /store in xcache\n  \nlfn-to-pfn protocol=\ndirect\n destination-match=\n.*\n\n    path-match=\n/+store/(data/.*/.*/NANOAOD/.*)\n\n    result=\nroot://yourlocalcache:1094//store/$1\n/\n\n  \nlfn-to-pfn protocol=\ndirect\n destination-match=\n.*\n\n    path-match=\n/+store/(mc/.*/.*/NANOAODSIM/.*)\n\n    result=\nroot://yourlocalcache:1094//store/$1\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are installing a \nmultinode cache\n then instead of \nyourlocalcache:1094\n url should be changed for \nyourcacheredirector:2040\n\n\n\n\nEnable remote debugging\n\n\nXRootD provides remote debugging via a read-only file system named digFS.\nThis feature is disabled by default, but you may enable it if you need help troubleshooting your server.\n\n\nTo enable remote debugging, edit \n/etc/xrootd/digauth.cfg\n and specify the authorizations for reading digFS.\nAn example of authorizations:\n\n\nall allow gsi g=/glow h=*.cs.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives access to the config file, log files, core files, and process information\nto anyone from \n*.cs.wisc.edu\n in the \n/glow\n VOMS group.\n\n\nSee \nthe XRootD manual\n for the full syntax.\n\n\nRemote debugging should only be enabled for as long as you need assistance.\nAs soon as your issue has been resolved, revert any changes you have made to \n/etc/xrootd/digauth.cfg\n.\n\n\nInstalling a Multinode Cache (optional)\n\n\nSome sites would like to have a single logical cache composed of several nodes as shown below:\n\n\n\n\nThis can be achieved by following the next steps\n\n\nInstall an XCache redirector\n\n\nThis can be a simple lightweight virtual machine and will be the single point of contact from jobs to the caches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the redirector package\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install xcache-redirector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate file named \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/04-local-redir.cfg\n with contents:\n\n\nall.manager yourlocalredir:2041\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou \nmust\n configure every variable in \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/10-common-site-local.cfg\n.

This service allows a site or regional\nnetwork to cache data frequently used on the OSG, reducing data transfer over the wide-area network and\ndecreasing access latency.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\nOperating system:\n A RHEL 7 or compatible operating systems.\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user IDs \ncondor\n and\n  \nxrootd\n\n\nHost certificate:\n Required for reporting and authenticated StashCache.\n  Authenticated StashCache is an optional feature.\n  See our \ndocumentation\n for instructions on how to request and install host certificates.\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n The cache service requires the following ports open:\n\n\nInbound TCP port 1094 for file access via the XRootD protocol\n\n\nInbound TCP port 8000 for file access via HTTP\n\n\nInbound TCP port 8443 for authenticated file access via HTTPS (optional)\n\n\nOutbound UDP port 9930 for reporting to \nxrd-report.osgstorage.org\n and \nxrd-mon.osgstorage.org\n for monitoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware requirements:\n We recommend that a cache has at least 10Gbps connectivity, 1TB of\n disk space for the cache directory, and 8GB of RAM.\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nRegistering the Cache\n\n\nTo be part of the OSG StashCache Federation, your cache must be registered with the OSG.\nYou will need basic information like the resource name and hostname,\nand the administrative and security contacts.\n\n\nInitial registration\n\n\nTo register your cache host, follow the general registration instructions \nhere\n.\nThe service type is \nXRootD cache server\n.\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nThis step must be completed before installation.\n\n\n\n\nIn your registration, you must specify which VOs your cache will serve by adding an \nAllowedVOs\n list, with each line specifying a VO whose data you are willing to cache.\n\n\nThere are special values you may use in \nAllowedVOs\n:\n\n\n\n\nANY_PUBLIC\n indicates that the cache is willing to serve public data from any VO.\n\n\nANY\n indicates that the cache is willing to serve data from any VO,\n  both public and non-public.\n  \nANY\n implies \nANY_PUBLIC\n.\n\n\n\n\nThere are extra requirements for serving non-public data:\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the cache allowing a VO in the \nAllowedVOs\n list,\n  that VO must also allow the cache in its \nAllowedCaches\n list.\n  See the page on \ngetting your VO's data into StashCache\n.\n\n\nThere must be an authenticated XRootD instance on the cache server.\n\n\nThere must be a \nDN\n attribute in the resource registration\n  with the \nsubject DN\n of the host certificate\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example

ticket\n with your cache name.\nMention in your ticket that you would like to \"Finalize the cache registration.\"\n\n\nInstalling the Cache\n\n\nThe StashCache software consists of an XRootD server with special configuration and supporting services.\nTo simplify installation, OSG provides convenience RPMs that install all required\npackages with a single command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install stash-cache\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Cache\n\n\nFirst, you must create a \"cache directory\", which will be used to store downloaded files.\nBy default this is \n/mnt/stash\n.\nWe recommend using a separate file system for the cache directory,\nwith at least 1 TB of storage available.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe cache directory must be writable by the \nxrootd:xrootd\n user and group.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nstash-cache\n package provides default configuration files in \n/etc/xrootd/xrootd-stash-cache.cfg\n and \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/\n.\nAdministrators may provide additional configuration by placing files in \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/1*.cfg\n (for files that need to be processed BEFORE the OSG configuration) or \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/9*.cfg\n (for files that need to be processed AFTER the OSG configuration).\n\n\nYou \nmust\n configure every variable in \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/10-common-site-local.cfg\n.\n\n\nThe mandatory variables to configure are:\n\n\n\n\nset rootdir = /mnt/stash\n: the mounted filesystem path to export.  This document refers to this as \n/mnt/stash\n.\n\n\nset resourcename = YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME\n: the resource name registered with the OSG.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the xrootd service has a certificate\n\n\nThe service will need a certificate for reporting and to authenticate to StashCache origins.\nThe easiest solution for this is to use your host certificate and key as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCopy the host certificate to \n/etc/grid-security/xrd/xrd{cert,key}.pem\n\n\nSet the owner of the directory and contents \n/etc/grid-security/xrd/\n to \nxrootd:xrootd\n:\nroot@host #\n chown -R xrootd:xrootd /etc/grid-security/xrd/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou must repeat the above steps whenever you renew your host certificate.\nIf you automate certificate renewal, you should automate copying as well.\nFor example, if you are using Certbot for Let's Encrypt, you should write a \"deploy hook\" as documented\n\non the Certbot site\n.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Optional Features\n\n\nAdjust disk utilization\n\n\nTo adjust the disk utilization of your cache, create or edit a file named \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/90-local.cfg\n\nand set the values of \npfc.diskusage\n.\n\n\npfc.diskusage 0.90 0.95\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two values correspond to the low and high usage water marks, respectively.\nWhen usage goes above the high water mark,\nthe XRootD service will delete cached files until usage goes below the low water mark.\n\n\nEnable remote debugging\n\n\nXRootD provides remote debugging via a read-only file system named digFS.\nThis feature is disabled by default, but you may enable it if you need help troubleshooting your server.\n\n\nTo enable remote debugging, edit \n/etc/xrootd/digauth.cfg\n and specify the authorizations for reading digFS.\nAn example of authorizations:\n\n\nall allow gsi g=/glow h=*.cs.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives access to the config file, log files, core files, and process information\nto anyone from \n*.cs.wisc.edu\n in the \n/glow\n VOMS group.\n\n\nSee \nthe XRootD manual\n for the full syntax.\n\n\nRemote debugging should only be enabled for as long as you need assistance.\nAs soon as your issue has been resolved, revert any changes you have made to \n/etc/xrootd/digauth.cfg\n.\n\n\nEnable HTTPS on the unauthenticated cache\n\n\nBy default, the unauthenticated stash-cache instance uses plain HTTP, not HTTPS.\nTo use HTTPS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a certificate according to the \ninstructions above\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a file named \n/etc/xrootd/config.d/11-cache-https.cfg\n with the following contents:\n\n\n# Support HTTPS access to unauthenticated cache\nif named stash-cache\n  http.cadir /etc/grid-security/certificates\n  http.cert /etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdcert.pem\n  http.key /etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdkey.pem\n  http.secxtractor /usr/lib64/libXrdLcmaps.so\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManually Setting the FQDN (optional)\n\n\nThe FQDN of the cache server that you registered in \nTopology\n may be different than its internal hostname\n(as reported by \nhostname -f\n).\nFor example, this may be the case if your cache is behind a load balancer such as LVS or MetalLB.\nIn this case, you must manually tell the cache services which FQDN to use for topology lookups.\n\n\n\n\nCreate the file \n/etc/systemd/system/stash-cache-authfile.service.d/override.conf\n\n    with the following contents:\n[Service]\n\n\nEnvironment\n=\nCACHE_FQDN=\nTopology-registered FQDN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging StashCache and associated services\n\n\nThese services must be managed by \nsystemctl\n and may start additional services as dependencies.\nAs a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as \nroot\n) for EL7:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo...\n\n\nOn EL7, run the command...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a service\n\n\nsystemctl start \nSERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop a service\n\n\nsystemctl stop \nSERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable a service to start on boot\n\n\nsystemctl enable \nSERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable a service from starting on boot\n\n\nsystemctl disable \nSERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic cache services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRootD\n\n\nxrootd@stash-cache.service\n\n\nThe XRootD daemon, which performs the data transfers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXCache\n\n\nxcache-reporter.timer\n\n\nReports usage information to collector.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch CRL\n\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n and \nfetch-crl-cron\n\n\nRequired to authenticate monitoring services.  See \nCA documentation\n for more info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthenticated cache services (optional)\n\n\nIn addition to the public cache services, there are three systemd units specific to the authenticated cache.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRootD\n\n\nxrootd-renew-proxy.service\n\n\nRenew a proxy for authenticated downloads to the cache\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxrootd@stash-cache-auth.service\n\n\nThe xrootd daemon which performs authenticated data transfers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxrootd-renew-proxy.timer\n\n\nTrigger daily proxy renewal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstash-cache-authfile.service\n\n\nGenerate the Authentication configuration file for XRootD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstash-cache-authfile.timer\n\n\nPeriodically generate the Authentication configuration file for XRootD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidating the Cache\n\n\nThe cache server functions as a normal HTTP server and can interact with typical HTTP clients, such as \ncurl\n.\n\n\nuser@host $\n curl -O http://cache_host:8000/osgconnect/public/rynge/test.data\n\n\n\n\n\ncurl\n may not correctly report a failure, so verify that the contents of the file are:\n\n\nhello world!\n\n\n\n\n\nTest cache server reporting to the central collector\n\n\nTo verify the cache is reporting to the central collector, run the following command from the cache server:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_status -any -pool collector.opensciencegrid.org:9619 \n\\\n\n                          -l -const \nName==\\\nxrootd@`hostname`\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output of the above command should detail what the collector knows about the status of your cache.\nHere is an example snippet of the output:\n\n\nAuthenticatedIdentity = \nsc-cache.chtc.wisc.edu@daemon.opensciencegrid.org\n\nAuthenticationMethod = \nGSI\n\nfree_cache_bytes = 868104454144\nfree_cache_fraction = 0.8022261674321525\nLastHeardFrom = 1552002482\nmost_recent_access_time = 1551997049\nMyType = \nMachine\n\nName = \nxrootd@sc-cache.chtc.wisc.edu\n\nping_elapsed_time = 0.00763392448425293\nping_response_code = 0\nping_response_message = \n[SUCCESS] \n\nping_response_status = \nok\n\nSTASHCACHE_DaemonVersion = \n1.0.0\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nTo get assistance, please use the \nthis page\n or contact \n directly.",

            "text": "Hadoop Overview\n\n\nHadoop Introduction\n\n\nHadoop is a data processing framework.\nThe framework has two main parts - job scheduling and a distributed file system,\nthe Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).  \n\n\nWe currently utilize HDFS as a general-purpose file system. For this document,\nwe'll use the words \"Hadoop\" and \"HDFS\" interchangeably, but it's nice to know\nthe distinction.\n\n\nThe HDFS file system has several features, some of which differ a bit from a typical\nfile system:\n\n\n\n\nEach file is broken up into 64 MB or 128 MB chunks (user configurable)\n\n\nThese chunks are stored on data nodes and served up from there; \n\n\nThe central namenode manages block locations, the namespace information, and block placement policies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS provides a subset of POSIX semantics:\n\n\nRandom-access reads and non-random-access writes are fully supported. \n\n\nFsync and appends (after the file has been initially closed) are experimental and not available to OSG-based installs.\n\n\nRewriting closed files is not supported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop SE Components\n\n\nWe broadly break down the server components of the Hadoop SE into three categories: HDFS core, Grid extensions, and HDFS\nauxiliary. \nThe components in each of these categories are outlined below:\n\n\n\n\nHDFS Core:\n\n\nNamenode: The core metadata server of Hadoop. This is the most critical piece of the system, and there can only be one of these. This stores both the file system image and the file system journal. The namenode keeps all of the filesystem layout information (files, blocks, directories, permissions, etc) and the block locations. The filesystem layout is persisted on disk and the block locations are kept solely in memory. When a client opens a file, the namenode tells the client the locations of all the blocks in the file; the client then no longer needs to communicate with the namenode for data transfer.\n\n\nDatanode: This node stores copies of the blocks in HDFS. They communicate with the namenode to perform \"housekeeping\" such as creating new replicas, transferring blocks between datanodes, and deleting excess blocks. They also communicate with the clients to transfer data. To reach the best scalability, there should be as many datanodes as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrid extensions\n\n\nGlobus GridFTP: The standard GridFTP from Globus. We use a plug-in module (using the Globus Direct Storage Interface) that allows the GridFTP process to use the HDFS C-bindings directly.\n\n\nGratia probe: Gratia is an accounting system that records batch system and transfer records to a database. The records are collected by a client program called a \"probe\" which runs on the GridFTP or XRootD server.  The probe parses the GridFTP or XRootD logs and generates transfer records.\n\n\nXRootD server plugin: XRootD is an extremely flexible and powerful data server popular in the high energy physics community. There exists a HDFS plugin for XRootD; integrating with XRootD provides a means to export HDFS securely outside the local cluster, as another XRootD plugin provides GSI-based authentication and authorization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDFS auxiliary:\n\n\n\"Secondary Namenode\": Perhaps more aptly called a \"checkpoint server\". This server downloads the file system image and journal from the namenode, merges the two together, and uploads the new file system image up to the namenode. This is done on a different server in order to reduce the memory footprint of the namenode.\n\n\nHadoop Balancer: This is a script (unlike the others, which are daemons) that runs on the namenode. It requests transfers of random blocks between the datanodes. This works until all datanodes have approximately the same percentage of free space. Well-balanced datanodes are necessary for having a healthy cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the server components, there are two client components:\n\n\n\n\nFUSE: This allows HDFS to be mounted as a filesystem on the worker nodes. FUSE is a Linux kernel module that allows kernel I/O calls to be translated into a call to a userspace program. In this case, a program called fuse_dfs translates the POSIX calls into HDFS C-binding calls.\n\n\nHadoop Command Line Client: This command line client exposes a lot of the Unix-like calls without mounting FUSE, plus access to the non-POSIX calls (such as setting quotas and file replication levels). For example, \"hadoop fs -ls /\" is equivalent to \"ls /mnt/hadoop\" if /mnt/hadoop is the mount point of HDFS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamenode: We recommend at least 8GB of RAM (minimum is 2GB RAM), preferably 16GB or more. A rough rule of thumb is 1GB per 100TB of raw disk space; the actual requirements is around 1GB per million objects (files, directories, and blocks). The CPU requirements are any modern multi-core server CPU. Typically, the namenode will only use 2-5% of your CPU.\n\n\nAs this is a single point of failure, the \nmost important\n requirement is reliable hardware rather than high performance hardware. We suggest a node with redundant power supplies and at least 2 hard drives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary namenode: This node needs the same amount of RAM as the namenode for merging namespaces.

We currently utilize HDFS as a general-purpose file system. For this document,\nwe'll use the words \"Hadoop\" and \"HDFS\" interchangeably, but it's nice to know\nthe distinction.  The HDFS file system has several features, some of which differ a bit from a typical\nfile system:   Each file is broken up into 64 MB or 128 MB chunks (user configurable)  These chunks are stored on data nodes and served up from there;   The central namenode manages block locations, the namespace information, and block placement policies.     HDFS provides a subset of POSIX semantics:  Random-access reads and non-random-access writes are fully supported.   Fsync and appends (after the file has been initially closed) are experimental and not available to OSG-based installs.  Rewriting closed files is not supported",

            "text": "We broadly break down the server components of the Hadoop SE into three categories: HDFS core, Grid extensions, and HDFS\nauxiliary. \nThe components in each of these categories are outlined below:   HDFS Core:  Namenode: The core metadata server of Hadoop. This is the most critical piece of the system, and there can only be one of these. This stores both the file system image and the file system journal. The namenode keeps all of the filesystem layout information (files, blocks, directories, permissions, etc) and the block locations. The filesystem layout is persisted on disk and the block locations are kept solely in memory. When a client opens a file, the namenode tells the client the locations of all the blocks in the file; the client then no longer needs to communicate with the namenode for data transfer.  Datanode: This node stores copies of the blocks in HDFS. They communicate with the namenode to perform \"housekeeping\" such as creating new replicas, transferring blocks between datanodes, and deleting excess blocks. They also communicate with the clients to transfer data. To reach the best scalability, there should be as many datanodes as possible.    Grid extensions  Globus GridFTP: The standard GridFTP from Globus. We use a plug-in module (using the Globus Direct Storage Interface) that allows the GridFTP process to use the HDFS C-bindings directly.  Gratia probe: Gratia is an accounting system that records batch system and transfer records to a database. The records are collected by a client program called a \"probe\" which runs on the GridFTP or XRootD server.  The probe parses the GridFTP or XRootD logs and generates transfer records.  XRootD server plugin: XRootD is an extremely flexible and powerful data server popular in the high energy physics community. There exists a HDFS plugin for XRootD; integrating with XRootD provides a means to export HDFS securely outside the local cluster, as another XRootD plugin provides GSI-based authentication and authorization.    HDFS auxiliary:  \"Secondary Namenode\": Perhaps more aptly called a \"checkpoint server\". This server downloads the file system image and journal from the namenode, merges the two together, and uploads the new file system image up to the namenode. This is done on a different server in order to reduce the memory footprint of the namenode.  Hadoop Balancer: This is a script (unlike the others, which are daemons) that runs on the namenode. It requests transfers of random blocks between the datanodes. This works until all datanodes have approximately the same percentage of free space. Well-balanced datanodes are necessary for having a healthy cluster.     In addition to the server components, there are two client components:   FUSE: This allows HDFS to be mounted as a filesystem on the worker nodes. FUSE is a Linux kernel module that allows kernel I/O calls to be translated into a call to a userspace program. In this case, a program called fuse_dfs translates the POSIX calls into HDFS C-binding calls.  Hadoop Command Line Client: This command line client exposes a lot of the Unix-like calls without mounting FUSE, plus access to the non-POSIX calls (such as setting quotas and file replication levels). For example, \"hadoop fs -ls /\" is equivalent to \"ls /mnt/hadoop\" if /mnt/hadoop is the mount point of HDFS.     Namenode: We recommend at least 8GB of RAM (minimum is 2GB RAM), preferably 16GB or more. A rough rule of thumb is 1GB per 100TB of raw disk space; the actual requirements is around 1GB per million objects (files, directories, and blocks). The CPU requirements are any modern multi-core server CPU. Typically, the namenode will only use 2-5% of your CPU.  As this is a single point of failure, the  most important  requirement is reliable hardware rather than high performance hardware. We suggest a node with redundant power supplies and at least 2 hard drives.    Secondary namenode: This node needs the same amount of RAM as the namenode for merging namespaces. It does not need to be high performance or high reliability.  Datanode: Each datanode should plan to dedicate about 1-1.5 GB of RAM to HDFS. A general rule of thumb is to dedicate 1 CPU to HDFS per 5TB of disk capacity under heavily load; clusters with moderate load (i.e., mostly sequential workflows) will need less. At idle, HDFS will consume almost no CPU.",

However, in most cases, you can do the configuration once and copy it to all nodes in the cluster (possibly using your favorite configuration management tool). Special configuration for various special components is given in the below sections.\n\n\nHadoop configuration is stored in \n/etc/hadoop/conf\n. However, by default, these files are mostly blank. OSG provides a sample configuration in \n/etc/hadoop/conf.osg\n with most common values filled in. You will need to copy these into \n/etc/hadoop/conf\n before they become active. Please let us know if there are any common values that should be added/changed across the whole grid. You will likely need to modify \nhdfs-site.xml\n and \ncore-site.xml\n.

(Otherwise, be sure to \nchown\n your storage directory to hdfs after running):\n\n\nhadoop namenode -format\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will initialize the storage directory on your NameNode\n\n\n(optional) FUSE Client Configuration\n\n\nA FUSE mount is required on any node that you would like to use standard POSIX-like commands on the Hadoop filesystem. FUSE (or \"File system in User SpacE\") is a way to access HDFS using typical UNIX directory commands (i.e., POSIX-like access). Note that not all advanced functions of a full POSIX-compliant file system are necessarily available.\n\n\nFUSE is typically installed as part of this installation, but, if you are running a customized or non-standard system, make sure that the fuse kernel module is installed and loaded with \nmodprobe fuse\n.\n\n\nYou can add the FUSE to be mounted at boot time by adding the following line to \n/etc/fstab\n:\n\n\nhadoop-fuse-dfs# \n/MNT/HADOOP\n fuse server=\nNAMENODE.HOST\n,port=9000,rdbuffer=131072,allow_other 0 0\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to change the \n/MNT/HADOOP\n mount point and \nNAMENODE.HOST\n to match your local configuration. To match the help documents, we recommend using \n/MNT/HADOOP\n as your mountpoint.\n\n\nOnce your \n/etc/fstab\n is updated, to mount FUSE run:\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop\n\nroot@host #\n mount /mnt/hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen mounting the HDFS FUSE mount, you will see the following harmless warnings printed to the screen:\n\n\n#\n mount /mnt/hadoop\n\nINFO fuse_options.c:162 Adding FUSE arg /mnt/hadoop\n\n\nINFO fuse_options.c:110 Ignoring option allow_other\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have troubles mounting FUSE refer to \nRunning FUSE in Debug Mode\n in the Troubleshooting section.\n\n\nCreating VO and User Areas\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nGrid Users are needed by GridFTP nodes. VO areas are common to all nodes.\n\n\n\n\nFor this package to function correctly, you will have to create the users needed for grid operation. Any user that can be authenticated should be created.\n\n\nFor grid-mapfile users, each line of the grid-mapfile is a certificate/user pair. Each user in this file should be created on the server.\n\n\nNote that these users must be kept in sync with the authentication method.\n\n\nPrior to starting basic day-to-day operations, it is important to create dedicated areas for each VO and/or user. This is similar to user management in simple UNIX filesystems. Create (and maintain) usernames and groups with UIDs and GIDs on \nall nodes\n. These are maintained in basic system files such as \n/etc/passwd\n and \n/etc/group\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn the examples below It is assumed a FUSE mount is set to \n/mnt/hadoop\n. As an alternative \nhadoop fs\n commands could have been used.\n\n\n\n\nFor clean HDFS operations and filesystem management:\n\n\n(a) Create top-level VO subdirectories under \n/mnt/hadoop\n.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/cms\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/dzero\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/sbgrid\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/fermigrid\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/cmstest\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir /mnt/hadoop/osg\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Create individual top-level user areas, under each VO area, as needed.\n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/tanyalevshina\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/michaelthomas\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/brianbockelman\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/douglasstrain\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/abhisheksinghrana\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Adjust username:group ownership of each area.\n\n\nroot@host #\n chown -R cms:cms /mnt/hadoop/cms\n\nroot@host #\n chown -R sam:sam /mnt/hadoop/dzero\n\n\nroot@host #\n chown -R michaelthomas:cms /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/michaelthomas\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP Configuration\n\n\ngridftp-hdfs reads the Hadoop configuration file to learn how to talk to Hadoop.\nBy now, you should have followed the instruction for installing hadoop as detailed in the previous section as well as\ncreated the proper users/directories.\n\n\nThe default settings in \n/etc/gridftp.conf\n along with \n/etc/gridftp.d/gridftp-hdfs.conf\n are used by the init.d script\nand should be ok for most installations.\nThe file \n/etc/gridftp-hdfs/gridftp-debug.conf\n is used by \n/usr/bin/gridftp-hdfs-standalone\n for starting up the\nGridFTP server in a testing mode.\nAny additional config files under \n/etc/gridftp.d\n will be used for both the init.d and standalone GridFTP server.\n\n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n contains additional site-specific environment variables that are used by the gridftp-hdfs\nDSI module in both the init.d and standalone GridFTP server.\nSome of the environment variables that can be used in \n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption Name\n\n\nNeeds Editing?\n\n\nSuggested value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_HDFS_REPLICA_MAP\n\n\nNo\n\n\nFile containing a list of paths and replica values for setting the default # of replicas for specific file paths\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_BUFFER_COUNT\n\n\nNo\n\n\nThe number of 1MB memory buffers used to reorder data streams before writing them to Hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_FILE_BUFFER_COUNT\n\n\nNo\n\n\nThe number of 1MB file-based buffers used to reorder data streams before writing them to Hadoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_SYSLOG\n\n\nNo\n\n\nSet this to 1 in case if you want to send transfer activity data to syslog (only used for the HadoopViz application)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_HDFS_CHECKSUMS\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nList of checksum calculations to perform on-the-fly (default: \n\"MD5,ADLER32,CRC32,CKSUM,CVMFS\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_HDFS_MOUNT_POINT\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nThe location of the FUSE mount point used during the Hadoop installation. Defaults to /mnt/hadoop. This is needed so that gridftp-hdfs can convert fuse paths on the incoming URL to native Hadoop paths. \nNote:\n this does not imply you need FUSE mounted on GridFTP nodes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRIDFTP_LOAD_LIMIT\n\n\nNo\n\n\nGridFTP will refuse to start new transfers if the load on the GridFTP host is higher than this number; defaults to 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTMPDIR\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nThe temp directory where the file-based buffers are stored. Defaults to /tmp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n is also a good place to increase per-process resource limits. For example, many installations will require more than the default number of open files (\nulimit -n\n).\n\n\nLastly, you will need to configure an authentication mechanism for GridFTP.\n\n\nConfiguring authentication\n\n\nFor information on how to configure authentication for your GridFTP installation, please refer to the \nconfiguring authentication section of the GridFTP guide\n.\n\n\nGridFTP Gratia Transfer Probe Configuration\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNeeded by GridFTP node only.\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nGridFTP documentation\n for configuration details.\n\n\nHadoop Storage Probe Configuration\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis is only needed by the Hadoop NameNode\n\n\n\n\nHere are the most relevant file and directory locations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nNeeds Editing?\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbe Configuration\n\n\nYes\n\n\n/etc/gratia/hadoop-storage/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbe Executable\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/usr/share/gratia/hadoop-storage/hadoop_storage_probe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog files\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/var/log/gratia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporary files\n\n\nNo\n\n\n/var/lib/gratia/tmp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RPM installs the Gratia probe into the system crontab, but does not configure it. The configuration of the probe is controlled by two files\n\n\n/etc/gratia/hadoop-storage/ProbeConfig\n/etc/gratia/hadoop-storage/storage.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\nProbeConfig\n\n\nThis is usually one XML node spread over multiple lines. Note that comments (#) have no effect on this file. You will need to edit the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\n\n\nNeeds Editing\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollectorHost\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nSet to the hostname and port of the central collector. By default it sends to the OSG collector. You probably do not want to change it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiteName\n\n\nYes\n\n\nSet to the resource group name of your SE as registered in OIM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrid\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\nSet to \"ITB\" if this is a test resource; otherwise, leave as OSG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnableProbe\n\n\nYes\n\n\nSet to 1 to enable the probe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstorage.cfg\n\n\nThis file controls which paths in HDFS should be monitored. This is in the Windows INI format.\n\n\nNote: for the current version of the storage.cfg, there is an error, and you may need to delete the \"probe/\" subdirectory for the ProbeConfig location\n\n\nProbeConfig = /etc/gratia/probe/hadoop-storage/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each logical \"area\" (arbitrarily defined by you), specify both a given name and a list of paths that belong to that area. Unix globs are accepted.\n\n\nTo configure an area named \"CMS /store\" that monitors the space usage in the paths /user/cms/store/*, one would add the following to the storage.cfg file.\n\n\n[Area CMS /store]\nName = CMS /store\nPath = /user/cms/store/*\nTrim = /user/cms\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each such area, add a section to your configuration file.\n\n\nExample file\n\n\nBelow is a configuration file that includes three distinct areas. Note that you shouldn't have to touch the [Gratia] section if you edited the ProbeConfig above:\n\n\n[Gratia]\ngratia_location = /opt/vdt/gratia\nProbeConfig = %(gratia_location)s/probe/hadoop-storage/ProbeConfig\n\n[Area /store]\nName = CMS /store\nPath = /store/*\n\n[Area /store/user]\nName = CMS /store/user\nPath = /store/user/*\n\n[Area /user]\nName = Hadoop /user\nPath = /user/*\n\n\n\n\n\n*\nNOTE These lines in the [gratia] section are wrong and need to be changed to the following by hand for now until the rpm is updated:\n\n\ngratia_location = /etc/gratia\nProbeConfig = %(gratia_location)s/hadoop-storage/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning Services\n\n\nStart the services in the order listed and stop them in reverse order.

common questions/concerns\n\n\nFUSE\n\n\nNotes on Building a FUSE Module\n\n\nIf you are running a custom kernel, then be sure to enable the \nfuse\n module with \nCONFIG_FUSE_FS=m\n in your kernel config. Building and installing a \nfuse\n kernel module for your custom kernel is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\nRunning FUSE in Debug Mode\n\n\nTo start the FUSE mount in debug mode, you can run the FUSE mount command by hand:\n\n\nroot@host #\n  /usr/bin/hadoop-fuse-dfs  /mnt/hadoop -o rw,server\n=\nNAMENODE.HOST\n,port\n=\n9000\n,rdbuffer\n=\n131072\n,allow_other -d\n\n\n\n\n\nChange \nNAMENODE.HOSTNAME\n for the hostname of your Primary NameNode. Debug output will be printed to stderr, which\nyou will probably want to redirect to a file. Most FUSE-related problems can be tackled by reading through the stderr and looking for error messages.\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nStarting GridFTP in Standalone Mode\n\n\nIf you would like to test the gridftp-hdfs server in a debug standalone mode, you can run the command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n gridftp-hdfs-standalone\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standalone server runs on port 5002, handles a single GridFTP request, and will log output to stdout/stderr.\n\n\nFile Locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\n\nFile Type\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nNeeds editing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadoop\n\n\nLog files\n\n\n/var/log/hadoop/*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPID files\n\n\n/var/run/hadoop/*.pid\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninit scripts\n\n\n/etc/init.d/hadoop\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninit script config file\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/hadoop\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nruntime config files\n\n\n/etc/hadoop/conf/*\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem binaries\n\n\n/usr/bin/hadoop\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJARs\n\n\n/usr/lib/hadoop/*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nruntime config files\n\n\n/etc/hosts_exclude\n\n\nYes, must be present on NameNodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog files\n\n\n/var/log/gridftp-auth.log\n, \n/var/log/gridftp.log\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGridFTP\n\n\nTransfer log\n\n\n/var/log/gridftp.log\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication log\n\n\n/var/log/gridftp-auth.log\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLCMAPS auth error log\n\n\n/var/log/messages\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninit.d script\n\n\n/etc/init.d/globus-gridftp-server\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nruntime config files\n\n\n/etc/gridftp-hdfs/*\n, \n/etc/sysconfig/gridftp-hdfs\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem binaries\n\n\n/usr/bin/gridftp-hdfs-standalone\n, \n/usr/sbin/globus-gridftp-server\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem libraries\n\n\n/usr/lib64/libglobus_gridftp_server_hdfs.so*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLCMAPS VOMS configuration\n\n\n/etc/lcmaps.db\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCA certificates\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/certificates/*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nReplicas\n\n\nYou may need to change the following line in \n/usr/share/gridftp-hdfs/gridftp-hdfs-environment\n:\n\n\nexport GRIDFTP_HDFS_REPLICAS=2\n\n\n\n\n\ncopyFromLocal java IOException\n\n\nWhen trying to copy a local file into Hadoop you may come across the following java exception:\n\n\n\n  \nShow detailed java exception\n\n    \n\n\n11/06/24 11:10:50 WARN hdfs.DFSClient: Error Recovery for block null bad datanode[0]\n\n\nnodes == null\n\n\n11/06/24 11:10:50 WARN hdfs.DFSClient: Could not get block locations.

FUSE (or \"File system in User SpacE\") is a way to access HDFS using typical UNIX directory commands (i.e., POSIX-like access). Note that not all advanced functions of a full POSIX-compliant file system are necessarily available.  FUSE is typically installed as part of this installation, but, if you are running a customized or non-standard system, make sure that the fuse kernel module is installed and loaded with  modprobe fuse .  You can add the FUSE to be mounted at boot time by adding the following line to  /etc/fstab :  hadoop-fuse-dfs#  /MNT/HADOOP  fuse server= NAMENODE.HOST ,port=9000,rdbuffer=131072,allow_other 0 0  Be sure to change the  /MNT/HADOOP  mount point and  NAMENODE.HOST  to match your local configuration. To match the help documents, we recommend using  /MNT/HADOOP  as your mountpoint.  Once your  /etc/fstab  is updated, to mount FUSE run:  root@host #  mkdir /mnt/hadoop root@host #  mount /mnt/hadoop  When mounting the HDFS FUSE mount, you will see the following harmless warnings printed to the screen:  #  mount /mnt/hadoop INFO fuse_options.c:162 Adding FUSE arg /mnt/hadoop  INFO fuse_options.c:110 Ignoring option allow_other   If you have troubles mounting FUSE refer to  Running FUSE in Debug Mode  in the Troubleshooting section.",

For this package to function correctly, you will have to create the users needed for grid operation. Any user that can be authenticated should be created.  For grid-mapfile users, each line of the grid-mapfile is a certificate/user pair. Each user in this file should be created on the server.  Note that these users must be kept in sync with the authentication method.  Prior to starting basic day-to-day operations, it is important to create dedicated areas for each VO and/or user. This is similar to user management in simple UNIX filesystems. Create (and maintain) usernames and groups with UIDs and GIDs on  all nodes . These are maintained in basic system files such as  /etc/passwd  and  /etc/group .   Note  In the examples below It is assumed a FUSE mount is set to  /mnt/hadoop . As an alternative  hadoop fs  commands could have been used.   For clean HDFS operations and filesystem management:  (a) Create top-level VO subdirectories under  /mnt/hadoop .  Example:  root@host #  mkdir /mnt/hadoop/cms root@host #  mkdir /mnt/hadoop/dzero root@host #  mkdir /mnt/hadoop/sbgrid root@host #  mkdir /mnt/hadoop/fermigrid root@host #  mkdir /mnt/hadoop/cmstest root@host #  mkdir /mnt/hadoop/osg  (b) Create individual top-level user areas, under each VO area, as needed.  root@host #  mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/tanyalevshina root@host #  mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/michaelthomas root@host #  mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/brianbockelman root@host #  mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/douglasstrain root@host #  mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/abhisheksinghrana  (c) Adjust username:group ownership of each area.  root@host #  chown -R cms:cms /mnt/hadoop/cms root@host #  chown -R sam:sam /mnt/hadoop/dzero root@host #  chown -R michaelthomas:cms /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/michaelthomas",

            "text": "Configuring an HTCondor Submit Host to Send Jobs to the OSG\n\n\nThis document explains how to add a path for user jobs to flow from your local site out to the OSG,\nwhich in most cases means that the jobs will have far more resources available to run on than locally.\nIf your local batch system frequently has many jobs waiting to run for a long time,\nyou do not have a local batch system,\nor if you simply want to provide a local entry point for OSG-bound jobs,\nadding a path to OSG may result in less waiting for your users.\n\n\nNote that if you do not have a local batch system, consider having your users use\n\nOSG Connect\n, which will require less\ninfrastructure work at your site.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFlocking to the OSG requires some modification to user workflows.\nAfter installation, see the \nusage\n section for instructions on what your users will need to do.\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nEvery batch computing system has one or more entry points that users log on to and use to hand over their computing work\nto the batch system for completion.\nFor the HTCondor batch system, we say that users log on to a submit host to submit their jobs to HTCondor,\nwhere the jobs wait (\"are queued\") until computing resources are available to run them.\nIn a purely local HTCondor system, there are one to a few submit hosts and many computing resources.\n\n\nAn HTCondor submit host can also be configured to forward excess jobs to an OSG-managed pool.\nThis process is called \nflocking\n.\nIf you already have an HTCondor pool, we recommend that you install this software\non top of one of your existing HTCondor submit hosts.\nThis approach allows a user to submit locally and have their jobs run locally or,\nif the user chooses and if local resources are unavailable, have their jobs automatically flock to OSG.\nIf you do not have an HTCondor batch system, following these instructions will install the HTCondor submit service\nand configure it only to forward jobs to the OSG.\nIn other words, you do not need a whole HTCondor batch system just to have a local OSG submit host.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBecause jobs running in OSG run in a completely different environment than your local cluster,\nand require additional considerations for data movement,\nyou or your campus will need to provide additional support for your users to enable them to\nproperly use OSG.\nSend email to \n saying that you would like to flock jobs to OSG,\nand we will consult with you about the proper solution for your site and what needs to be set up\nat both the OSG and at your site.\n\n\nAlso consider the following technical requirements:\n\n\n\n\nOperating system:\n A RHEL 6 or 7 compatible operating system.\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If it does not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user ID \ncondor\n.\n\n\nHost certificate:\n Recommended for authentication to OSG infrastructure.\n  See our \ndocumentation\n for instructions on how to request and install host certificates.\n\n\nNetwork:\n \n\n\nInbound TCP port 9618 must be open.\n\n\nThe submit host must have a public IP address with both forward and reverse DNS configured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInitial Steps\n\n\nRegister your submit host in OSG Topology\n\n\nTo be part of OSG, your submit host should be registered with the OSG.\nYou will need information like the hostname, and the administrative and security contacts.\nFollow the \ngeneral registration instructions\n.\nThe service type is \nSubmit Node\n.\n\n\nChoose your authentication method\n\n\nThere are two options for authentication of your submit host to the OSG: GSI and pool password.\nOf these, GSI is the recommended method, but it will require obtaining a host certificate for your submit host.\nSee our \ndocumentation\n for instructions on how to request and install host certificates.\n\n\nIf you are unable to obtain a host certificate, use the \"pool password\" authentication method,\n\ndescribed in the Configuring Authentication section\n.\n\n\nRequest to be allowed to flock to OSG\n\n\nOSG staff will need to add your submit host to the list of hosts that flocked jobs are accepted from.\nSend email to \n with the hostname of your submit host and request to be added to the list.\n\n\nInstalling Required Software\n\n\nFlocking requires HTCondor software as well as software for reporting to the OSG accounting system.\nOSG provides a convenience RPM that installs all required packages.\nTo install, run:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-flock\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Reporting via Gratia\n\n\nReporting to the OSG accounting system is done using the \nGratia\n service, which consists of multiple \nprobes\n.\nHTCondor uses the \"condor\" probe, which is configured in \n/etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n;\nwe provide a recommended configuration for flocking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy over the recommended probe configuration:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cp /etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig-flocking /etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the value for \nProbeName\n with the hostname of your submit host, with the following format:\n\n\nProbeName=\ncondor:\nHOSTNAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the value for \nSiteName\n with the Resource Name you registered in Topology (see\n   \ninstructions above\n).\n   For example:\n\n\nSiteName=\nOSG_US_EXAMPLE_SUBMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the Gratia Probe.\n\n\nEnableProbe=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the section \nTitle2\n make sure to set the following (if not already there):\n\n\nMapUnknownToGroup=\n1\n\nMapGroupToRole=\n1\n\nVOOverride=\nOSG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Authentication\n\n\nIf you have obtained a host certificate according to the \ninstructions\n,\nyou do not need to do any additional configuration and may \ncontinue to the next section\n.\n\n\nIf you cannot obtain a host certificate, then configure pool password authentication via the following instructions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend email to \n requesting the pool password file for flocking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove the pool password file you have received to \n/etc/condor/pool_password\n;\n   set the ownership of that file to \ncondor:condor\n and the permissions to \n0600\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a configration file named \n/etc/condor/config.d/90-flock-pool-password.conf\n with the following contents:\n\n\n#-- Flock to OSG using pool password\n\n\nSEC_PASSWORD_FILE\n \n=\n \n/etc/condor/pool_password\n\n\nSEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS\n \n=\n \nFS,PASSWORD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging Services\n\n\nIn addition to the HTCondor service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation. The specific services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch CRL\n\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n and \nfetch-crl-cron\n\n\nSee \nCA documentation\n for more info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGratia\n\n\ngratia-probes-cron\n\n\nAccounting software\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTcondor\n\n\ncondor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table gives the commands needed to start, stop, enable, and disable a service:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo...\n\n\nOn EL6, run the command...\n\n\nOn EL7, run the command...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a service\n\n\nservice \nSERVICE-NAME\n start\n\n\nsystemctl start \nSERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop a service\n\n\nservice \nSERVICE-NAME\n stop\n\n\nsystemctl stop \nSERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable a service to start on boot\n\n\nchkconfig \nSERVICE-NAME\n on\n\n\nsystemctl enable \nSERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable a service from starting on boot\n\n\nchkconfig \nSERVICE-NAME\n off\n\n\nsystemctl disable \nSERVICE-NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRunning jobs in OSG\n\n\nIf your users are accustomed to running jobs locally, they may encounter some significant differences when running jobs in OSG.\nUsers should be aware that OSG jobs are distributed across multiple institutions across a large geographical area.\nEach institution will have its own policy about the kinds of jobs that are allowed to run,\nand data transfer may be more complicated.\nThe \nOSG Helpdesk Solutions\n page has information about\nwhat users should know; the \"Choosing Resources for Jobs\" and \"Data Management\" sections are particularly relevant.\n\n\nSpecifying a project\n\n\nOSG will only run jobs that have a registered \nproject\n associated with them.\nUsers must follow the\n\ninstructions for starting a project in OSG-Connect\n\nto register a project.\n\n\nA project is associated with a job by adding a ProjectName line to the user's submit file.\nFor example:\n\n\n+ProjectName = \nMy_Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe double quotes are necessary.\n\n\nGet Help\n\n\nIf you need help with setup or troubleshooting, see our \nhelp procedure\n.",

You'll be prompted for the password you used to create the certificate. The invocation assumes that the PKCS12 file is called \nusercred.p12\n.  After running, the PEM certificate will be written to \nusercert.pem\n. \n\n\nuser@host $\n openssl pkcs12 -in usercred.p12 -out usercert.pem -nodes -clcerts -nokeys\n\nEnter Import Password:\n\n\nMAC verified OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, extract the private key by running the following command. You'll be prompted for two different passwords.  The first prompt will be for the password that you used to create the certficate.  The second prompt will be for the password that will encrypt the PEM certificate that will be created.  As before, the invocation assumes that your PKCS12 certificate is located in \nusercred.p12\n. After running, the PEM certificate with your private key will be written to \nuserkey.pem\n.\n\n\nuser@host $\n openssl pkcs12 -in usercred.p12 -out userkey.pem  -nocerts\n\nEnter Import Password:\n\n\nMAC verified OK\n\n\nEnter PEM pass phrase:\n\n\nVerifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevoking Your User Certificate\n\n\nIf the security of your certificate or private key has been compromised, you have a responsibility to revoke the certificate.\nIn addition, if your name or email address changes, you must revoke your certificate and get a new one with the correct\ninformation.\n\n\nIf you have a CILogon issued certificate, contact \nca@cilogon.org\n in order revoke your certificate.\nIf you received a certificate from another CA, please contact the CA to intiate a certificate revocation.\n\n\nGetting a Certificate from a Service Provider with cigetcert\n\n\nYou may also get a user certificate from a SAML 2.0 Service Provider such as your home institution or XSEDE.\nThis kind of certificate is short-lived, typically valid only for a week.\nTherefore it is not suitable for using in your browser.\nHowever, it is useful for command-line access to site services such as compute or storage.\n\n\nYou will need to use the \ncigetcert\n tool to get a certificate this way.\nUse yum to install the \ncigetcert\n package from the OSG repositories.\n\n\nThis is a new way of getting a certificate and does not work with all institutions.\nTo get a list of institutions supported by \ncigetcert\n, run:\n\n\nuser@host $\n cigetcert --listinstitutions\n\nClemson University\n\n\nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory\n\n\nLIGO Scientific Collaboration\n\n\nLTER Network\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a certificate, run\n\n\nuser@host $\n cigetcert -i \nINSTITUTION\n\n\nAuthorizing ...... authorized\n\n\nFetching certificate ..... fetched\n\n\nStoring certificate in /tmp/x509up_u46142\n\n\nYour certificate is valid until: Fri Apr 13 17:03:13 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication is controlled by the institution;\ndepending on the institution, you may need a valid Kerberos token, or will be prompted for a password.\n\n\nIf all goes well, you should see output similar to what's above.\nThe certificate is created in \n/tmp/x509up_u\nYOUR UID\n, which is the same place proxies are created by \ngrid-proxy-init\n.\n\n\nYou may specify default arguments in the \nCIGETCERTOPTS\n environment variable.\nThis can save you from having to type in the entire institution name every time you want a cert.\nFor example, to always use FNAL as the institution, put this in your \n.bashrc\n:\n\n\nexport\n \nCIGETCERTOPTS\n=\n-i \nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour VO may also provide specific instructions for how to best use this tool.\nContact your VO support center for details.\n\n\nFinally, \ncigetcert\n has advanced features, such as the ability to load configuration from a server, or store the cert on a MyProxy server.\nSee the \nmanual page for cigetcert\n for more information.\n\n\nUsing cigetcert with XSEDE credentials\n\n\ncigetcert\n also works with XSEDE as the service provider.\nTo use XSEDE credentials, you will first need an account at \nhttps://portal.xsede.org\n.\nIn addition, you \nneed\n to set up two-factor authentication with XSEDE; see their \nMFA documentation\n for details.\nPush notifications using the Duo Mobile app are required.\n\n\nOnce you have set all those up, run \ncigetcert\n as follows:\n\n\nuser@host $\n cigetcert -u \nUSERNAME\n -i XSEDE\n\n\n\n\n\nUSERNAME\n is your username at portal.xsede.org.\nYou will get prompted to \"Enter XSEDE Kerberos Password.\"\nEnter the password for your account at portal.xsede.org.\nYou should then get a 2FA authentication request with Duo Mobile; once you accept this, \ncigetcert\n will issue the certificate.\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nTo get assistance, please use the \nthis page\n.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nUseful Documentation.OpenSSL commands (from NCSA)\n - e.g. how to convert the format of your certificate.\n\n\nManual page for cigetcert",

You'll be prompted for the password you used to create the certificate. The invocation assumes that the PKCS12 file is called  usercred.p12 .  After running, the PEM certificate will be written to  usercert.pem .   user@host $  openssl pkcs12 -in usercred.p12 -out usercert.pem -nodes -clcerts -nokeys Enter Import Password:  MAC verified OK     Second, extract the private key by running the following command. You'll be prompted for two different passwords.  The first prompt will be for the password that you used to create the certficate.  The second prompt will be for the password that will encrypt the PEM certificate that will be created.  As before, the invocation assumes that your PKCS12 certificate is located in  usercred.p12 . After running, the PEM certificate with your private key will be written to  userkey.pem .  user@host $  openssl pkcs12 -in usercred.p12 -out userkey.pem  -nocerts Enter Import Password:  MAC verified OK  Enter PEM pass phrase:  Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:",

You will need to use the  cigetcert  tool to get a certificate this way.\nUse yum to install the  cigetcert  package from the OSG repositories.  This is a new way of getting a certificate and does not work with all institutions.\nTo get a list of institutions supported by  cigetcert , run:  user@host $  cigetcert --listinstitutions Clemson University  Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory  LIGO Scientific Collaboration  LTER Network  ...

If all goes well, you should see output similar to what's above.\nThe certificate is created in  /tmp/x509up_u YOUR UID , which is the same place proxies are created by  grid-proxy-init .  You may specify default arguments in the  CIGETCERTOPTS  environment variable.\nThis can save you from having to type in the entire institution name every time you want a cert.\nFor example, to always use FNAL as the institution, put this in your  .bashrc :  export   CIGETCERTOPTS = -i  Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory   Your VO may also provide specific instructions for how to best use this tool.\nContact your VO support center for details.

Most users will want the \nCA overview\n,\n\nhost certificate overview\n, or \nuser certificate overview\n documents.\n\n\n\n\nOSG PKI Command Line Clients\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe OSG PKI Command Line Clients provide a command-line interface for requesting and issuing host certificates from the OSG PKI. They complement the \nOIM Web Interface\n.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nIf you have not already done so, you need to \nconfigure the OSG software repositories\n.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nThe command-line scripts have been packaged as an RPM and are available from the OSG repositories.\n\n\nTo install the RPM, run:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install osg-pki-tools\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nDocumentation for usage of the osg-pki-tools can be found \nhere\n\n\nOSG CA Certificates Updater\n\n\nThis section explains the installation and use of \nosg-ca-certs-updater\n, a package that provides automatic updates of\nCA certificates.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstall instructions\n\n\nRun the following command to install the latest version of the updater.\n\n\nroot@host#\n yum install osg-ca-certs-updater\n\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\n\nStarting and Enabling Services\n\n\nRun the following to enable the updater. This will persist until the machine is rebooted.\n\n\nroot@host#\n service osg-ca-certs-updater-cron start\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following to enable the updater when the machine is rebooted.\n\n\nroot@host#\n chkconfig osg-ca-certs-updater-cron on\n\n\n\n\n\nRun both commands if you wish for the service to activate immediately and remain active throughout reboots.\n\n\nStopping and Disabling Services\n\n\nEnter the following to disable the updater.

This entry is located in the file \n/etc/cron.d/osg-ca-certs-updater\n. Please see the Unix manual page for \ncrontab\n in section 5 for an explanation of the format. The manual page can be accessed by the command \nman 5 crontab\n. The valid command-line arguments can be listed by running \nosg-ca-certs-updater --help\n. Reasonable defaults have been provided, namely:\n\n\n\n\nAttempt an update no more often than every 23 hours. Due to the random wait (see below), having a 24-hour minimum time between updates would cause the update time to slowly slide back every day.\n\n\nRun the script every 6 hours. We run the script more often than we update so that downtime at the wrong moment does not cause the update to be delayed for a full day.\n\n\nDelay for a random amount of time up to 30 minutes before updating, to reduce load spikes on OSG repositories.\n\n\nDo not warn the administrator about update failures that have happened less than 72 hours since the last successful update.\n\n\nLog errors only.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nUseful configuration and log files\n\n\nConfiguration file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-ca-certs-updater\n\n\nCron entry for periodically launching the updater\n\n\n/etc/cron.d/osg-ca-certs-updater\n\n\nCommand-line arguments to the updater can be specified here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosg-release\n\n\nRepo definition files for production OSG repositories\n\n\n/etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo\n or \n/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-el6.repo\n\n\nMake sure these repositories are enabled and reachable from the host you are trying to update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog files\n\n\nLogging is performed to the console by default.

This page provides the instructions on using this command. It provides status commands that allows you to list the CAs and the validity of the CAs and CRLs included in the installation. The manage commands allow you to fetch CAs and CRLs, change the distribution URL, as well as add and remove CAs from your local installation.\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\nDocumentation for usage of the osg-ca-manage tool can be found \nhere\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThese commands will not work if of the osg-ca-certs (or igtf-ca-certs) RPM packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\nInstall a certificate authority package\n\n\nBefore you proceed to install a Certificate Authority Package you should decide which of the available packages to install.\n\n\n\n\nosg\n, the package recommended to be used by production resources on the OSG. It is based on the CA distribution from the IGTF, but it may differ slightly as decided by the \nSecurity Team\n.\n\n\nigtf\n, the package is a redistribution of the unchanged CA distribution from the IGTF\n\n\nurl\n a package provided at a given URL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf in doubt, please consult the policies of your home institution and get in contact with the \nSecurity Team\n.\n\n\n\n\nNext decide at what location to install the Certificate Authority Package:\n\n\n\n\non the \nroot\n file system in a system directory \n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n\nin a \ncustom\n directory that can also be shared\n\n\n\n\nSetup the CA certificates\n\n\nThe Certificate Authority Package is preferably be used by grid users without root privileges \nor\n if the CA certificates will not be shared by other installations on the same host.\n\n\nroot@host #\n osg-ca-manage setupca --location root --url osg\n\nSetting CA Certificates for at \n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n\n\nSetup completed successfully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a successful installation the certificates will be installed in (\n/etc/grid-security/certificates\n in this example).

Reasonable defaults have been provided, namely:   Attempt an update no more often than every 23 hours. Due to the random wait (see below), having a 24-hour minimum time between updates would cause the update time to slowly slide back every day.  Run the script every 6 hours. We run the script more often than we update so that downtime at the wrong moment does not cause the update to be delayed for a full day.  Delay for a random amount of time up to 30 minutes before updating, to reduce load spikes on OSG repositories.  Do not warn the administrator about update failures that have happened less than 72 hours since the last successful update.  Log errors only.",

The timer may fail\nwithout warnings if the service does not run correctly.\n\n\n\n\nPre- and post-renewal hooks\n\n\ncertbot\n provides the ability to run scripts before and/or after certificate renewal via command hooks.\nCommon uses for these hooks include:\n\n\n\n\nCopying the renewed certificate so that it can be used for a separate service (such as XRootD)\n\n\nShutting down and restarting a service running on port 80\n\n\nTemporarily opening up the firewall\n\n\n\n\nTo do this, call \ncertbot\n with \n--pre-hook \nCOMMAND\n for a command or script to run before renewal,\nand \n--post-hook \nCOMMAND\n for a command or script to run after renewal.\nThe command(s) will only be run if the certificate is actually renewed.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThis example is for a host running CEView and XRootD standalone;\nCEView needs to be stopped so it doesn't block port 80, and XRootD needs its certificate in a separate location.\n\n\nCreate the following scripts:\n\n\n/root/bin/certbot-pre.sh\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncondor_ce_off -daemon CEVIEW\n\n\n\n\n\n/root/bin/certbot-post.sh\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\ncd\n /etc/grid-security\ncp -f hostcert.pem

\ncertbot.service\n file that you created \nabove\n and add the \n--pre-hook \nCOMMAND\n\nand \n--post-hook \nCOMMAND\n arguments to the \nExecStart\n line:\n\n\nExecStart\n=\n/usr/bin/certbot renew

certificate with the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n certbot-auto renew\n\n\n\n\n\nThe certificate will be renewed if it is close to expiring.\n\n\n\n\nDisable services listening on port 80\n\n\n\n\nJust like with obtaining a new certificate, renewing a certificate requires you to temporarily disable\n   services running on port 80 so that \ncertbot-auto\n can verify the host.\n\n\nAutomating renewals using cron\n\n\nTo automate renewal using cron, create a cron job in \n/etc/cron.d/certbot-renew\n with the following contents:\n\n\n* */2 * * * root /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto renew --quiet --agree-tos --no-self-upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\nThe certificate will only be renewed if it is close to expiring.\n\n\nPre- and post-renewal hooks\n\n\ncertbot-auto\n

some cases in which you might need an alternative to running \ncertbot\n or \ncertbot-auto\n as above.\nFor example:\n\n\n\n\nYou have a web server running on port 80 that you do not want to shut down during renewal\n\n\nYou cannot open port 80 during renewal\n\n\nYou want a wildcard certificate\n\n\nYou want to run the renewal on a different machine than where the certificate will be used\n\n\n\n\nCertbot plugins\n may help in these\ncases.\n\n\n\n\nThe Apache, Nginx, and Webroot plugins integrate with an already running web server to allow renewal\nwithout shutting the webserver down.\n\n\nOne of the DNS plugins can be used to avoid using port 80, run on a different machine, or obtain a wildcard cert.\n\n\nIf all else fails, the manual plugin can be used for manual renewal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe DNS plugins do not work with \ncertbot-auto\n.\n   You will need to use one of the \nDocker containers\n if you are using\n   Enterprise Linux 6.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful OpenSSL commands (from NCSA)\n -\n    e.g. how to convert the format of your certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Let's Encrypt setup guide\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother

These only work with the RPMs that provide CAs (that is, \nosg-ca-certs\n and the like, but not \nosg-ca-scripts\n.)

CRLs contain certificate blacklists that OSG software uses to ensure that your hosts are only talking to valid clients or servers. To maintain up to date CAs, you will need to run the \nfetch-crl\n services. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNormally \nfetch-crl\n is installed when you install the rest of the software and you do not need to explicitly install it.\nIf you do wish to install it manually, run the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install fetch-crl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not wish to change the frequency of \nfetch-crl\n updates (default: every 6 hours) or use syslog for \nfetch-crl\n output, \n\nskip to the service management section\n\n\nOptional: configuring \nfetch-crl\n\n\nThe following sub-sections contain optional configuration instructions.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNote that the \nnosymlinks\n option in the configuration files refers to ignoring links within the certificates directory (e.g. two different names for the same file).

The fetch-crl-boot service runs \nfetch-crl\n and is intended to only be enabled or disabled. The \nfetch-crl-cron\n service runs \nfetch-crl\n every 6 hours (with a random sleep time included). Both services are disabled by default. At the very minimum, the \nfetch-crl-cron\n service needs to be enabled and started, otherwise services will begin to fail as existing CRLs expire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch CRL\n\n\nfetch-crl-cron\n\n\nRuns \nfetch-crl\n every 6 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n\n\nRuns \nfetch-crl\n immediately\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the services in the order listed and stop them in reverse order.

dependencies.\n\n\n\n\nDanger\n\n\nOther repositories, such as \njpackage\n, \ndag\n, or \nrpmforge\n, are not supported and you may encounter problems if\nyou use them.\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Software\n\n\nCertain sites have requested new versions of software that would be considered \"disruptive\" or \"experimental\":\nupgrading to them would likely require manual intervention after their installation.\nWe do not want sites to unwittingly upgrade to these versions.\nFor the benefit of the sites that are interested in upgrading to these versions, we want to provide the same assurance\nof quality and production-readiness that we guarantee for the \nosg\n release repository.\n\n\nDue to the relatively small number of such packages, a full fork of the OSG 3 distribution is not warranted.\nInstead, we have created a separate set of repositories that contain only the \"disruptive\" versions of the software.\n\n\nThese repositories have the same structure as our standard repositories.\nFor example, there are \nosg-upcoming-testing\n and \nosg-upcoming\n repositories, which are analagous to the \nosg-testing\n\nand \nosg\n repositories, respectively.\n\n\nA full installation of our software stack is \nnot\n possible using only the \nosg-upcoming\n repositories, since they\ncontain a small subset of the software we ship.\nBoth the main \nosg\n and the \nosg-upcoming\n repositories will need to be enabled for the installation to work.\nBecause of this, interoperability will be maintained between the main \nosg\n and \nosg-upcoming\n.\n\n\nDepending on test results from sites, some packages in \nosg-upcoming\n may eventually end up in the main \nosg\n branch.\nThe rest of the packages will eventually form the basis of the next \nOSG release series\n\n(e.g. \"OSG 3.5\").\n\n\nContrib Software\n\n\nIn addition to our regular software repositories, we also have a \ncontrib\n (short for \"contributed\") software repository.\nThis is software that is does not go through the same software testing and release processes as the official OSG\nSoftware release, but may be useful to you.\nParticularly, contrib software is not guaranteed to be

Normally, all modules are run when calling \nosg-configure\n.\nHowever, it is possible to run specific modules separately.\nTo see a list of modules, including whether they can be run separately, run:\n\n\n[root@server] osg-configure -l\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the module can be run separately, specify it with the \n-m \nMODULE\n option, where \nMODULE\n is one of the items\nof the output of the previous command.\n\n\n[root@server] osg-configure -c -m \nMODULE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions may be specified in multiple INI files, which may make it hard to determine which value OSG-Configure uses.\nYou may query the final value of an option via one of these methods:\n\n\n[root@server] osg-configure -q -o \nOPTION\n\n\n[root@server] osg-configure -q -o \nSECTION\n.\nOPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nOPTION\n is the variable from which we want to know the value and \nSECTION\n refers to a section in any of the INI\nfiles, i.e. any name between brackets e.g. \n[Squid]\n.\n\n\nLogs are written to \n/var/log/osg/osg-configure.log\n.\nIf something goes wrong, specify the \n-d\n flag to add more verbose output to \nosg-configure.log\n.\n\n\nThe rest of this document will detail what to specify in the INI files.\n\n\nConventions\n\n\nIn the tables below:\n\n\n\n\nMandatory options for a section are given in \nbold\n type. Sometime the default value may be OK and no edit required, but the variable has to be in the file.\n\n\nOptions that are not found in the default ini file are in \nitalics\n.\n\n\n\n\nSyntax and layout\n\n\nThe configuration files used by \nosg-configure\n are the one supported by Python's \nSafeConfigParser\n, similar in format to the \nINI configuration file\n used by MS Windows:\n\n\n\n\nConfig files are separated into sections, specified by a section name in square brackets (e.g. \n[Section 1]\n)\n\n\nOptions should be set using \nname = value\n pairs\n\n\nLines that begin with \n;\n or \n#\n are comments\n\n\nLong lines can be split up using continutations: each white space character can be preceded by a newline to fold/continue the field on a new line (same syntax as specified in \nemail RFC 822\n)\n\n\nVariable substitutions are supported -- \nsee below\n\n\n\n\nosg-configure\n reads and uses all of the files in \n/etc/osg/config.d\n that have a \".ini\" suffix. The files in this directory are ordered with a numeric prefix with higher numbers being applied later and thus having higher precedence (e.g. 00-foo.ini has a lower precedence than 99-local-site-settings.ini). Configuration sections and options can be specified multiple times in different files. E.g. a section called \n[PBS]\n can be given in \n20-pbs.ini\n as well as \n99-local-site-settings.ini\n.\n\n\nEach of the files are successively read and merged to create a final configuration that is then used to configure OSG software. Options and settings in files read later override the ones in previous files. This allows admins to create a file with local settings (e.g. \n99-local-site-settings.ini\n) that can be read last and which will be take precedence over the default settings in configuration files installed by various RPMs and which will not be overwritten if RPMs are updated.\n\n\nVariable substitution\n\n\nThe osg-configure parser allows variables to be defined and used in the configuration file:\nany option set in a given section can be used as a variable in that section.  Assuming that you have set an option with the name \nmyoption\n in the section, you can substitute the value of that option elsewhere in the section by referring to it as \n%(myoption)s\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe trailing \ns\n is required. Also, option names cannot have a variable subsitution in them.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Settings\n\n\nIf a setting is set to UNAVAILABLE or DEFAULT or left blank, osg-configure will try to use a sensible default for setting if possible.\n\n\nIgnore setting\n\n\nThe \nenabled\n option, specifying whether a service is enabled or not, is a boolean but also accepts \nIgnore\n as a possible value. Using Ignore, results in the service associated with the section being ignored entirely (and any configuration is skipped). This differs from using \nFalse\n (or the \n%(disabled)s\n variable), because using \nFalse\n results in the service associated with the section being disabled. \nosg-configure\n will not change the configuration of the service if the \nenabled\n is set to \nIgnore\n.\n\n\nThis is useful, if you have a complex configuration for a given that can't be set up using the ini configuration files. You can manually configure that service by hand editing config files, manually start/stop the service and then use the \nIgnore\n setting so that \nosg-configure\n does not alter the service's configuration and status.\n\n\nConfiguration sections\n\n\nThe OSG configuration is divided into sections with each section starting with a section name in square brackets (e.g. \n[Section 1]\n). The configuration is split in multiple files and options form one section can be in more than one files.\n\n\nThe following sections give an overview of the options for each of the sections of the configuration files that \nosg-configure\n uses.\n\n\nBosco\n\n\nThis section is contained in \n/etc/osg/config.d/20-bosco.ini\n which is provided by the \nosg-configure-bosco\n RPM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nValues Accepted\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenabled\n\n\nTrue\n, \nFalse\n, \nIgnore\n\n\nThis indicates whether the Bosco jobmanager is being used or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusers\n\n\nString\n\n\nA comma separated string.

Rather, the options set in this section will be placed in the \nosg-local-job-environment.conf\n verbatim. The options in this section are case sensitive and the case will be preserved when they are converted to environment variables. The \nosg-local-job-environment.conf\n file gets sourced by jobs run on your cluster so any variables set in this section will appear in the environment of jobs run on your system.\n\n\nAdding a line such as \nMy_Setting = my_Value\n would result in the an environment variable called \nMy_Setting\n set to \nmy_Value\n in the job's environment. \nmy_Value\n can also be defined in terms of an environment variable (i.e \nMy_Setting = $my_Value\n) that will be evaluated on the worker node. For example, to add a variable \nMY_PATH\n set to \n/usr/local/myapp\n, you'd have the following:\n\n\n[Local Settings]\n\n\n\nMY_PATH\n \n=\n \n/usr/local/myapp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section is contained in \n/etc/osg/config.d/40-localsettings.ini\n which is provided by the \nosg-configure-ce\n RPM.\n\n\nMisc Services\n\n\nThis section handles the configuration of services that do not have a dedicated section for their configuration.\n\n\nThis section is contained in \n/etc/osg/config.d/10-misc.ini\n which is provided by the \nosg-configure-misc\n RPM.\n\n\nThis section primarily deals with authentication/authorization.

It \ndoes not\n cover anything but the simplest possible install.\nPlease consult the \nGlideinWMS reference\ndocumentation\n\nfor advanced topics, including non-\nroot\n, non-RPM-based installation.\n\n\nThis document covers three components of the GlideinWMS a VO needs to install:\n\n\n\n\nUser Pool Collectors\n: A set of \ncondor_collector\n processes. Pilots submitted by the factory will join to one of these collectors to form a HTCondor pool.\n\n\nUser Pool Schedd\n: A \ncondor_schedd\n. Users may submit HTCondor vanilla universe jobs to this schedd; it will run jobs in the HTCondor pool formed by the \nUser Pool Collectors\n.\n\n\nGlidein Frontend\n: The frontend will periodically query the \nUser Pool Schedd\n to determine the desired number of running job slots. If necessary, it will request the Factory to launch additional pilots.\n\n\n\n\nThis guide covers installation of all three components on the same host: it is\ndesigned for small to medium VOs (see the Hardware Requirements below). Given a\nsignificant, large host, we have been able to scale the single-host install to\n20,000 running jobs.\n\n\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux users \napache\n (UID 48), \ncondor\n, \nfrontend\n, and \ngratia\n\n\nNetwork:\n The VO frontend must have reliable network connectivity and be on the public internet (i.e. no NAT).\n    The latest version requires the following TCP ports to be open:\n\n\n80 (HTTP) for monitoring and serving configuration to workers\n\n\n9618 (HTCondor shared port) for HTCondor daemons including the Schedd and User Collector\n\n\n9620 to 9660 for secondary collectors (depending on configuration, see below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost choice\n: The GlideinWMS VO Frontend has the following hardware requirements for a production host:\n\n\nCPU\n: Four cores, preferably no more than 2 years old.\n\n\nRAM\n: 3GB plus 2MB per running job. For example, to sustain 2000 running jobs, a host with 5GB is needed.\n\n\nDisk\n: 30GB will be sufficient for all the binaries, config and log files related to GlideinWMS. As this will be an interactive submit host, have enough disk space for your users' jobs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe default configuration uses a port range (9620 to 9660) for the secondary collectors.\nYou can configure the secondary collectors to use the shared port 9618 instead;\nthis will become the default in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nGlideinWMS versions prior to 3.4.1 also required port 9615 for the Schedd,\nand did not support using shared port for the secondary collectors.\nIf you are upgrading a standalone submit host from version 3.4 or earlier, the default open \nport has changed from 9615 to 9618, and you need to update your firewall rules to reflect this change.\nYou can figure out which port will be used by running the following command:\n\n\nconsole\n condor_config_val SHARED_PORT_ARGS\n\n\n\n\nFor more detailed information, see \nConfiguring GlideinWMS Frontend\n.\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has a \nsupported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nCredentials and Proxies\n\n\nThe VO Frontend will use two credentials in its interactions with the other GlideinWMS services. At this time, these will be proxy files.\n\n\n\n\nthe \nVO Frontend proxy\n (used to authenticate with the other GlideinWMS services).\n\n\none or more GlideinWMS \npilot proxies\n (used/delegated to the Factory services and submitted on the GlideinWMS pilot jobs).\n\n\n\n\nThe \nVO Frontend proxy\n and the \npilot proxy\n can\nbe the same. By default, the VO Frontend will run as user \nfrontend\n (UID is\nmachine dependent) so these proxies must be owned by the user \nfrontend\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBoth proxies need to be passwordless to allow \nautomatic proxy renewal\n.\n\n\n\n\nVO Frontend proxy\n\n\nThe use of a service certificate is recommended. Then you create a proxy from the certificate as explained in the \n\nproxy configuration section\n.\n\n\nYou must give the Factory operations team the DN of this proxy when you\ninitially setup the Frontend and each time the DN changes\n.\n\n\nPilot proxies\n\n\nThese proxies are used by the Factory to submit the GlideinWMS pilot jobs.\nTherefore, they must be authorized to access to the CEs (Factory entry points)\nwhere jobs are submitted. There is no need to notify the Factory operation about\nthe DN of these proxies (neither at the initial registration nor for subsequent\nchanges). These additional proxies have no special requirements or controls added by the\nFactory but will probably require VO attributes because of the CEs: if you are\nable to use one of these proxies to submit jobs to the corresponding CEs where the Factory runs\nGlideinWMS pilots for you, then the proxies are OK. You can test each of your proxies using\n\nglobusrun\n or HTCondor-G.\n\n\nTo check the important information about a PEM certificate you can use: \nopenssl\nx509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -subject -issuer -dates -noout\n. You\nwill need that to find out information for the configuration files and the\nrequest to the GlideinWMS Factory.\n\n\nOSG Factory access\n\n\nBefore installing the GlideinWMS VO Frontend you need the information about a \nGlidein Factory\n that you can access:\n\n\n\n\n(recommended) OSG is managing a factory at UCSD\n\n\nYou have another Glidein Factory that you can access\n\n\n\n\nTo request access to the OSG Glidein Factory at UCSD you have to send an email to \n providing:\n\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\nThe VO that is utilizing the VO Frontend\n\n\nThe DN of the proxy you will use to communicate with the Factory (VO Frontend DN, e.g. the host certificate subject if you follow the \nproxy configuration section\n)\n\n\nYou can propose a security name that will have to be confirmed/changed by the Factory managers (see below)\n\n\n\n\nA list of sites where you want to run:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour VO must be supported on those sites\n\n\n\n\nYou can provide a list or piggy back on existing lists, e.g. all the sites supported for the VO. Check with the Factory managers\n\n\nYou can start with one single site\n\n\n\n\nIn the reply from the OSG Factory managers you will receive some information needed for the configuration of your VO Frontend\n\n\n\n\nThe exact spelling and capitalization of your VO name. Sometime is different from what is commonly used, e.g. OSG VO is \"OSGVO\".\n\n\nThe host of the Factory Collector: \ngfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n\nThe DN os the factory, e.g. \n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n\nThe factory identity, e.g.: \ngfactory@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n\nThe identity on the Factory you will be mapped to. Something like: \nusername@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n\nYour security name. A unique name, usually containing your VO name: \nMy_SecName\n\n\nA string to add in the main Factory query_expr in the Frontend configuration, e.g. \nstringListMember(\"\nVO\n\",GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)\n.\n   This is used to select the entries you can use.\n   From there you get the correct name of the VO (above in this list).\n\n\n\n\nInstalling GlideinWMS Frontend\n\n\nInstalling HTCondor\n\n\nIf you don't have HTCondor already installed, you can install the HTCondor RPM\nfrom the OSG repository:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install condor.x86_64\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you already have installed HTCondor using a tarball or a source other than\nthe OSG ROM, you will need to install the empty-condor RPM:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install empty-condor --enablerepo\n=\nosg-empty\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the VO Frontend RPM\n\n\nInstall the RPM and dependencies (be prepared for a lot of dependencies).\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install glideinwms-vofrontend\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will install the current production release verified and tested by OSG with\ndefault HTCondor configuration. This command will install the GlideinWMS\nvofrontend, HTCondor, the OSG client, and all the required dependencies all on one\nnode.\n\n\nIf you wish to install a different version of GlideinWMS, add the \"--enablerepo\"\nargument to the command as follows:\n\n\n\n\nyum install --enablerepo=osg-testing glideinwms-vofrontend\n: The most recent production release, still in testing phase. This will usually match the current tarball version on the GlideinWMS home page. (The osg-release production version may lag behind the tarball release by a few weeks as it is verified and packaged by OSG). Note that this will also take the osg-testing versions of all dependencies as well.\n\n\nyum install --enablerepo=osg-upcoming glideinwms-vofrontend\n: The most recent development series release, i.e. version 3.3 release. This has newer features such as cloud submission support, but is less tested.\n\n\n\n\nNote that these commands will install default HTCondor configurations with all\nGlideinWMS services on one node.\n\n\nInstalling GlideinWMS Frontend on Multiple Nodes (Advanced)\n\n\nFor advanced users expecting heavy usage on their submit node, you may want to\nconsider splitting the user collector, user submit, and vo frontend\nservices. This can be doing using the following three commands (on different\nmachines):\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install glideinwms-vofrontend-standalone\n\nroot@host #\n yum install glideinwms-usercollector\n\nroot@host #\n yum install glideinwms-userschedd\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, you will need to perform the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nOn the vofrontend and userschedd, modify \nCONDOR_HOST\n to point to your usercollector. This is in \n/etc/condor/config.d/00_gwms_general.config\n. You can also override this value by placing it in a new config file. (For instance, \n/etc/condor/config.d/99_local_custom.config\n to avoid rpmsave/rpmnew conflicts on upgrades).\n\n\nIn \n/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile\n, you will need to add the DNs of each machine (userschedd, usercollector, vofrontend). Take great care to escape all special characters. Alternatively, you can use the \nglidecondor_addDN\n to add these values.\n\n\nIn the \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n file, change the schedd locations to match the correct server. Also change the collectors tags at the bottom of the file. More details on frontend.xml are in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring GlideinWMS Frontend\n\n\nAfter installing the RPM, you need to configure the components of the GlideinWMS VO Frontend:\n\n\n\n\nEdit Frontend configuration options\n\n\nEdit HTCondor configuration options\n\n\nCreate a HTCondor grid map file\n\n\nReconfigure and Start the Frontend\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Frontend\n\n\nThe VO Frontend configuration file is \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n. The next steps will describe each line that you will need to edit if you are using the OSG Factory at UCSD. The portions to edit are highlighted. If you are using a different Factory more changes are necessary, please check the VO Frontend configuration reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe VO you are affiliated with. This will identify those CEs that the GlideinWMS pilot will be authorized to run on using the \npilot proxy\n described previously in \nthis section\n. Sometimes the whole \nquery_expr\n is provided to you by the Factory operators (see Factory access above):\n\n\nfactory\n \nquery_expr=\n((stringListMember(\nVO\n, GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactory collector information. The \nusername\n that you are assigned by the Factory (also called the identity you will be mapped to on the factory, see above) . Note that if you are using a factory different than the production Factory, you will have to change also \nDN\n, \nfactory_identity\n and \nnode\n attributes. (refer to the information provided to you by the Factory operator):\n\n\ncollector\n \nDN=\n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n           \ncomment=\nDefine factory collector globally for simplicity\n\n           \nfactory_identity=\ngfactory@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n           \nmy_identity=\nusername@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n\n           \nnode=\ngfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend security information.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nclassad_proxy\n in the security entry is the location of the VO Frontend proxy described previously \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe \nproxy_DN\n is the DN of the \nclassad_proxy\n above.\n\n\nThe \nsecurity_name\n identifies this VO Frontend to the the Factory, It is provided by the Factory operator.\n\n\nThe \nabsfname\n in the credential entry is the location of the GlideinWMS \npilot proxy\n described in the requirements section \nhere\n. There can be multiple pilot proxies, or even other kind of keys (e.g. if you use cloud resources). \nThe type and trust_domain of the credential must match respectively auth_method and trust_domain used in the entry definition in the Factory. If there is no match, between these two attributes in one of the credentials and the corresponding ones in some entry in one of the Factories, then this Frontend cannot trigger glideins.\n\nBoth the \nclassad_proxy\n and \nabsfname\n files should be owned by \nfrontend\n user.\nsecurity\n \nclassad_proxy=\n/tmp/vo_proxy\n \nproxy_DN=\nDN of vo_proxy\n\n      \nproxy_selection_plugin=\nProxyAll\n\n      \nsecurity_name=\nThe security name, this is used by factory\n\n      \nsym_key=\naes_256_cbc\n\n      \ncredentials\n\n        \ncredential\n \nabsfname=\n/tmp/pilot_proxy\n \nsecurity_class=\nfrontend\n\n        \ntrust_domain=\nOSG\n \ntype=\ngrid_proxy\n/\n\n      \n/credentials\n\n\n/security\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe schedd information.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nDN\n of the \nVO Frontend Proxy\n described previously \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe \nfullname\n attribute is the fully qualified domain name of the host where you installed the VO Frontend (\nhostname --fqdn\n).\nA secondary schedd is optional. You will need to delete the secondary schedd line if you are not using it. Multiple schedds allow the Frontend to service requests from multiple submit hosts.\nschedds\n\n  \nschedd\n \nDN=\nCert DN used by the schedd at fullname:\n\n        \nfullname=\nHostname of the schedd\n/\n\n   \nschedd\n \nDN=\nCert DN used by the second Schedd at fullname:\n\n         \nfullname=\nschedd name@Hostname of second schedd\n/\n\n\n/schedds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe User Collector information.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nDN\n of the \nVO Frontend Proxy\n described previously \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe \nnode\n attribute is the full hostname of the collectors (\nhostname --fqdn\n) and port\n\n\nThe \nsecondary\n attribute indicates whether the element is for the primary or secondary collectors (True/False).\n The default HTCondor configuration of the VO Frontend starts multiple Collector processes on the host (\n/etc/condor/config.d/11_gwms_secondary_collectors.config\n). The \nDN\n and \nhostname\n on the first line are the hostname and the host certificate of the VO Frontend. The \nDN\n and \nhostname\n on the second line are the same as the ones in the first one. The hostname (e.g. hostname.domain.tld) is filled automatically during the installation. The secondary collector connection can be defined as sinful string for the sock case , e.g., hostname.domain.tld:9618?sock=collector16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Example 1]\n\n\n        :::xml\n        \ncollector DN=\nDN of main collector\n\n               node=\nhostname.domain.tld:9618\n secondary=\nFalse\n/\n\n        \ncollector DN=\nDN of secondary collectors (usually same as DN in line above)\n\n               node=\nhostname.domain.tld:9620-9660\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS v3.4.1, shared port only configuration is incompatible if talking to older Factories (v3.4 or older). We strongly recommend any user of GlideinWMS Frontend v3.4.1 or newer, to transition to the use of shared port for secondary collectors and CCBs.\nThe shared port configuration is incompatible if your Frontend is talking to Factories v3.4 or older and you'll get an error telling you to wait.\nTo transition to the use of shared port for secondary collectors, you have to change the collectors section in the Frontend configuration. If you are using the default port range for the secondary collectors as shown in [Example 2] below, then you should replace it with port \n9618\n and the sock-range as shown in [Example 1] above.\n\n\nIf you have a more complex configuration, please read the \ndetailed GlideinWMS configuration\n\n\n[Example 2]\n\n\n        :::xml\n        \ncollector DN=\nDN of main collector\n\n               node=\nhostname.domain.tld:9618\n secondary=\nFalse\n/\n\n        \ncollector DN=\nDN of secondary collectors (usually same as DN in line above)\n\n               node=\u201chostname.domain.tld:9618?sock=collector0-40\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CCBs information.\n    If you have a different configuration of the HTCondor Connection Brokering (CCB servers) from the default (usually the section is empty as the User Collectors acts as CCB if needed), you can set the connection in the CCB section the same way that User Collector information previously mentioned. Also, the same rules for transition to shared_port of the connections, apply to the CCBs.\n    :::xml\n    \nccb DN=\nDN of the CCB server\n\n           node=\nhostname.domain.tld:9618\n/\n\n    \nccb DN=\nDN of the CCB server\n\n           node=\u201chostname.domain.tld:9618?sock=collector0-40\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe Frontend configuration includes many knobs, some of which are conflicting with a RPM installation where there is only one version of the Frontend installed and it uses well known paths.     Do not change the following in the Frontend configuration (you must leave the default values coming with the RPM installation):\n\n\n\n\nfrontend_versioning='False' (in the first line of XML, versioning is useful to install multiple tarball versions)\n\n\nfor RPM installs, work base_dir must be /var/lib/gwms-frontend/vofrontend/ (other scripts like /etc/init.d/gwms-frontend count on that value)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a Different Factory\n\n\nThe configuration above points to the OSG production Factory. If you are using a different Factory, then you have to:\n\n\n\n\nreplace \ngfactory@gfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n and \ngfactory-1.t2.ucsd.edu\n with the correct values for your Factory. And control also that the name used for the Frontend () matches.\n\n\nmake sure that the Factory is advertising the attributes used in the Factory query expression (\nquery_expr\n).\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring HTCondor\n\n\nThe HTCondor configuration for the Frontend is placed in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n.\n\n\n\n\n00_gwms_general.config\n\n\n01_gwms_collectors.config\n\n\n02_gwms_schedds.config\n\n\n03_gwms_local.config\n\n\n11_gwms_secondary_collectors.config\n\n\n90_gwms_dns.config\n\n\n\n\nFor most installations create a new file named \n/etc/condor/config.d/92_local_condor.config\n\n\nUsing other HTCondor RPMs, e.g. UW Madison HTCondor RPM\n\n\nThe above procedure will work if you are using the OSG HTCondor RPMS. You can\nverify that you used the OSG HTCondor RPM by using \nyum list condor\n. The\nversion name should include \"osg\", e.g. \n8.6.4-3.osg.el7\n.\n\n\nIf you are using the UW Madison HTCondor RPMS, be aware of the following changes:\n\n\n\n\nThis HTCondor RPM uses a file \n/etc/condor/condor_config.local\n to add your local machine slot to the user pool.\n\n\nIf you want to disable this behavior (recommended), you should blank out that file or comment out the line in \n/etc/condor/condor_config\n for LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE. (Make sure that LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR is set to \n/etc/condor/config.d\n)\n\n\nNote that the variable LOCAL_DIR is set differently in UW Madison and OSG RPMs. This should not cause any more problems in the GlideinWMS RPMs, but please take note if you use this variable in your job submissions or other customizations.\n\n\n\n\nIn general if you are using a non OSG RPM or if you added custom configuration\nfiles for HTCondor please check the order of the configuration files:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_config_val -config\n\nConfiguration source:\n\n\n    /etc/condor/condor_config\n\n\nLocal configuration sources:\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/00_gwms_general.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/01_gwms_collectors.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/02_gwms_schedds.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/03_gwms_local.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/11_gwms_secondary_collectors.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/90_gwms_dns.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/condor_config.local\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf, like in the example above, the GlideinWMS configuration files are not the\nlast ones in the list please verify that important configuration options have\nnot been overridden by the other configuration files.\n\n\nVerifying your HTCondor configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GlideinWMS configuration files in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n should be the last ones in the list. If not, please verify that important configuration options have not been overridden by the other configuration files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the alll the expected HTCondor daemons are running:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_config_val -verbose DAEMON_LIST DAEMON_LIST: MASTER, COLLECTOR, NEGOTIATOR, SCHEDD, SHARED_PORT, COLLECTOR0\n\nCOLLECTOR1 COLLECTOR2 COLLECTOR3 COLLECTOR4 COLLECTOR5 COLLECTOR6 COLLECTOR7 COLLECTOR8 COLLECTOR9 COLLECTOR10 , COLLECTOR11, COLLECTOR12,\n\n\nCOLLECTOR13, COLLECTOR14, COLLECTOR15, COLLECTOR16, COLLECTOR17, COLLECTOR18, COLLECTOR19, COLLECTOR20, COLLECTOR21, COLLECTOR22, COLLECTOR23,\n\n\nCOLLECTOR24, COLLECTOR25, COLLECTOR26, COLLECTOR27, COLLECTOR28, COLLECTOR29, COLLECTOR30, COLLECTOR31, COLLECTOR32, COLLECTOR33, COLLECTOR34,\n\n\nCOLLECTOR35, COLLECTOR36, COLLECTOR37, COLLECTOR38, COLLECTOR39, COLLECTOR40\n\n\nDefined in \n/etc/condor/config.d/11_gwms_secondary_collectors.config\n, line 193.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't see all the collectors. shared port and the two schedd, then the\nconfiguration must be corrected. There should be \nno\n \nstartd\n daemons\nlisted.\n\n\nCreating a HTCondor grid mapfile.\n\n\nThe HTCondor mapfile (\n/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile\n) is used for\nauthentication between the GlideinWMS pilot running on a remote worker node, and\nthe local collector. HTCondor uses the mapfile to map certificates to pseudo-users\non the local machine. It is important that you map the DN's of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach schedd proxy\n: The \nDN\n of each schedd that the frontend talks to.

Choose one of the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo directly sign the VOMS attributes (recommended), you must have access to the \nvo\n's certificate and key.\n  Specify the paths to the \nvo\n certificate and key, and optionally, the VOMS attribute (e.g. \n/osg/Role=NULL/Capability=NULL\n\n  for the OSG VO):\n\n\nuse_voms_server = false\nvo_cert = \nPATH TO THE PILOT CERTIFICATE\n\nvo_key = \nPATH TO THE PILOT KEY\n\nfqan = \nVOMS ATTRIBUTE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you do not have access to the \nvo\n's \nvoms_cert\n and \nvoms_key\n, contact the VO manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo have your proxy's VOMS attributes signed by the \nvo\n's VOMS server, set \nuse_voms_server = true\n\n  and the VOMS attribute (e.g. \n/osg/Role=NULL/Capability=NULL\n for the OSG VO):\n\n\nuse_voms_server = true\nfqan = \nVOMS ATTRIBUTE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nDue to the \nretirement of VOMS Admin server\n\nin the OSG, \nuse_voms_server = false\n is the preferred method for signing VOMS attributes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptionally, the proxy renewal \nfrequency\n and \nlifetime\n (in hours) can be specified in each \n[PILOT \nNAME\n]\n section:\n\n\n# Default: 1\nfrequency = \nRENEWAL FREQUENCY\n\n# Default: 24\nlifetime = \nPROXY LIFETIME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the location and output of the \nVO Frontend proxy\n under the \n[FRONTEND]\n section and set\n   the \nproxy_cert\n, \nproxy_key\n, and \noutput\n to paths corresponding to your VO Frontend:\n\n\n[FRONTEND]\nproxy_cert = \nPATH TO THE FRONTEND CERTIFICATE\n\nproxy_key = \nPATH TO THE FRONTEND KEY\n\noutput = \nPATH TO CREATE THE FRONTEND PROXY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\noutput\n must be the same path as the \nclassad_proxy\n specified in \nthis section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(OPTIONAL)\n If you are running the \ngwms-frontend\n service under a \nNON-DEFAULT USER\n (default: \nfrontend\n),\n   specify the user as the owner of your proxies under the \n[COMMON]\n section:\n\n\n[COMMON]\nowner = \nNON-DEFAULT USER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \n[COMMON]\n section is required but its contents are optional\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Gratia Accounting and a Local Monitoring Page on a Production Server\n\n\nYou must report accounting information if you are running more than a few test jobs on the OSG .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the GlideinWMS Gratia Probe on each of your submit hosts in your GlideinWMS installation:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install gratia-probe-glideinwms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the ProbeConfig located in \n/etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n. First, edit the \nSiteName\n and \nProbeName\n to be a unique identifier for your GlideinWMS Submit host. There can be multiple probes (with different names) per site. If you haven't already, you should register your GlideinWMS submit host in \nOIM\n. Then you can use the name you used to register the resource.\n\n\nProbeName=\ncondor:\nhostname\n\nSiteName=\nHCC-GlideinWMW-Frontend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, turn the probe on by setting \nEnableProbe\n:\n\n\nEnableProbe=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReconfigure HTCondor:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Accounting Configuration\n\n\nThe following sections contain additional configuration that may be required depending on the customizations you've made to your GlideinWMS frontend installation.\n\n\nUsers without Certificates\n\n\nIf you have users that submit jobs without a certificate explicitly declared in the submit file, you will need to add \nMapUnknownToGroup\n to the ProbeConfig. In the file \n/etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n, add the value after the \nEnableProbe\n.\n\n\n    ...\n    SuppressGridLocalRecords=\n0\n\n    EnableProbe=\n1\n\n\n    MapUnknownToGroup=\n1\n\n\n\n    Title3=\nTuning parameter\n\n    ...\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, if you want to record all usage as coming from a single VO, you can configure the probe to override the 'guessed' VO. In the below example, replace \nENGAGE\n with a registered VO that you would like to report as. If you don't have a VO that you are affiliated with, you may use \"Engage\".\n\n\n...\n    MapUnknownToGroup=\n1\n\n    MapGroupToRole=\n1\n\n\n    VOOverride=\nENGAGE\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Standard HTCondor Install\n\n\nIf HTCondor is installed in a non-standard location (i.e., not RPMs, or relocated RPM outside \n/usr/bin\n), then you need to tell the probe where to find the HTCondor binaries. This can be done with a script with a special attribute in \n/etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n, \nCondorLocation\n. Point it to the location of the HTCondor install, such that \nCondorLocation/bin/condor_version\n exists.\n\n\nNew Data Directory\n\n\nIf your \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n HTCondor configuration variable is different from the default value, you must update the value of \nDataFolder\n in \n/etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n. To check the value of \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n run the following command:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_config_val PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent collector and other customizations\n\n\nBy default the probe reports to the OSG GRACC. To change that you must edit the configuration file, \n/etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n, and replace the OSG production host with your desired one:\n\n\n...\n    CollectorHost=\ngratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80\n\n    SSLHost=\ngratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:443\n\n    SSLRegistrationHost=\ngratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Configuration\n\n\nThe following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be required\nfor setting up a small site.

The glideinFrontend crashes after a XML parsing exception visible in the log file (\"Exception occurred: ... 'ExpatError: no element found: line 1, column 0\\n']\").\n\n\nRemove the status file. Then start the frontend.

This software is\nthe minimum requirement for a VO to use GlideinWMS.  This document assumes expertise with HTCondor and familiarity with the GlideinWMS\nsoftware. It  does not  cover anything but the simplest possible install.\nPlease consult the  GlideinWMS reference\ndocumentation \nfor advanced topics, including non- root , non-RPM-based installation.  This document covers three components of the GlideinWMS a VO needs to install:   User Pool Collectors : A set of  condor_collector  processes. Pilots submitted by the factory will join to one of these collectors to form a HTCondor pool.  User Pool Schedd : A  condor_schedd . Users may submit HTCondor vanilla universe jobs to this schedd; it will run jobs in the HTCondor pool formed by the  User Pool Collectors .  Glidein Frontend : The frontend will periodically query the  User Pool Schedd  to determine the desired number of running job slots. If necessary, it will request the Factory to launch additional pilots.   This guide covers installation of all three components on the same host: it is\ndesigned for small to medium VOs (see the Hardware Requirements below).

RAM : 3GB plus 2MB per running job. For example, to sustain 2000 running jobs, a host with 5GB is needed.  Disk : 30GB will be sufficient for all the binaries, config and log files related to GlideinWMS. As this will be an interactive submit host, have enough disk space for your users' jobs.       Note  The default configuration uses a port range (9620 to 9660) for the secondary collectors.\nYou can configure the secondary collectors to use the shared port 9618 instead;\nthis will become the default in the future.    Note  GlideinWMS versions prior to 3.4.1 also required port 9615 for the Schedd,\nand did not support using shared port for the secondary collectors.\nIf you are upgrading a standalone submit host from version 3.4 or earlier, the default open \nport has changed from 9615 to 9618, and you need to update your firewall rules to reflect this change.\nYou can figure out which port will be used by running the following command:  console\n condor_config_val SHARED_PORT_ARGS   For more detailed information, see  Configuring GlideinWMS Frontend .

            "text": "Install a CVMFS Stratum 1\n\n\nThis document describes how to install a CVMFS Stratum 1. There are many different variations on how to do that, but this document focuses on the configuration of the OSG Operations Stratum 1 oasis-replica.opensciencegrid.org. It is applicable to other Stratum 1s as well, very likely with modifications (some of which are suggested in the document below).\n\n\n\n\nApplicable versions\n\n\nThe applicable software versions for this document are cvmfs and cvmfs-server \n= 2.4.2.\n\n\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points:\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs and Group IDs:\n If your machine is also going to be a repository server like OSG Operations, the installation will create the same user and group IDs as the \ncvmfs client\n.  If you are installing frontier-squid, the installation will also create the same user id as \nfrontier-squid\n.\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n This installation will host the stratum 1 on ports 80, 8000 and 8080, and if squid is installed it will host the uncached apache on port 8081.  Port 80 is default but sometimes runs into operational problems, port 8000 is the alternate for most production use, and port 8080 is for Cloudflare (https://openhtc.io).\n\n\nHost choice:\n -  Make sure there is adequate disk space for the repositories that will be served, at \n/srv/cvmfs\n. Do not use xfs as the filesystem type on operating systems older than EL7, because it has been demonstrated to perform poorly for CVMFS repositories; instead use ext3 or ext4. About 10GB should be reserved for apache and squid logs under /var/log on a production server, although they normally will not get that large. A Stratum 1 that is also a repository server should have at least 5GB available at \n/var/cache\n.\n\n\nSELinux\n - Ensure SELinux is disabled\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\n\n\nInstalling\n\n\nAll CVMFS Stratum 1s require cvmfs-server software and apache (httpd). It is highly recommended to also install \nfrontier-squid\n and \nfrontier-awstats\n on the same machine to be able to easily join the WLCG \nMRTG\n and \nawstats\n monitoring systems. The recommended configuration for frontier-squid below only caches geo api lookups.  Other than that, it is primarily for monitoring.\n\n\nInstalling cvmfs-server and httpd\n\n\nThe OSG Operations Stratum 1 has to function as a repository server in addition to serving repository replications; most Stratum 1s serve only replications. Instructions are also provided for how to install cvmfs-server on Stratum 1s that do not have to be repository servers.  Choose the appropriate subsection.\n\n\nInstalling a CVMFS stratum 1 that is also a repository server\n\n\nEL6 does not support a CVMFS repository server with the standard kernel, so use EL7.  EL7.2 cannot be reliably used as a repository server, because of bugs in the union filesystem OverlayFS. The bugs are fixed in EL7.3, so use EL7.3 or later.\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum -y install cvmfs-server cvmfs mod_wsgi\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling CVMFS stratum 1 that is not a repository server\n\n\nIf you're not installing for OSG Operations or otherwise want to support serving repositories on the same machine as a Stratum 1, use this command on either EL6 or EL7:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum -y install cvmfs-server cvmfs-config mod_wsgi\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling frontier-squid and frontier-awstats\n\n\nfrontier-awstats\n is not distributed by OSG so these instructions get it from its original source.  Do these commands to install frontier-squid and frontier-awstats:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -i http://frontier.cern.ch/dist/rpms/RPMS/noarch/frontier-release-1.1-1.noarch.rpm\n\nroot@host #\n yum -y install frontier-awstats\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring\n\n\nConfiguring the system\n\n\nIncrease the default number of open file descriptors:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \necho\n -e \n*\\t\\t-\\tnofile\\t\\t16384\n \n/etc/security/limits.conf \n\nroot@host #\n \nulimit\n -n \n16384\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order for this to apply also interactively when logging in over ssh, the option \nUsePAM\n has to be set to \nyes\n in \n/etc/ssh/sshd_config\n.\n\n\nConfiguring cron\n\n\nFirst, create the log directory: \n\n\nroot@host #\n mkdir -p /var/log/cvmfs\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the following in \n/etc/cron.d/cvmfs\n:\n\n\n*/5 * * * * root test -d /srv/cvmfs || exit;cvmfs_server snapshot -ai \n6 1 * * * root cvmfs_server gc -af 2\n/dev/null || true\n0 9 * * * root find /srv/cvmfs/*.*/data/txn -name \n*.*\n -mtime +2 2\n/dev/null|xargs rm -f\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, put the following in \n/etc/logrotate.d/cvmfs\n:\n\n\n/var/log/cvmfs/*.log {\n    weekly\n    missingok\n    notifempty\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring apache\n\n\nIf you are installing frontier-squid, create \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf\n and put the following lines into it:\n\n\nListen 8081 KeepAlive On\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not installing frontier-squid, instead put the following lines into that file:\n\n\nListen 8000 KeepAlive On\nListen 8080 KeepAlive On\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you will be serving opensciencegrid.org repositories, you have to allow for old client configurations that access repositories without the domain name added. For that reason, you will need to remove each \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.\nrepositoryname\n.conf\n that adding a replica creates (this is included in the \nadd_osg_repository script\n), and instead add the following to \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf\n:\n\n\nRewriteEngine On \nRewriteRule ^/cvmfs/([^./]*)/(.*)$ /cvmfs/$1.opensciencegrid.org/$2 \nRewriteRule ^/cvmfs/([^/]+)/api/(.*)$ /var/www/wsgi-scripts/cvmfs-server/cvmfs-api.wsgi/$1/$2\nRewriteRule ^/cvmfs/(.*)$ /srv/cvmfs/$1 \n\nDirectory \n/srv/cvmfs\n \n  Options -MultiViews +FollowSymLinks -Indexes \n  AllowOverride All \n  Require all granted\n\n  EnableMMAP Off EnableSendFile Off\n\n  \nFilesMatch \n^\\.cvmfs\n\n    ForceType application/x-cvmfs\n  \n/FilesMatch\n\n\n  Header unset Last-Modified \n  RequestHeader unset If-Modified-Since\n  FileETag None\n\n  ExpiresActive On \n  ExpiresDefault \naccess plus 3 days\n \n  ExpiresByType text/html \naccess plus 15 minutes\n \n  ExpiresByType application/x-cvmfs \naccess plus 61 seconds\n \n  ExpiresByType application/json \naccess plus 61 seconds\n \n\n/Directory\n\n\nWSGIDaemonProcess cvmfs-api threads=64 display-name=%{GROUP} \\\n    python-path=/usr/share/cvmfs-server/webapi\n\nDirectory /var/www/wsgi-scripts/cvmfs-server\n\n  WSGIProcessGroup cvmfs-api\n  WSGIApplicationGroup cvmfs-api\n  Options ExecCGI\n  SetHandler wsgi-script\n  Require all granted\n\n/Directory\n\nWSGISocketPrefix /var/run/wsgi \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOn EL6-based systems (Apache httpd 2.2) replace both instances of \nRequire all granted\n above with the following:\n\n\nOrder allow, deny\nAllow from all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you will be serving cern.ch repositories, it has the same problem; replace opensciencegrid.org above with cern.ch.

The repository chosen for the instructions below is one from egi.eu because it is very small, but you can use another one if you prefer.\n\n\nAdding an example repository\n\n\nThe OSG Operations Stratum 1 should add a repository replica using the \nadd_osg_repository\n script from the oasis-goc rpm. Instructions for installing that are elsewhere. That script assumes that the oasis.opensciencegrid.org replica repository was first created, so this instruction creates it but does not download the first snapshot because that would take a lot of space and time. Use these commands to create the oasis replica and to create and download the example replica:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server add-replica -o root http://oasis.opensciencegrid.org:8000/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org /etc/cvmfs/keys/opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid.org.pub \n\nroot@host #\n add_osg_repository http://cvmfs-stratum0.gridpp.rl.ac.uk:8000/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a good idea for other Stratum 1s to make their own scripts for adding repository replicas, because there's always two or three commands to run, and it's easy to forget the commands after the first one. The first command is this:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server add-replica -o root http://cvmfs-stratum0.gridpp.rl.ac.uk:8000/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu /etc/cvmfs/keys/egi.eu/egi.eu.pub\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, non-OSG Operations Stratum 1s (that is, at BNL and FNAL), for the sake of fulfilling an OSG security requirement, need to instead read from the OSG Operations machine with this as their first command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server add-replica -o root http://oasis-replica.opensciencegrid.org:8000/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu /etc/cvmfs/keys/egi.eu/egi.eu.pub:/etc/cvmfs/keys/opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid.org.pub\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second command for Stratum 1s that have the httpd configuration as described above in the \nConfiguring apache section\n is this:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rm -f /etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.config-egi.egi.eu.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the next command is this:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cvmfs_server snapshot config-egi.egi.eu\n\n\n\n\n\nWith large repositories that can take a very long time, but with small repositories it should be very quick and not show any errors.\n\n\nVerifying that the replica is being served\n\n\nNow to verify that the replication is working, do the following commands:\n\n\nroot@host #\n wget -qdO- http://localhost:8000/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu/.cvmfspublished \n|\n cat -v\n\nroot@host #\n wget -qdO- http://localhost:80/cvmfs/config-egi.egi.eu/.cvmfspublished \n|\n cat -v\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth commands should show a short file including gibberish at the end which is the signature.\n\n\nIt is a good idea to familiarize yourself with the log entries at \n/var/log/httpd/access_log\n and also, if you have installed frontier-squid, at \n/var/log/squid/access.log\n. Also, at least 15 minutes after the snapshot is finished, check the log \n/var/log/cvmfs/snapshots.log\n to see that it tried to get an update and got no errors.\n\n\nSetting up monitoring\n\n\nIf you installed frontier-squid and frontier-awstats, there is a little more to do to configure monitoring.\n\n\nFirst, make sure that your firewall accepts UDP queries from the monitoring server at CERN. Details are in \nthe frontier-squid instructions\n. Next, choose any random password and put it in \n/etc/awstats/password-file\n. Then tell Dave Dykstra the fully qualified domain name of your machine and the password you chose, and he'll set up the monitoring servers.",

Host choice:  -  Make sure there is adequate disk space for the repositories that will be served, at  /srv/cvmfs . Do not use xfs as the filesystem type on operating systems older than EL7, because it has been demonstrated to perform poorly for CVMFS repositories; instead use ext3 or ext4. About 10GB should be reserved for apache and squid logs under /var/log on a production server, although they normally will not get that large.

It describes the usage of tools provided by the Open Science Grid to evaluate the network performance between resources.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe Network Performance Toolkit is a collection of applications provided by the \nperfSONAR project\n and distributed by the \nOpen Science Grid\n. The \nserver\n components of the Network Performance Toolkit have been installed on dedicated resources of the \nOpen Science Grid\n. Following \nclient\n tools are described in this document:\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Diagnostic Tool (NDT)\n\n\nOne Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)\n\n\nBandwidth Control tool (BWCTL)\n\n\nNetwork Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD)\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nClient Site Installation\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nNote that BWCTL is \ndeprecated\n\n\n\n\nThe Network Performance Toolkit is installed with the OSG Client. Specifically, the tools included are: BWCTL, NDT and OWAMP (bwctl-client, bwctl-server, bwctl, ndt, owamp-client). NPAD is currently not in OSG client.\n\n\nIf you just want to install the OSG command line clients you can do the following::\n\n\nyum install bwctl-client\n\n\nyum install owamp-client\n\n\nyum install ndt-client\n\n\nyum install npad-client\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may install these utilities separately as RPM using yum by following the \nperfSONAR\n instructions. The packages are in the OSG repository, some of them with a separate client or server version, available for the OSG supported platforms:\n\n\n\n\nNDT: ndt\n\n\nOWAMP: owamp, owamp-client, owamp-server\n\n\nBWCTL: bwctl, bwctl-client, bwctl-server\n\n\nNPAD: npad\n\n\n\n\nServer Site Installation\n\n\nThe \nperfSONAR\n-based tools and services support the following tasks for OSG VO's:\n\n\n\n\nmonitor site-to-site network paths and ensure that these paths remain operational\n\n\ntroubleshoot performance problems quickly and efficiently\n\n\n\n\nThe \nserver site components\n can be brought-up \non demand\n using the netinstall provided by \nperfSONAR project downloads\n. Source packages are provided on the \nperfSONAR home page\n.\n\n\nOnce the Toolkit server has booted you may begin on-demand testing. The server tools will use a generic set of configuration files. The intent is to make it easy to stand up a temporary server when and where it is needed. However, it is expected that a permanently installed server will be customized/configured, allowing it to support both on-demand testing and regularly scheduled monitoring. See the \nperfSONAR home page\n for step-by-step instructions on how to complete this customization process.\n\n\nFinding Target Servers\n\n\nFinding servers against which to run on-demand tests can be a major impediment to effectively using these tools. The \nperfSONAR\n project tackles this problem by running a registration service for participating tools. The Performance Node ISO automatically uses this Lookup Service to advertise the tools' existence. You can also create custom views by making web-service calls to retrieve the data of interest. \n\n\nWe also have requested ALL OSG sites register their perfSONAR Toolkit installations in \nOIM\n. Using this list you can select a \"closest\" relevant instance to use for running on-demand tests. Alternately if you have a perfSONAR toolkit install, the web interface has a \"Global Services\" link you can visit to see ALL perfSONAR instances that have updated the perfSONAR lookup service.\n\n\nUsing the Client Tools\n\n\nThese tools support delay measurements (OWAMP), throughput measurements (BWCTL), and advanced diagnostics (NDT and NPAD). The command syntax for each tool is described in the following sub-sections. Each of the client tools listed above communicates with a companion server process to perform a measurement/test.\n\n\nNetwork Diagnostic Tool (NDT)\n\n\nThe Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) runs a series of short tests to determine what the current performance is and what, if anything, is limiting that performance. It can distinguish between host configuration and network infrastructure problems. To diagnose the CE/SE configuration and network connection run the \nweb100clt\n command:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n web100clt \u2013n \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore details can be obtained by using the \n-l\n command line option to \nweb100ctl\n:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n web100clt \u2013n \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n -l\n\n\n\n\n\nTo increase the output further use:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n web100clt \u2013n \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n -ll\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)\n\n\nThe One Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) is an advanced version of the common \nping\n program. The OWAMP client \nowping\n communicates with an OWAMP server and measures the delay in each direction using NTP based time stamps. OWAMP can be used to identify delay, loss, and packet reordering problems inside the network. To measure the delay between the CE/SE and the remote server use the \nowping\n command:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n owping \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBandwidth Control tool (BWCTL)\n\n\nThe Bandwidth Control tool (BWCTL) is a wrapper for the \niperf\n command, its policy and a daemon. BWCTL improves the usability of \niperf\n by avoiding following problems:\n\n\n\n\nneed for remote access to the target host used for measurement\n\n\nsecurity concerns about leaving an \niperf\n daemon running on the target host\n\n\n\n\nBWCTL supports testing in either direction, or between 2 remote BWCTL servers from a third location. To measure the current throughput from your SE/CE to the remote server use the \nbwctl\n command:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n bwctl \u2013s \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird party tests, between 2 remote BWCTL servers, will let you measure various sections of the end-2-end path, running\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n bwctl \u2013c \n1st Server \nfor\n Measurement\n \u2013s \n2nd Server \nfor\n Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther useful options are \n-f\n, format, \n-t\n, length of test, and \n-i\n, test interval.\n\n\nNetwork Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD)\n\n\nNOTE: Network Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD) is deprecated and won't be in future versions of the OSG distribution\n\n\nThe Network Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD) tool examines a host and its local network infrastructure to determine what problems, if any, would hinder wide area performance. Issues such as small TCP buffers in switches and routers are detected as well as common host configuration errors. To determine if the CE/SE will achieve maximum performance over a WAN path run the command \ndiag-client\n:\n\n\n[user@client /opt/npt]$\n diag-client \nTarget Server \nfor\n Measurement\n \n8001\n \n10\n \n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe last 2 numeric parameters, after host and port, are the rtt time (in ms) and speed/rate values (in Mbps) you need to achieve. The reason it works this way is that its meant to 'test' local infrastructure. The idea is that if you were testing to an NPAD server that was 5ms away on a 1G network, you would get close to that speed even with network flaws. If you were to supply 80ms and 1G to the server and there truly was a flaw, the NPAD test would tell you it wasn't possible, thus enabling you to fix the problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \ndiag-client\n commands return a partial URL, enabling easy sharing of results between users and site administrators. To view the results, prepend the Toolkit servers name/port to the returned string. The example above would result in this URL: \nhttp://server.this.osg.domain:8002/ServerData/Reports-2011-07/vtbv-ce.uchicago.edu:2011-07-12-18:50:07.html\n.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Topic: Scheduled Monitoring\n\n\n(See \nhttp://docs.perfsonar.net/install_quick_start.html\n for more details.)\n\n\nIn addition to the above on-demand tests, the Performance Toolkit server can be configured to continuously monitor the throughput or delay between your site and peer sites of interest.

            "text": "Troubleshooting Gratia Accounting\n\n\nThis document will help you troubleshoot problems with the Gratia Accounting, particularly with problems in collecting and reporting accounting information to the central OSG accounting service.\n\n\nGratia/GRACC: The Big Picture\n\n\nGratia is software used in OSG to gather accounting information. The information is collected from individual resources at a site, such as a Compute Element or a a submission host. The program that collects the data is called a \"Gratia probe\". The information is transferred to a GRACC server. Most sites will choose to send the accounting data to the central OSG Gratia server, but you can also use a Gratia server at your site (which can send forward the data to the central OSG Gratia server). Here is a diagram:\n\n\n\n\nDifference between Gratia and GRACC\n\n\nGratia is the legacy name of the OSG Accounting system.  GRACC is the new name of the server and hosted components of the accounting system.  When we refer to Gratia, we mean either the data or the probes on the resources.  If we mention GRACC, we are referring to the hosted components that the OSG maintains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the definitions of the major elements in the above figure.\n\n\n\n\nGratia probe\n: A piece of software that collects accounting data from the computer on which it's running, and transmits it to a Gratia server.\n\n\nGRACC server\n: A server that collects Gratia accounting data from one or more sites and can share it with users via a web page.  The GRACC server is hosted by the OSG.\n\n\nReporter\n: A web service running on the GRACC server. Users can connect to the reporter via a web browser to explore the Gratia data.\n\n\nCollector\n: A web service running on the GRACC server that collects data from one or more Gratia probes. Users do not directly interact with the collector.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the OSG's GRACC website at \nhttps://gracc.opensciencegrid.org\n.\n\n\nYou can see a fancier version of the Gratia data at \nhttps://display.opensciencegrid.org/\n. This is \nnot\n running a Gratia collector, but is a separate service.\n\n\nGratia Probes\n\n\nGratia Probes are periodically run as cron jobs, but different probes will run at different intervals. The cron jobs will always run and you should not remove them. You can find them in \n/etc/cron.d\n.\n\n\nHowever, the cron jobs will only do anything if you have enabled them. You enable them via an init script. For example, to enable them:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service gratia-probes-cron start\n\nEnabling gratia probes cron:                               [  OK  ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo disable them:\n\n\nroot@host #\n service gratia-probes-cron stop\n\nDisabling gratia probes cron:                               [  OK  ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also need to enable individual probes, usually via \nosg-configure\n.  Documentation on using \nosg-configure\n with Gratia \ndocumented elsewhere\n.\n\n\nRunning Gratia Probes\n\n\nWhen the cron jobs are enabled and run, they go through the following process, with minor changes between different Gratia probes:\n\n\n\n\nThe probe is invoked. It reads its configuration from \n/etc/gratia/PROBE-NAME/ProbeConfig\n.\n\n\nIt collects the accounting information from the underlying system. For example, the Condor probe will read it from the \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n, which is usually \n/var/lib/gratia/data\n.\n\n\nIt transforms the data into Gratia records and saves them into \n/var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/\n\n\nWhen there are sufficient Gratia records, or when sufficient time has passed, it uploads sets of records in batches to the GRACC server, then removes them from the \ngratiafiles\n directory.\n\n\nAll progress is logged to \n/var/log/gratia\n.\n\n\nIf there are failures in uploading the files to the GRACC server\n\n\nFiles are not removed from \ngratiafiles\n until they are successfully uploaded.\n\n\nErrors are logged to log files in \n/var/log/gratia\n.\n\n\nThe uploads will be tried again later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGratia Probe Configuration\n\n\nIn normal cases, \nosg-configure\n does the editing of the probe configuration files, at least on the CE. The configuration is found in \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-gratia.ini\n and \ndocumented elsewhere\n.\n\n\nIf there are problems or special configuration, you might need to edit the Gratia configuration files yourself. Each probe has a separate configuration file found in \n/etc/gratia/PROBE-NAME/ProbeConfig\n.\n\n\nThe ProbeConfig files have many details. A few options that you might need to edit are shown before. This is \nnot\n a complete file, but only shows a subset of the options.\n\n\nProbeConfiguration \n\n    CollectorHost=\ngratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80\n\n    SSLHost=\ngratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80\n\n    SSLRegistrationHost=\ngratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80\n\n\n    ProbeName=\ncondor:fermicloud084.fnal.gov\n\n    SiteName=\nWISC_OSG_EDU\n\n    EnableProbe=\n1\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe options you see here are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollectorHost\n\n\nThe GRACC server this probe reports to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSLHost\n\n\nThe GRACC server this probe reports to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSLRegistrationHost\n\n\nThe GRACC server this probe reports to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbeName\n\n\nThe unique name for this probe. Note that it includes the probe type and the host name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiteName\n\n\nThe name of your site, as registered in OIM. If your site must be registered in OIM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnableProbe\n\n\nThe probe will only run if this is \"1\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, there are many more options in this file. Most of the time you won't need to touch them.\n\n\nAre the Gratia cron jobs running?\n\n\nYou should make sure the Gratia cron jobs are running. The simplest way is with the \nservice\n command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /sbin/service gratia-probes-cron status\n\ngratia probes cron is enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it is not enabled, enable it as described above.\n\n\nA future release of Gratia will provide status on each of the individual probes, but right now this only ensures that the basic cron job is running. In the meantime, you can check if the individual Gratia probes are enabled. To do this, look at the \nEnableProbe\n option in the \nProbeConfig\n file, as described above. A quick command to do this is shown here. Note that the Condor and GridFTP Transfer probes are enabled while the glexec probe is disabled:\n\n\nroot@host #\n \ncd\n /etc/gratia\n\nroot@host #\n grep -r EnableProbe *\n\ncondor/ProbeConfig:    EnableProbe=\n1\n\n\nglexec/ProbeConfig:    EnableProbe=\n0\n\n\ngridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig:    EnableProbe=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see no log files in \n/var/log/gratia\n you may have an error in the probe configuration file. Manually run the test for your probe (check \n/etc/cron.d/gratia-probe-condor.cron\n), e.g. \n/usr/share/gratia/common/cron_check  /etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n. If there is an error you may get a suggestion on where it is, e.g.:\n\n\nroot@host #\n /usr/share/gratia/common/cron_check  /etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig\n\nParse error in /etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig: not well-formed (invalid token): line 21, column 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect the error and restart gratia.\n\n\nHave you configured the resource names correctly?\n\n\nDo the names of your resources match the names in \nOIM\n?\nGratia retrieves the resource name from the \nSite Information\n section of the \n/etc/osg/config.d/40-siteinfo.ini\n\n\n;===================================================================\n;                       Site Information\n;===================================================================\n\n[Site Information]\n; The group option indicates the group that the OSG site should be listed in,\n; for production sites this should be OSG, for vtb or itb testing it should be\n; OSG-ITB\n; \n; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS\ngroup = OSG\n\n; The host_name setting should give the host name of the CE  that is being \n; configured, this setting must be a valid dns name that resolves\n; \n; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS\nhost_name = tusker-gw1.unl.edu\n\n; The resource setting should be set to the same value as used in the OIM \n; registration at the goc \n; \n; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS\nresource = Tusker-CE1\n\n; The resource_group setting should be set to the same value as used in the OIM \n; registration at the goc \n; \n; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS\nresource_group = Tusker\n\n\n\n\n\nDo those names match the names that you registered with OIM? If not, edit the names, and rerun \"osg-configure -c\".\n\n\nDid the site name change?\n\n\nWas the site previously reporting data, but the site name (not host name, but site name) changed? When the site name changes, you need to ask the GRACC operations team to update the name of your site at the GRACC collector. To do this:\n\n\n\n\nOpen a \nsupport ticket\n\n\nSelect \"Software or Service\"\n\n\nSelect \"GRACC Operations\"\n\n\nType a friendly email that asks the GRACC team to change your site name at the collector. Make sure to tell them the old name and the new name.  Below is an example email:\nHello GRACC Team,\n\nPlease change the site name of my site from \nInsert Old Name\n to \nInsert New Name\n.\n\nThanks, ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs a site reporting data?\n\n\nYou can see if the OSG GRACC Server is getting data from a site by going to \nGRACC\n:\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the site name in Facility\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor's Gratia Configuration\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOnly applicable to HTCondor batch sites, not SLURM, PBS, SGE or LSF sites\n\n\n\n\nCondor must be configured to put information about each job into a special directory.  Gratia will read and remove the files in order to collect the accounting information.\n\n\nThe configuration variable is called \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n. If you install the OSG RPM for Condor, the Gratia probe will extend its configuration by adding a file to \n/etc/condor/config.d\n, and will set this variable to \n/var/lib/gratia/data\n. If you are using a different installation method, you may need to set the variable yourself. You can check if it's set by using \ncondor_config_val\n, like this:\n\n\nuser@host $\n condor_config_val -v PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n\nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR: /var/lib/gratia/data\n\n\n    Defined in \n/etc/condor/config.d/99_gratia.conf\n, line 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set this value, you need to restart condor:\n\n\nroot@host #\n condor_restart\n\nSent \nRestart\n command to local master\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike many Condor settings, a \ncondor_reconfig\n is not sufficient - you must restart!\n\n\nIf you accidentally did not set \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n (see above)\n\n\nThe HTCondor Gratia probe will not publish accounting information about jobs without \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n.

There are a few things you need to do. But first, you need to understand exactly where Gratia stores files.\n\n\nWhen a Gratia extracts accounting information, it creates one file per record and stores it in a directory. The directory is a long name that contains the type of the probe (such as \ncondor\n), the name of the host you're running on, and the name of the GRACC host you're sending the information to. For simplicity, lets call that name \nPROBE-RECORDS\n, but you'll see what it really looks like below. Within this directory, you'll see some subdirectories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectory\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/lib/gratia/tmp/grataifiles/\nPROBE-RECORDS\n/outbox\n\n\nThe usual location for the accounting records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/lib/gratia/tmp/grataifiles/\nPROBE-RECORDS\n/staged/store\n\n\nAn overflow location when there are problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you recover old records, you need to:\n\n\n\n\nMove files from the outbox of the incorrect \nprobe-records\n directory into the outbox of the correctly named \nprobe-records\n directory.\n\n\nMove tarred and compressed files from the staged/store of the incorrect \nprobe-records\n directory into the staged/store of the correctly named \nprobe-records\n directory. Then you uncompress them and remove the compressed version.\n\n\n\n\nIn the examples below, the hostname for gratia was \"accidentally\" spelled backwards. Instead of \ngratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org\n, it was \naitarg-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst you need to fix the hostname. For a CE, you can edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-gratia.ini\n and rerun \nosg-configure -c\n. In other installations, you have to edit the appropriate \nProbeConfig\n file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, submit a job via to your batch system, then run the appropriate Gratia probe (or wait for it to run via cron). This will create the properly named directories on your disk. For example:\n\n\nAs a user: \n\n\nuser@host $\n globus-job-run fermicloud084.fnal.gov/jobmanager-condor /bin/hostname\n\n\n\n\n\nAs root (adjust for your batch system): \n\n\nroot@host #\n /share/gratia/condor/condor\n\\_\nmeter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the Gratia records that can be easily uploaded. They are located in a a directory with an unwieldly name that\nincludes your hostname and the incorrect name of the Gratia host. You can see the directory name in the Gratia log: the\nmisspelled name is between angled brackets and capital letters below, but \nit will be different on your computer\n.\n\n\nuser@host $\n less /var/log/gratia/2012-04-06\n\n...\n\n\n16:04:29 CDT Gratia: Response indicates failure, the following files will not be deleted:\n\n\n16:04:29 CDT Gratia:    /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/\n\n\n    subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_\nAITARG\n-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/\n\n\n    outbox/r.916.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_aitarg-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80.gratia.xml__JDlHbNb918\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(The filename was wrapped for legibility.)\n\n\nYou can simply copy these to the correct directory.

After a while, they are put into a compressed files in another directory. You can move those files, then uncompress them. This is a long name: note that the path ends in \"staged/store\" instead of \"outbox\" as above:\n\n\n#\n Find the old files\n\nroot@host #\n \ncd\n /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_\nAITARG\n-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/staged/store\n\n\n#\n Move them to the correct directory\n\nroot@host #\n mv tz* /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/outbox/.\n\nroot@host #\n \ncd\n !$\n\n\n#\n For each tz file:\n\nroot@host #\n tar xf tz.1223.... \n[\nname shortened \nfor\n legibility\n]\n\n\nroot@host #\n rm tz.1223....\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you've done this, you can re-run the Gratia probe by hand, or wait for it to run via cron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Important Gratia files\n\n\nIf you need to look for more data, you can look at log files for the various services on your CE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/log/gratia/\nDATE\n.log\n\n\nLog file that records information about processing and uploading of Gratia accounting data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/log/gratia/gridftpTransfer.log\n\n\nLog file specific to the Gratia GridFTP probe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/lib/gratia/data\n\n\nLocation for Condor and PBS job data before being processed by Gratia\nCondor's \nPER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR\n should be set to this location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles\n\n\nLocation for temporary Gratia data as it is being processed, usually empty.\nIf you have files that are more than 30 minutes old in this directory, there may be a problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/gratia/\nPROBE-NAME\n/ProbeConfig\n\n\nConfiguration for Gratia probes, one per probe type\nNormally you don't need to edit this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all RPMs will be on all hosts.

This can be done, though it's not simple. There are a few things you need to do. But first, you need to understand exactly where Gratia stores files.  When a Gratia extracts accounting information, it creates one file per record and stores it in a directory. The directory is a long name that contains the type of the probe (such as  condor ), the name of the host you're running on, and the name of the GRACC host you're sending the information to. For simplicity, lets call that name  PROBE-RECORDS , but you'll see what it really looks like below. Within this directory, you'll see some subdirectories:     Directory  Purpose      /var/lib/gratia/tmp/grataifiles/ PROBE-RECORDS /outbox  The usual location for the accounting records    /var/lib/gratia/tmp/grataifiles/ PROBE-RECORDS /staged/store  An overflow location when there are problems     When you recover old records, you need to:   Move files from the outbox of the incorrect  probe-records  directory into the outbox of the correctly named  probe-records  directory.  Move tarred and compressed files from the staged/store of the incorrect  probe-records  directory into the staged/store of the correctly named  probe-records  directory. Then you uncompress them and remove the compressed version.   In the examples below, the hostname for gratia was \"accidentally\" spelled backwards. Instead of  gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org , it was  aitarg-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org .    First you need to fix the hostname. For a CE, you can edit  /etc/osg/config.d/30-gratia.ini  and rerun  osg-configure -c . In other installations, you have to edit the appropriate  ProbeConfig  file.    Next, submit a job via to your batch system, then run the appropriate Gratia probe (or wait for it to run via cron). This will create the properly named directories on your disk. For example:  As a user:   user@host $  globus-job-run fermicloud084.fnal.gov/jobmanager-condor /bin/hostname  As root (adjust for your batch system):   root@host #  /share/gratia/condor/condor \\_ meter    Find the Gratia records that can be easily uploaded. They are located in a a directory with an unwieldly name that\nincludes your hostname and the incorrect name of the Gratia host. You can see the directory name in the Gratia log: the\nmisspelled name is between angled brackets and capital letters below, but  it will be different on your computer .  user@host $  less /var/log/gratia/2012-04-06 ...  16:04:29 CDT Gratia: Response indicates failure, the following files will not be deleted:  16:04:29 CDT Gratia:    /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/      subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_ AITARG -osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/      outbox/r.916.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_aitarg-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80.gratia.xml__JDlHbNb918   (The filename was wrapped for legibility.)  You can simply copy these to the correct directory. Wait for the Gratia cron job to run, or force it to run.  root@host #   cd  /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_ AITARG -osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/outbox/. root@host #  mv * /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/outbox/.    If this has been a persistent problem, you might have many records. After a while, they are put into a compressed files in another directory. You can move those files, then uncompress them. This is a long name: note that the path ends in \"staged/store\" instead of \"outbox\" as above:  #  Find the old files root@host #   cd  /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_ AITARG -osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/staged/store #  Move them to the correct directory root@host #  mv tz* /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/subdir.condor_fermicloud084.fnal.gov_gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org_80/outbox/. root@host #   cd  !$ #  For each tz file: root@host #  tar xf tz.1223....

ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4 end-of-life\n\n\nAs a result of this initial OSG 3.5 release, the end-of-life dates have been set for OSG 3.4 per our\n\npolicy\n:\nregular support will end in \nFebruary 2020\n and critical bug/security support will end in \nNovember 2020\n.\n\n\n\n\nPackage updates\n\n\nIn addition to the packages that were carried over from \nOSG 3.4.33\n,\nthis release contains the following package updates:\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor 8.8.4: The current HTCondor \nstable release\n.\n    See the \nmanual update instructions\n before\n    updating to this version.\n    Some highlights from

developers:\n\n\n\n\nAs with previous releases, upgrading clients should be seamless just by installing the new package from the\nrepository.\nAs usual, we recommend to update only a few worker nodes first and gradually ramp up once the new version proves\nto work correctly.\nPlease take special care when upgrading a cvmfs client in NFS mode.\n\n\nFor Stratum 1 servers, there should be no running snapshots during the upgrade.\nFor publisher and gateway nodes, all transactions must be closed and no active leases must be present before\nupgrading.\n\n\n\n\nSee the known issue with this version

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.\n\n\nThe StashCache service is only supported on EL7\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

GT2/GT5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor new Singularity features introduced in GlideinWMS 3.4.1, all factories and frontends need to be \n= 3.4.1.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOSG GlideinWMS factories are running at least 3.4.1\n\n\n\n\nIf some of the connected Factories are \n= 3.4.1 you will see an error during reconfig/upgrade if you try to use\nfeatures that require a newer Factory.\nTo start using Singularity via GlideinWMS, see:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/frontend/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/custom_vars.html#singularity_vars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrades from \n= 3.4.0 may require merging \n/etc/condor/config.d/*.rpmnew\n files and restarting HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS \n= 3.4.5 uses shared port, requiring only port 9618.\n   To ease the transition to shared port, the User Collector, secondary collectors, and CCBs support both shared and\n   separate, individual ports.\n   To start using shared port, change the secondary collectors lines and the CCBs lines (if any) in\n   \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n, changing the address to include the shared port sinful string:\n\n\ncollector DN=\n/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=gwms-frontend.domain\n group=\ndefault\n node=\ngwms-frontend.domain:9618?sock=collector0-40\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \ngwms-frontend-domain\n above with the hostname of your GlideinWMS frontend.\nSee the \nGlideinWMS documentation\n for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nOSG System Profiler verifies all installed packages, which may result in\n\nexcessively long run times\n.\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.\n\n\nThe StashCache service is only supported on EL7\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS 3.4.6 is the last release supporting Globus GRAM (a.k.a. GT2/GT5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor new Singularity features introduced in GlideinWMS 3.4.1, all factories and frontends need to be \n= 3.4.1.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOSG GlideinWMS factories are running at least 3.4.1\n\n\n\n\nIf some of the connected Factories are \n= 3.4.1 you will see an error during reconfig/upgrade if you try to use\nfeatures that require a newer Factory.\nTo start using Singularity via GlideinWMS, see:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/frontend/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/custom_vars.html#singularity_vars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrades from \n= 3.4.0 may require merging \n/etc/condor/config.d/*.rpmnew\n files and restarting HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS \n= 3.4.5 uses shared port, requiring only port 9618.\n   To ease the transition to shared port, the User Collector, secondary collectors, and CCBs support both shared and\n   separate, individual ports.\n   To start using shared port, change the secondary collectors lines and the CCBs lines (if any) in\n   \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n, changing the address to include the shared port sinful string:\n\n\ncollector DN=\n/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=gwms-frontend.domain\n group=\ndefault\n node=\ngwms-frontend.domain:9618?sock=collector0-40\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \ngwms-frontend-domain\n above with the hostname of your GlideinWMS frontend.\nSee the \nGlideinWMS documentation\n for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nOSG System Profiler verifies all installed packages, which may result in\n\nexcessively long run times\n.\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

GT2/GT5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor new Singularity features introduced in GlideinWMS 3.4.1, all factories and frontends need to be \n= 3.4.1.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOSG GlideinWMS factories are running at least 3.4.1\n\n\n\n\nIf some of the connected Factories are \n= 3.4.1 you will see an error during reconfig/upgrade if you try to use\nfeatures that require a newer Factory.\nTo start using Singularity via GlideinWMS, see:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/frontend/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/custom_vars.html#singularity_vars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrades from \n= 3.4.0 may require merging \n/etc/condor/config.d/*.rpmnew\n files and restarting HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS \n= 3.4.5 uses shared port, requiring only port 9618.\n   To ease the transition to shared port, the User Collector, secondary collectors, and CCBs support both shared and\n   separate, individual ports.\n   To start using shared port, change the secondary collectors lines and the CCBs lines (if any) in\n   \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n, changing the address to include the shared port sinful string:\n\n\ncollector DN=\n/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=gwms-frontend.domain\n group=\ndefault\n node=\ngwms-frontend.domain:9618?sock=collector0-40\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \ngwms-frontend-domain\n above with the hostname of your GlideinWMS frontend.\nSee the \nGlideinWMS documentation\n for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nOSG System Profiler verifies all installed packages, which may result in\n\nexcessively long run times\n.\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

GT2/GT5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor new Singularity features introduced in GlideinWMS 3.4.1, all factories and frontends need to be \n= 3.4.1.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOSG GlideinWMS factories are running at least 3.4.1\n\n\n\n\nIf some of the connected Factories are \n= 3.4.1 you will see an error during reconfig/upgrade if you try to use\nfeatures that require a newer Factory.\nTo start using Singularity via GlideinWMS, see:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/frontend/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/custom_vars.html#singularity_vars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrades from \n= 3.4.0 may require merging \n/etc/condor/config.d/*.rpmnew\n files and a restart of HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS \n= 3.4.5 uses shared port, requiring only port 9618.\n   To ease the transition to shared port, the User Collector secondary collectors and CCBs support both shared and\n   separate, individual ports.\n   To start using shared port, change the secondary collectors lines and the CCBs lines (if any) in\n   \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n, changing the address to include the shared port sinful string:\n\n\ncollector DN=\n/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=gwms-frontend.domain\n group=\ndefault\n node=\ngwms-frontend.domain:9618?sock=collector0-40\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ngwms-frontend-domain\n with the hostname of your GlideinWMS frontend.\nSee the \nGlideinWMS documentation\n for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nOSG System Profiler verifies all installed packages, which may result in\n\nexcessively long run times\n.\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.\n\n\nStashCache is only supported on EL7\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS 3.4.6 is the last release supporting Globus GRAM (a.k.a. GT2/GT5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor new Singularity features introduced in GlideinWMS 3.4.1, all factories and frontends need to be \n= 3.4.1.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOSG GlideinWMS factories are running at least 3.4.1\n\n\n\n\nIf some of the connected Factories are \n= 3.4.1 you will see an error during reconfig/upgrade if you try to use\nfeatures that require a newer Factory.\nTo start using Singularity via GlideinWMS, see:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/frontend/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/custom_vars.html#singularity_vars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrades from \n= 3.4.0 may require merging \n/etc/condor/config.d/*.rpmnew\n files and a restart of HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS \n= 3.4.5 uses shared port, requiring only port 9618.\n   To ease the transition to shared port, the User Collector secondary collectors and CCBs support both shared and\n   separate, individual ports.\n   To start using shared port, change the secondary collectors lines and the CCBs lines (if any) in\n   \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n, changing the address to include the shared port sinful string:\n\n\ncollector DN=\n/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=gwms-frontend.domain\n group=\ndefault\n node=\ngwms-frontend.domain:9618?sock=collector0-40\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ngwms-frontend-domain\n with the hostname of your GlideinWMS frontend.\nSee the \nGlideinWMS documentation\n for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nOSG System Profiler verifies all installed packages, which may result in\n\nexcessively long run times\n.\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.\n\n\nStashCache is only supported on EL7\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS 3.4.5 is the last release supporting Globus GRAM (a.k.a. GT2/GT5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor new Singularity features introduced in GlideinWMS 3.4.1, all factories and frontends need to be \n= 3.4.1.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOSG GlideinWMS factories are running at least 3.4.1\n\n\n\n\nIf some of the connected Factories are \n= 3.4.1 you will see an error during reconfig/upgrade if you try to use\nfeatures that require a newer Factory.\nTo start using Singularity via GlideinWMS, see:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/frontend/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/custom_vars.html#singularity_vars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrades from \n= 3.4.0 may require merging \n/etc/condor/config.d/*.rpmnew\n files and a restart of HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS \n= 3.4.5 uses shared port, requiring only port 9618.\n   To ease the transition to shared port, the User Collector secondary collectors and CCBs support both shared and\n   separate, individual ports.\n   To start using shared port, change the secondary collectors lines and the CCBs lines (if any) in\n   \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n, changing the address to include the shared port sinful string:\n\n\ncollector DN=\n/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=gwms-frontend.domain\n group=\ndefault\n node=\ngwms-frontend.domain:9618?sock=collector0-40\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ngwms-frontend-domain\n with the hostname of your GlideinWMS frontend.\nSee the \nGlideinWMS documentation\n for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nOSG System Profiler verifies all installed packages, which may result in\n\nexcessively long run times\n.\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.\n\n\nStashCache is only supported on EL7\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS 3.4.5 is the last release supporting Globus GRAM (a.k.a. GT2/GT5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor new Singularity features introduced in GlideinWMS 3.4.1, all factories and frontends need to be \n= 3.4.1.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOSG GlideinWMS factories are running at least 3.4.1\n\n\n\n\nIf some of the connected Factories are \n= 3.4.1 you will see an error during reconfig/upgrade if you try to use\nfeatures that require a newer Factory.\nTo start using Singularity via GlideinWMS, see:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/frontend/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/custom_vars.html#singularity_vars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrades from \n= 3.4.0 may require merging \n/etc/condor/config.d/*.rpmnew\n files and a restart of HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS \n= 3.4.5 uses shared port, requiring only port 9618.\n   To ease the transition to shared port, the User Collector secondary collectors and CCBs support both shared and\n   separate, individual ports.\n   To start using shared port, change the secondary collectors lines and the CCBs lines (if any) in\n   \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n, changing the address to include the shared port sinful string:\n\n\ncollector DN=\n/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=gwms-frontend.domain\n group=\ndefault\n node=\ngwms-frontend.domain:9618?sock=collector0-40\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ngwms-frontend-domain\n with the hostname of your GlideinWMS frontend.\nSee the \nGlideinWMS documentation\n for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension.

GT2/GT5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor new Singularity features introduced in GlideinWMS 3.4.1, all factories and frontends need to be \n= 3.4.1.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOSG GlideinWMS factories are running at least 3.4.1\n\n\n\n\nIf some of the connected Factories are \n= 3.4.1 you will see an error during reconfig/upgrade if you try to use\nfeatures that require a newer Factory.\nTo start using Singularity via GlideinWMS, see:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/frontend/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/custom_vars.html#singularity_vars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrades from \n= 3.4.0 may require merging \n/etc/condor/config.d/*.rpmnew\n files and a restart of HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS \n= 3.4.5 uses shared port, requiring only port 9618.\n   To ease the transition to shared port, the User Collector secondary collectors and CCBs support both shared and\n   separate, individual ports.\n   To start using shared port, change the secondary collectors lines and the CCBs lines (if any) in\n   \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n, changing the address to include the shared port sinful string:\n\n\ncollector DN=\n/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=gwms-frontend.domain\n group=\ndefault\n node=\ngwms-frontend.domain:9618?sock=collector0-40\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ngwms-frontend-domain\n with the hostname of your GlideinWMS frontend.\nSee the \nGlideinWMS documentation\n for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nNone.\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created.

XCache is also the basis of upcoming work\n    for connecting caches to the CMS and ATLAS data federations.\n\n\nThe configuration has been rewritten to use \nconfig.d\n-style directories\ninstead of single config files, and supporting services have been added\nto do the following:\n\n\n\n\nupdate authorization for both caches and origins based on data in the\n    OSG Topology service\n\n\nautomatically renew cache proxies\n\n\n\n\nThis \noverview document\n\ncontains links to instructions for setting up new\ncaches and origins, and instructions for VOs on how to get their data\ninto the StashCache Federation.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXCache is only available for EL7, and EL7 is now a requirement for\n    a cache or origin to join the StashCache Data Federation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the extensive changes to the configuration, sites upgrading\n    their caches or origins to this version should consider the upgrade to\n    be the same amount of work as a reinstall of the service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate MyProxy to use the Grid Community Toolkit (GCT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nThis section describes important upgrade notes and/or caveats for packages available in the OSG release repositories.\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.\n\n\nStashCache is only supported on EL7\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS 3.4.5 is the last release supporting Globus GRAM (a.k.a. GT2/GT5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor new Singularity features introduced in GlideinWMS 3.4.1, all factories and frontends need to be \n= 3.4.1.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOSG GlideinWMS factories are running at least 3.4.1\n\n\n\n\nIf some of the connected Factories are \n= 3.4.1 you will see an error during reconfig/upgrade if you try to use\nfeatures that require a newer Factory.\nTo start using Singularity via GlideinWMS, see:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/frontend/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/custom_vars.html#singularity_vars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrades from \n= 3.4.0 may require merging \n/etc/condor/config.d/*.rpmnew\n files and a restart of HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS \n= 3.4.5 uses shared port, requiring only port 9618.\n   To ease the transition to shared port, the User Collector secondary collectors and CCBs support both shared and\n   separate, individual ports.\n   To start using shared port, change the secondary collectors lines and the CCBs lines (if any) in\n   \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n, changing the address to include the shared port sinful string:\n\n\ncollector DN=\n/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=gwms-frontend.domain\n group=\ndefault\n node=\ngwms-frontend.domain:9618?sock=collector0-40\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ngwms-frontend-domain\n with the hostname of your GlideinWMS frontend.\nSee the \nGlideinWMS documentation\n for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nDue to the central RSV service retirement (see \nthis document\n for details),\nthe new version of RSV will disable the \ngratia-consumer\n component that reports to the central service.\nPlease update \nall\n RSV packages by running the following command on your RSV host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update rsv\n\\*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you are using osg-configure, please edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and set the following:\n\n\nenable_gratia = False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.\n\n\nStashCache is only supported on EL7\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS 3.4.5 is the last release supporting Globus GRAM (a.k.a. GT2/GT5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor new Singularity features introduced in GlideinWMS 3.4.1, all factories and frontends need to be \n= 3.4.1.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOSG GlideinWMS factories are running at least 3.4.1\n\n\n\n\nIf some of the connected Factories are \n= 3.4.1 you will see an error during reconfig/upgrade if you try to use\nfeatures that require a newer Factory.\nTo start using Singularity via GlideinWMS, see:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/frontend/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/configuration.html#singularity\n\n\nhttps://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/custom_vars.html#singularity_vars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrades from \n= 3.4.0 may require merging \n/etc/condor/config.d/*.rpmnew\n files and a restart of HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlideinWMS \n= 3.4.5 uses shared port, requiring only port 9618.\n   To ease the transition to shared port, the User Collector secondary collectors and CCBs support both shared and\n   separate, individual ports.\n   To start using shared port, change the secondary collectors lines and the CCBs lines (if any) in\n   \n/etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml\n, changing the address to include the shared port sinful string:\n\n\ncollector DN=\n/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=gwms-frontend.domain\n group=\ndefault\n node=\ngwms-frontend.domain:9618?sock=collector0-40\n secondary=\nTrue\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \ngwms-frontend-domain\n with the hostname of your GlideinWMS frontend.\nSee the \nGlideinWMS documentation\n for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nDue to the central RSV service retirement (see \nthis document\n for details),\nthe new version of RSV will disable the \ngratia-consumer\n component that reports to the central service.\nPlease update \nall\n RSV packages by running the following command on your RSV host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update rsv\n\\*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you are using osg-configure, please edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and set the following:\n\n\nenable_gratia = False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nDue to the central RSV service retirement (see \nthis document\n for details),\nthe new version of RSV will disable the \ngratia-consumer\n component that reports to the central service.\nPlease update \nall\n RSV packages by running the following command on your RSV host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update rsv\n\\*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you are using osg-configure, please edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and set the following:\n\n\nenable_gratia = False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nDue to the central RSV service retirement (see \nthis document\n for details),\nthe new version of RSV will disable the \ngratia-consumer\n component that reports to the central service.\nPlease update \nall\n RSV packages by running the following command on your RSV host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update rsv\n\\*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you are using osg-configure, please edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and set the following:\n\n\nenable_gratia = False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.

That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).

Glidein lifetime is no longer based on the length of the proxy  New option to kill glideins when the number of job requests drop  Estimate in advance how many cores will be provided to glideins  Add entry monitoring breakdown for metasites  Review Factory and Frontend tools, especially glidien_off and manual_glidein_submit.py  Singularity improvements  Use PATH and module when SINGULARITY_BIN does not contain the correct path  Run in a separate session to support restricted-access CVMFS      Notes   All nodes  GLIDEIN_ToDie is no longer shortened depending on the X509 proxy lifetime, to get the old behavior set GLIDEIN_Ignore_X509_Duration to False  The type of the GLIDEIN_CPU attr is String (to accomodate the keywords auto, slot, node). It was incorrectly documented as type Int. Make sure your configuration uses the correct type or you may get a reconfig/upgrade error.    Factory only:  If you use HTCondor 8.7.2 or later with the GlideinWMS Factory, then GRAM gateways are no longer supported  'entry_sets' should be considered an experimental feature: the implementation will change in 3.4.1 and there may be errors and manual interventions required when upgrading to new versions of GlideinWMS if metasites are configured        BLAHP: Improved security      These  JIRA tickets  were addressed in this release.   Notes   OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.  StashCache is supported on EL7 only.  xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.    Detailed changes are below.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nDue to the central RSV service retirement (see \nthis document\n for details),\nthe new version of RSV will disable the \ngratia-consumer\n component that reports to the central service.\nPlease update \nall\n RSV packages by running the following command on your RSV host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update rsv\n\\*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you are using osg-configure, please edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and set the following:\n\n\nenable_gratia = False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

This new format first appeared in OSG PKI tools version 2.1.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nDue to the central RSV service retirement (see \nthis document\n for details),\nthe new version of RSV will disable the \ngratia-consumer\n component that reports to the central service.\nPlease update \nall\n RSV packages by running the following command on your RSV host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update rsv\n\\*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you are using osg-configure, please edit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and set the following:\n\n\nenable_gratia = False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.

That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.

Notes   OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.  StashCache is supported on EL7 only.  xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.  OSG PKI tools now create service certificate files where the service tag is separated from the hostname with an underscore ( _ ). This new format first appeared in OSG PKI tools version 2.1.2.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

Notes   OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.  StashCache is supported on EL7 only.  xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.  OSG PKI tools now create service certificate files where the service tag is separated from the hostname with an underscore ('_'). This new format first appeared in OSG PKI tools version 2.1.2.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the November release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the October release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository. Note that in some cases, there are multiple RPMs for each package.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

This option must be used when the disambiguation code does not correctly determine which PBS is in use.\n\n\nReorganize the osg-ce packages \nSOFTWARE-2768\n\n\nUpcoming: patched HTCondor 8.7.2\n\n\nUpdated SELinux profile which is required on Red Hat 7.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.\n\n\nStashCache is supported on EL7 only.\n\n\nxrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details.\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the August release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: \nWARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details.\n. This warning can safely be ignored.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the August release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the  .rpmnew  file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the  .rpmnew  extension).

Specifically, the varied authentication solutions proved to be good candidates for consolidation and a new piece of software, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, has been designed to replace both edg-mkgridmap and GUMS.\n\n\nSee \ninstall the LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n to replace GUMS + edg-mkgridmap.\n\n\nSee \nmigrating from edg-mkgridmap to lcmaps VOMS plugin\n to transistion from edg-mkgridmap.\n\n\nIn 3.4.0, we dropped HDFS 2.x with the intention of adding HDFS 3.x in a subsequent OSG 3.4 release when it becomes available upstream.\n\n\nIn addition to GUMS, edg-mkgridmap, and HDFS 2.x, we dropped packages related to the following software:\n\n\n\n\nVOMS Admin Server - \nRetirement Policy\n\n\nBeStMan - replaced by \nLoad Balanced GridFTP\n\n\nGLExec - replaced by \nSingularty\n\n\nGlobus GRAM available from EPEL\n\n\nGIP and OSG Info Services BDII servers retired\n\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned packages are still be available in OSG 3.3 and will receive regular support until December 2017 and security updates until June 2018 per our \nrelease policy\n. See \nthis section\n for the complete list of packages removed from OSG 3.4.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.\n\n\nStashCache is supported on EL7 only.\n\n\nxrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of changes\n\n\nThis release contains:\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4.0\n\n\nHTCondor 8.6.3\n: See \nUpgrading from 8.4\n for additional information\n\n\nFrontier squid 3.5.24-3.1\n: See \nUpgrading from 2.x to 3.x\n for additional information\n\n\nUpdate to \nXRootD 4.6.1\n\n\nUpdate to xrootd-lcmaps 1.3.3 for EL7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate StashCache meta-packages to require XRootD 4.6.1\n\n\nUpdate to \nGlideinWMS 3.2.19\n\n\nMake the LCMAPS VOMS plugin consider only the first FQAN to be consistent with GUMS\n\n\nHTCondor-CE: Add WholeNodeWanted ClassAd expression so jobs can request a whole node from the batch system\n\n\nHTCondor 8.6.3\n: See \nUpgrading from 8.4\n for additional information\n\n\nOSG CE 3.4\n\n\nAdd vo-client-lcmaps-voms dependency\n\n\nRemove gridftp dependency\n\n\nDrop client tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd vo-client-lcmaps-voms dependency to osg-gridftp\n\n\nFix osg-update-vos script to clean yum cache in order pick up the latest vo-client RPM\n\n\nosg-ca-scripts now refers to repo.grid.iu.edu (rather than the retired software.grid.iu.edu)\n\n\nosg-configure 2.0.0\n\n\nreject empty \nallowed_vos\n in subclusters\n\n\nget default \nallowed_vos\n from LCMAPS VOMS plugin\n\n\nissue warning (rather than error out) if OSG_APP or OSG_DATA directories are not present\n\n\ndrop 'RSV is not installed' warning\n\n\nremove configure-osg alias\n\n\ndeprecate GUMS support\n\n\ndisable GRAM configuration\n\n\ndrop managedfork and network modules\n\n\ndrop glexec support\n\n\nremove nonfunctional osg-cleanup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrop glexec and java from osg-wn-client\n\n\nBeSTMan 2 is no longer part of the OSG Software Stack\n\n\nGUMS is no longer part of the OSG Software Stack\n\n\nedg-mkgridmap in no longer part of the OSG Software Stack\n\n\nDrop bestman2 and globus*run RSV metrics\n\n\nosg-build 1.10.0\n\n\ndrop vdt-build alias\n\n\ndrop ~/.osg-build.ini configuration file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese \nJIRA tickets\n were addressed in this release.\n\n\nDetailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found \nhere\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, OSG 3.4 CEs cannot be configured to authenticate via GUMS (\nSOFTWARE-2482\n). This issue is expected to be fixed in the July release.\n\n\nUsing the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing \"supported VO\" RSV test (\nSOFTWARE-2763\n). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the July release.\n\n\nIn GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\n\n\n\n\nCOLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to the new release\n\n\nUpdate Repositories\n\n\nTo update to this series, you need to to \ninstall the current OSG repositories\n.\n\n\nUpdate Software\n\n\nOnce the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a \n.rpmnew\n extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension). Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nDo you need help with this release? \nContact us for help\n.\n\n\nDetailed changes in this release\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nWe added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.

            "text": "The OSG 3.4.0 software stack features a more streamlined and consolidated package list. Specifically, the varied authentication solutions proved to be good candidates for consolidation and a new piece of software, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, has been designed to replace both edg-mkgridmap and GUMS.  See  install the LCMAPS VOMS plugin  to replace GUMS + edg-mkgridmap.  See  migrating from edg-mkgridmap to lcmaps VOMS plugin  to transistion from edg-mkgridmap.  In 3.4.0, we dropped HDFS 2.x with the intention of adding HDFS 3.x in a subsequent OSG 3.4 release when it becomes available upstream.  In addition to GUMS, edg-mkgridmap, and HDFS 2.x, we dropped packages related to the following software:   VOMS Admin Server -  Retirement Policy  BeStMan - replaced by  Load Balanced GridFTP  GLExec - replaced by  Singularty  Globus GRAM available from EPEL  GIP and OSG Info Services BDII servers retired   The aforementioned packages are still be available in OSG 3.3 and will receive regular support until December 2017 and security updates until June 2018 per our  release policy . See  this section  for the complete list of packages removed from OSG 3.4.   Notes   OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.  StashCache is supported on EL7 only.  xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.",

Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a  .rpmnew  file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a  .rpmnew  extension.

            "text": "OSG Release Series\n\n\nAn OSG release series is a sequence of OSG software releases that are intended to provide a painless upgrade path.\nFor example, the 3.2 release series contains OSG software 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and so forth.\nA release series corresponds to a set of Yum software repositories, including ones for development, testing, and\nproduction use.\nThe Yum repositories for one release series are completely distinct from the repositories for a different release\nseries, even though they share many common packages.\nA particular release within a series is a snapshot of packages and their exact versions at one point in time.\nWhen you install software from a release series, say 3.2, you get the most current versions of software packages within\nthat series, regardless of the current release version.\n\n\nWhen a new series is released, it is an opportunity for the OSG Technology area to add major new software packages, make\nsubstantial updates to existing packages, and remove obsolete packages.\nWhen a new series is initially released, most packages are identical to the previous release, but two adjacent series\nwill diverge over time.\n\n\nOur goal is, within a series, that one may upgrade their OSG services via \nyum update\n cleanly and without any necessary\nconfig file changes or excessive downtime.\n\n\nOSG Release Series\n\n\nSince the start of the RPM-based OSG software stack, we have offered the following release series:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.5\n started August 2019.\n    The main differences between it and 3.4 were the introduction of the HTCondor 8.8 and 8.9 series;\n    also the RSV monitoring probes, EL6 support, and CREAM support were all dropped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.4\n started June 2017 and will reach its end-of-life in November 2020.\n    The main differences between it and 3.3 are the removal of edg-mkgridmap, GUMS, BeStMan, and VOMS Admin Server\n    packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.3\n started in August 2015 and was end-of-lifed in May 2018.\n    While the files have not been removed, it is strongly recommended that it not be installed anymore.\n    The main differences between 3.3 and 3.2 are the dropping of EL5 support, the addition of EL7 support, and the\n    dropping of Globus GRAM support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.2\n started in November 2013, and was end-of-lifed in August 2016.\n    The main differences between it and 3.1 were the introduction of glideinWMS 3.2, HTCondor 8.0, and Hadoop/HDFS 2.0;\n    also the gLite CE Monitor system was dropped in favor of osg-info-services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG 3.1\n started in April 2012, and was end-of-lifed in April 2015.\n    Historically, there were 3.0.x releases as well, but there was no separate release series for 3.0 and 3.1;\n    we simply went from 3.0.10 to 3.1.0 in the same repositories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG Upcoming\n\n\nThere is one more OSG Series called \"upcoming\" which contains major updates planned for a future release series.\nThe yum repositories for upcoming (\nosg-upcoming\n and \nosg-upcoming-testing\n) are available from all OSG 3.x series, and\nindividual packages can be installed from Upcoming without needing to update entirely to a new series.\nNote, however, that packages in the \"upcoming\" repositories are tested against the most recent OSG series.\nAs of the time of writing, \nosg-upcoming\n is meant to work with OSG 3.5.\n\n\nInstalling an OSG Release Series\n\n\nSee the \nyum repositories document\n for instructions on installing the OSG repositories.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to OSG 3.5\n\n\n\n\nOS Version Support\n\n\nOSG 3.5 only supports EL7\n\n\n\n\nIf you have an existing installation based on OSG release version \n= 3.4 (which will be referred to as the \nold series\n),\nand want to upgrade to 3.5 (the \nnew series\n), we recommend the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, remove the old series yum repositories:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm -e osg-release\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step ensures that any local modifications to \n*.repo\n files will not prevent installing the new series repos.\nAny modified \n*.repo\n files should appear under \n/etc/yum.repos.d/\n with the \n*.rpmsave\n extension.\nAfter installing the new OSG repositories (the next step) you may want to apply any changes made in the \n*.rpmsave\n\nfiles to the new \n*.repo\n files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the OSG repositories:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install https://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/3.5/osg-3.5-el7-release-latest.rpm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean yum cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that running \nyum update\n may also update other RPMs.\n    You can exclude packages from being updated using the \n--exclude=[package-name or glob]\n option for the\n    \nyum\n command.\n\n\nWatch the yum update carefully for any messages about a \n.rpmnew\n file being created.\n    That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed.\n    In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with\n    a \n.rpmnew\n extension.\n    You will need to merge any edits that have made into the \n.rpmnew\n file and then move the merged version\n    into place (that is, without the \n.rpmnew\n extension).\n    Watch especially for \n/etc/lcmaps.db\n, which every site is expected to edit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove any deprecated packages that were previously installed:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum remove osg-version \n\\\n\n                       osg-control \n\\\n\n                       \nrsv*\n \n\\\n\n                       glite-ce-cream-client-api-c \n\\\n\n                       glite-lbjp-common-gsoap-plugin \n\\\n\n                       xacml\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you did not have any of the above packages installed, Yum will not remove any packages:\n\n\nNo Match for argument: osg-version\nNo Match for argument: osg-control\nNo Match for argument: rsv*\nNo Match for argument: glite-ce-cream-client-api-c\nNo Match for argument: glite-lbjp-common-gsoap-plugin\nNo Match for argument: xacml\nNo Packages marked for removal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are updating an HTCondor-CE host, please consult the manual \nHTCondor\n and\n\nOSG Configure\n instructions below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning into issues?\n\n\nIf you are not having the expected result or having problems with Yum please see the\n\nYum troubleshooting guide\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to HTCondor-CE 4.x\n\n\nThe OSG 3.5 release series contains HTCondor-CE 4, a major version upgrade from the previously released versions in the OSG.\nSee the HTCondor-CE 4.0.0 \nrelease notes\n for an overview\nof the changes.\nIn particular, this version includes a major reorganization of the default configuration so updates will require manual\nintervention.\nTo update your HTCondor-CE host(s), perform the following steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate all CE packages:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update htcondor-ce \nosg-ce*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new default \ncondor_mapfile\n is sufficient since HTCondor-CE no longer relies on GSI authentication between\n   its daemons.\n   If \n/etc/condor-ce/condor_mapfile.rpmnew\n exists, replace your old \ncondor_mapfile\n with the \n.rpmnew\n version:\n\n\nroot@host #\n mv /etc/condor-ce/condor_mapfile.rpmnew /etc/condor-ce/condor_mapfile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerge any \n*.rpmnew\n files in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you may wish to make one or more of the following optional changes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE now disables batch system job retries by default.\n  To re-enable job retries, set the following configuration in \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nENABLE_JOB_RETRIES = True\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor non-HTCondor sites that use \nremote CE requirements\n,\n  the new version of HTCondor-CE accepts a simplified format.\n  For example, a snippet from an example job route in the old format:\n\n\nset_default_remote_cerequirements = strcat(\nWalltime == 3600 \n AccountingGroup ==\n, x509UserProxyFirstFQAN, \n\\\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nMay be rewritten as the following:\n\n\nset_WallTime = 3600;\nset_AccountingGroup = x509UserProxyFirstFQAN;\nset_default_CERequirements = \nWalltime,AccountingGroup\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReload and restart the HTCondor-CE daemons:\n\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl daemon-reload\n\nroot@host #\n systemctl restart condor-ce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to HTCondor 8.8.x\n\n\nThe OSG 3.5 release series contains HTCondor 8.8, a major version upgrade from the previously released versions in the OSG.\nSee the detailed \nupdate instructions below\n to update to HTCondor 8.8.\n\n\nUpdating to OSG Configure 3\n\n\nThe OSG 3.5 release series contains OSG-Configure 3, a major version upgrade from the previously released versions in the OSG.\nSee the OSG Configure release notes for an overview of the\n\nchanges\n.\nTo update OSG Configure on your HTCondor-CE, perform the following steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven't already, \nupdate to OSG 3.5\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have \nsite_name\n set in \n/etc/osg/config.d/40-siteinfo.ini\n, delete it and specify \nresource\n instead.\n   \nresource\n should match the resource name that's registered in\n   \nOSG Topology\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet \nresource_group\n in \n/etc/osg/config.d/40-siteinfo.ini\n to the resource group registered in\n    \nOSG Topology\n,\n    i.e. the name of the \n.yaml\n file in OSG Topology that contains the registered resouce above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet \nhost_name\n to the host name that is registered in \nOSG Topology\n.\n    This may be different from the FQDN of the host if you're using a DNS alias, for example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSG Configure will warn about config options that it does not recognize;\n    delete these options from the config to get rid of the warnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to HTCondor 8.9.7+\n\n\n\n\nWhere to find HTCondor 8.9\n\n\nThe HTCondor \ndevelopment series\n\nis available through the \nOSG upcoming\n repository.\n\n\n\n\nFor HTCondor hosts \n 8.9.7 using the SciTokens CredMon, updates to HTCondor 8.9.7+ require manual intervention and a\ncorresponding update to \npython2-scitokens-credmon\n, available in the OSG 3.5 release repository.\nIf you do not have the \npython2-scitokens-credmon\n package installed, you may skip these instructions.\nOtherwise, follow these steps for a seamless update to HTCondor 8.9.7+:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine if your HTCondor installation is configured to use the SciTokens CredMon:\n\n\n#\n condor_config_val -v DAEMON_LIST\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \nCREDD\n and \nSEC_CREDENTIAL_MONITOR\n are in the output of the above command, continue onto the next step.\nOtherwise, your installation is not configured to use SciTokens CredMon and you should skip the rest of these\ninstructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following to a file in \n/etc/condor/config.d/\n:\n\n\nSEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY_OAUTH = /var/lib/condor/oauth_credentials\nCREDMON_OAUTH = /usr/bin/condor_credmon_oauth\nSEC_CREDENTIAL_MONITOR_OAUTH_LOG = $(LOG)/CredMonOAuthLog\n\nif version \n 8.9.7\n  CREDMON_OAUTH = /usr/bin/scitokens_credmon\nendif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate your \nDAEMON_LIST\n configuration from:\n\n\nDAEMON_LIST = $(DAEMON_LIST), CREDD, SEC_CREDENTIAL_MONITOR\n\n\n\n\n\nto\n\n\nDAEMON_LIST = $(DAEMON_LIST), CREDD, CREDMON_OAUTH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn off the SchedD and CredMon daemons:\n\n\n#\n condor_off -daemon SCHEDD\n\n#\n condor_off -daemon SEC_CREDENTIAL_MONITOR\n\n#\n condor_off -daemon CREDMON_OAUTH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove the existing credential directory and set up a temporary symlink:\n\n\n# mv $(condor_config_val SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY) $(condor_config_val SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY_OAUTH)\n# ln -s $(condor_config_val SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY_OAUTH) $(condor_config_val SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate HTCondor and SciTokens CredMon packages:\n\n\n#\n yum -y upgrade python2-scitokens-credmon condor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are running Apache on this host, reload the Apache configuration:\n\n\n#\n systemctl reload httpd.service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReconfigure HTCondor:\n\n\n#\n condor_reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn the SchedD and CredMon daemons back on:\n\n\n#\n condor_on -daemon CREDMON_OAUTH\n\n#\n condor_on -daemon SCHEDD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean up old CredMon configuration.\n    Remove the following entries from your HTCondor configuration:\n\n\nSEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY = /var/lib/condor/credentials\nSEC_CREDENTIAL_MONITOR = /usr/bin/scitokens_credmon\nSEC_CREDENTIAL_MONITOR_LOG = $(LOG)/CredMonLog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo allow for seamless HTCondor downgrades, update the \nif version \n 8.9.7\n block that you added in step 2.\n\n\nif version \n 8.9.7\n  CREDMON_OAUTH = /usr/bin/scitokens_credmon\n  SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY = $(SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY_OAUTH)\nendif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the symlink to the old credential directory that you created in step 5.\n    This is whatever you had set \nSEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY\n to before.\n    For example:\n\n\n#\n rm /var/lib/condor/credentials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating to HTCondor 8.8.x\n\n\nThe OSG 3.5 and 3.4 release series contain HTCondor 8.8, a major version upgrade from the previously released versions\nin the OSG.\nSee the HTCondor 8.8 manual for an overview of the\n\nchanges\n.\nTo update HTCondor on your HTCondor-CE and/or HTCondor pool hosts, perform the following steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate all HTCondor packages:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update \ncondor*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor pools only:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nDAEMON_LIST\n, and \nCONDOR_HOST\n configuration changed in HTCondor 8.8.\n  Additionally in OSG 3.5, the default security was changed to use FS and pool password.\n  If you are experiencing issues with communication between hosts in your pool after the upgrade,\n  the default OSG configuration is listed in \n/etc/condor/config.d/00-osg_default_*.config\n:\n  ensure that any default configuration is overriden with your own \nDAEMON_LIST\n, \nCONDOR_HOST\n, and/or\n  \nsecurity\n configuration in subsequent files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of HTCondor 8.8, \nMOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH\n\n  has default values of \n/tmp\n and \n/var/tmp\n, which may cause issues if your\n  \nOSG_WN_TMP\n is a subdirectory of either of these directories.\n  If the partition containing your execute directories is \nlarge enough\n,\n  we recommend setting your \nOSG_WN_TMP\n to \n/tmp\n or \n/var/tmp\n.\n  If that partition is not large enough, we recommend setting your \nOSG_WN_TMP\n variable to a directory outside of\n  \n/tmp\n or \n/var/tmp\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-CE hosts only:\n The HTCondor 8.8 series changed the default job route matching order\n   \nfrom round-robin to first matching route\n.\n   To use the old round-robin matching order, add the following configuration to \n/etc/condor-ce/config.d/99-local.conf\n:\n\n\nJOB_ROUTER_ROUND_ROBIN_SELECTION = True\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean-up deprecated packages:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum remove \nrsv*\n glite-ce-cream-client-api-c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nYum repositories\n\n\nBasic use of Yum",

OSG uses RPMs (the Red Hat Packaging Manager) to package its software. While RPM is the packaging format, \nyum\n is the command you will use to do the installation. For example, \nyum\n will resolve and download the dependencies for the package you want to install; \nrpm\n will simply complain if you want to install a package that does not have all its dependencies installed.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nInstallation is done with the \nyum install\n command. Each of the individual installation guide shows you the correct command to use to do an installation. Here is an example installation with all of the output from yum.\n\n\nroot@host #\n sudo yum install osg-ca-certs\n\nLoaded plugins: kernel-module, priorities\n\n\nepel                                                                                         | 3.7 kB     00:00     \n\n\nepel/primary_db                                                                              | 3.8 MB     00:00     \n\n\nfermi-base                                                                                   | 2.1 kB     00:00     \n\n\nfermi-base/primary_db                                                                        |  48 kB     00:00     \n\n\nfermi-security                                                                               | 1.9 kB     00:00     \n\n\nfermi-security/primary_db                                                                    | 1.7 MB     00:00     \n\n\nosg                                                                                          | 1.9 kB     00:00     \n\n\nosg/primary_db                                                                               |  65 kB     00:00     \n\n\nsl-base                                                                                      | 2.1 kB     00:00     \n\n\nsl-base/primary_db                                                                           | 2.0 MB     00:00     \n\n\n957 packages excluded due to repository priority protections\n\n\nSetting up Install Process\n\n\nResolving Dependencies\n\n\n--\n Running transaction check\n\n\n---\n Package osg-ca-certs.noarch 0:1.23-1 set to be updated\n\n\n--\n Finished Dependency Resolution\n\n\nBeginning Kernel Module Plugin\n\n\nFinished Kernel Module Plugin\n\n\n\nDependencies Resolved\n\n\n\n====================================================================================================================\n\n\n Package                         Arch                      Version                     Repository              Size\n\n\n====================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstalling:\n\n\n osg-ca-certs                    noarch                    1.23-1                      osg                    450 k\n\n\n\nTransaction Summary\n\n\n====================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstall       1 Package(s)\n\n\nUpgrade       0 Package(s)\n\n\n\nTotal download size: 450 k\n\n\nIs this ok [y/N]: y\n\n\nDownloading Packages:\n\n\nosg-ca-certs-1.23-1.noarch.rpm                                                               | 450 kB     00:00     \n\n\nwarning: rpmts_HdrFromFdno: Header V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 824b8603\n\n\nosg/gpgkey                                                                                   | 1.7 kB     00:00     \n\n\nImporting GPG key 0x824B8603 \nOSG Software Team (RPM Signing Key for Koji Packages) \nvdt-support@opensciencegrid.org\n from /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-OSG\n\n\nIs this ok [y/N]: y\n\n\nRunning rpm_check_debug\n\n\nRunning Transaction Test\n\n\nFinished Transaction Test\n\n\nTransaction Test Succeeded\n\n\nRunning Transaction\n\n\n  Installing     : osg-ca-certs                                                                                 1/1 \n\n\n\nInstalled:\n\n\n  osg-ca-certs.noarch 0:1.23-1                                                                                      \n\n\n\nComplete!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease Note\n: When you first install a package from the OSG repository, you will be prompted to import the GPG key. We use this key to sign our RPMs as a security measure. You should double-check the key id (above it is 824B8603) with the \ninformation on our signed RPMs\n. If it doesn't match, there is a problem somewhere and you should report it to the OSG via help@opensciencegrid.org.\n\n\nVerifying Packages and Installations\n\n\nYou can check if an RPM has been modified. For instance, to check to see if any files have been modified in the \nosg-ca-certs\n RPM you just installed:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm --verify osg-ca-certs\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lack of any output means there were no problems. If you would like to see all the files for which there are no problems, you can do:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm --verify -v osg-ca-certs\n\n........    /etc/grid-security/certificates\n\n\n........    /etc/grid-security/certificates/0119347c.0\n\n\n........    /etc/grid-security/certificates/0119347c.namespaces\n\n\n........    /etc/grid-security/certificates/0119347c.signing_policy\n\n\n... etc ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach dot indicates a specific check that was made and passed. If someone had modified a file, you might see this:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm --verify osg-ca-certs\n\n..5....T    /etc/grid-security/certificates/ffc3d59b.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means the files MD5 checksum has changed (so the contents have changed) and the timestamp is different. The complete set of changes you might see (copied from the \nrpm\n man page) are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\nfile Size differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\nMode differs (includes permissions and file type)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nMD5 sum differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\nDevice major/minor number mismatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\nreadLink(2) path mismatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU\n\n\nUser ownership differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\nGroup ownership differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\nmTime differs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't care about some of those changes, you can tell rpm to ignore them. For instance, to ignore changes in the modification time:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm --verify --nomtime osg-ca-certs\n\n..5.....    /etc/grid-security/certificates/ffc3d59b.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding a package\n\n\nIf you want to know what package a file belongs to, you can ask rpm. For instance, if you're curious what package contains the \nsrm-ls\n command, you can do:\n\n\n#\n \n1\n. Find the exact path\n\nuser@host $\n which srm-ls\n\n/usr/bin/srm-ls\n\n\n\n#\n \n2\n. Ask rpm what package it is part of:\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -q --file /usr/bin/srm-ls\n\nbestman2-client-2.2.0-14.osg.el5.noarch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know what other things are in a package--perhaps the other available tools or configuration files--you can do that as well:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -ql bestman2-client\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc\n\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/bestman2.rc.samples\n\n\n/etc/bestman2/conf/srmclient.conf\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/bestman2\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-copy\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-copy-status\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-extendfilelifetime\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-ls\n\n\n/usr/bin/srm-ls-status\n\n\n... output trimmed ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat else does a package install?\n\n\nSometimes you need to understand what other software is installed by a package. This can be particularly useful for understanding \nmeta-packages\n, which are packages such as the \nosg-wn-client\n (worker node client) that contain nothing by themselves but only depend on other RPMs. To do this, use the \n--requires\n option to rpm. For example, you can see that the worker node client (as of OSG 3.1.8 in early September, 2012) will install \ncurl\n, \nuberftp\n, \nlcg-utils\n, and a dozen or so other packages.\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -q --requires osg-wn-client\n\n/usr/bin/curl  \n\n\n/usr/bin/dccp  \n\n\n/usr/bin/ldapsearch  \n\n\n/usr/bin/uberftp  \n\n\n/usr/bin/wget  \n\n\nbestman2-client  \n\n\nconfig(osg-wn-client) = 3.0.0-16.osg.el5\n\n\ndcache-srmclient  \n\n\ndcap-tunnel-gsi  \n\n\nedg-gridftp-client  \n\n\nfetch-crl  \n\n\nglite-fts-client  \n\n\nglobus-gass-copy-progs  \n\n\ngrid-certificates  \n\n\njava-1.6.0-sun-compat  \n\n\nlcg-utils  \n\n\nlfc-client  \n\n\nlfc-python  \n\n\nmyproxy  \n\n\nosg-system-profiler  \n\n\nosg-version  \n\n\nrpmlib(CompressedFileNames) \n= 3.0.4-1\n\n\nrpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) \n= 4.0-1\n\n\nvo-client\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding RPM Packages\n\n\nIt is normally best to read the OSG documentation to decide which packages to install because it may not be obvious what the correct packages to install are. That said, you can use yum to find out all sort of things. For instance, you can list packages that begin with \"voms\":\n\n\nuser@host $\n yum list \nvoms*\n\n\nLoaded plugins: kernel-module, priorities\n\n\n957 packages excluded due to repository priority protections\n\n\nAvailable Packages\n\n\nvoms.i386                                                    2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms.x86_64                                                  2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-admin-client.x86_64                                     2.0.16-1                                           osg \n\n\nvoms-admin-server.noarch                                     2.6.1-9                                            osg \n\n\nvoms-clients.x86_64                                          2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-compat.i386                                             1.9.19.2-6.osg                                     osg \n\n\nvoms-compat.x86_64                                           1.9.19.2-6.osg                                     osg \n\n\nvoms-devel.i386                                              2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-devel.x86_64                                            2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-doc.x86_64                                              2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvoms-mysql-plugin.x86_64                                     3.1.5.1-1.el5                                      epel\n\n\nvoms-server.x86_64                                           2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvomsjapi.x86_64                                              2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg \n\n\nvomsjapi-javadoc.x86_64                                      2.0.6-3.osg                                        osg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to search for packages that contain VOMS anywhere in the name or description, you can use \nyum search\n:\n\n\nuser@host $\n yum search voms\n\nLoaded plugins: kernel-module, priorities\n\n\n957 packages excluded due to repository priority protections\n\n\n================================================== Matched: voms ===================================================\n\n\nosg-voms.noarch : OSG VOMS\n\n\nperl-VOMS-Lite.noarch : Perl extension for VOMS Attribute certificate creation\n\n\nperl-voms-server.noarch : Perl extension for VOMS Attribute certificate creation\n\n\nphp-voms-admin.noarch : Web based interface to control VOMS parameters written in PHP\n\n\nvoms.i386 : Virtual Organization Membership Service\n\n\nvoms.x86_64 : Virtual Organization Membership Service\n\n\n... etc ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne last example, if you want to know what RPM would give you the \nvoms-proxy-init\n command, you can ask \nyum\n.

Not only will it uninstall the RPM you requested, but it will uninstall anything that depends on it. For example, if I previously installed the \nvoms-clients\n package, I also installed another package it depends on called \nvoms\n.

repository and \nno other\n repositories, you can tell yum to do that with the following command:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum --disablerepo\n=\n* --enablerepo\n=\nosg update\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced topic: Getting debugging information for installed software\n\n\nIf you run into a problem with our software and have a hankering to debug it directly (or perhaps we need to ask you for some help), you can install so-called \"debuginfo\" packages. These packages will provide debugging symbols and source code so that you can do things like run \ngdb\n or \npstack\n to get information about a program.\n\n\nInstalling the debuginfo package requires three steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the installation of debuginfo packages. This only needs to be done once. Edit the yum repo file, usually \n/etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo\n to enable the separate debuginfo repository. Near the bottom of the file, you'll see the \nosg-debug\n repo: \n\n\n[osg-debug]\n\nname=OSG Software for Enterprise Linux 5 - $basearch - Debug\nbaseurl=http://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg-release/$basearch/debu\nfailovermethod=priority \npriority=98 \nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1 \ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-OSG\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that \"enabled\" is set to 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure out which package installed the program you want to debug. One way to figure it out is to ask RPM. For example, if you want to debug grid-proxy-init:\n\n\nuser@host $\n rpm -qf \n`\nwhich grid-proxy-init\n`\n\n\nglobus-proxy-utils-5.0-5.osg.x86_64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the debugging information for that package. Continuing this example: \n\n\nroot@host #\n debuginfo-install globus-proxy-utils\n\n...\n\n\n=================================================================================================================================\n\n\n Package                                      Arch                   Version                     Repository                 Size\n\n\n=================================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstalling:\n\n\n globus-proxy-utils-debuginfo                 x86_64                 5.0-5.osg                   osg-debug                  61 k\n\n\n\nTransaction Summary\n\n\n=================================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstall       1 Package(s)\n\n\nUpgrade       0 Package(s)\n\n\n\nTotal download size: 61 k\n\n\nIs this ok [y/N]: y\n\n\n...\n\n\nInstalled:\n\n\n  globus-proxy-utils-debuginfo.x86_64 0:5.0-5.osg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last step will select the right package name, then use \nyum\n to install it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nYum not finding packages\n\n\nIf you is not finding some packages, e.g.:\n\n\nError Downloading Packages:\n  packageXYZ: failure: packageXYZ.rpm from osg: [Errno 256] No more mirrors to try.\n\n\n\n\n\nthen you can try cleaning up Yum's cache:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n*\n\n\n\n\n\nYum complaining about missing keys\n\n\nIf yum is complaining you can re-import the keys in your distribution:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY*\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nThe main Yum web site\n\n\nA good description of the commands for RPM and Yum can be found at \nLearn Linux 101: RPM and Yum Package Management\n.",

Installing the debuginfo package requires three steps.    Enable the installation of debuginfo packages. This only needs to be done once. Edit the yum repo file, usually  /etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo  to enable the separate debuginfo repository.

            "text": "Installing, Configuring, Using, and Troubleshooting RSV\n\n\nAbout This Guide\n\n\nThe Resource and Service Validation (RSV) software helps a site administrator verify that certain site resources and services are working as expected. OSG recommends that sites install and run RSV, but it is optional; further, each site selects which specific tests (called \nprobes\n) to run.\n\n\nUse this page to learn more about RSV in general, and how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot RSV from the OSG software repositories. For documentation on specific probes or on how to write your own probes, please check the \nReference section\n.\n\n\nIntroduction to RSV\n\n\nThe Resource and Service Validation (RSV) software provides OSG site administrators a scalable and easy-to-maintain\nresource and service monitoring infrastructure.\nIt consists of client tools that allow a site administrator to run tests against their site by providing a set of tests\n(which can run on the same or other hosts within a site), HTCondor-Cron for scheduling, and tools for collecting and\nstoring the results (using Gratia).\nThe client package is not installed by default and may be installed on a CE or other host.\nGenerally, you configure the RSV client to run tests at scheduled time intervals and then it makes results available on\na local website. Also, the client can upload test results to a central collector (see next item).\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nUser IDs:\n If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user IDs \nrsv\n and \ncndrcron\n\n\nService certificate:\n The RSV service requires a service certificate (\n/etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvcert.pem\n) and matching key (\n/etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvkey.pem\n)\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n To view results, port 80 must accept incoming requests; outbound connectivity to tested services must work, too\n\n\nHost choice:\n Install RSV on your site CE unless you have specific reasons (e.g., performance) for installing on a separate host\n\n\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the RSV host has \na supported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare \nthe required Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling RSV\n\n\nAn installation of RSV at a site consists of the RSV client software, the Apache web server, parts of HTCondor (for its cron-like scheduling capabilities), and various other small tools. To simplify installation, OSG provides a convenience RPM that installs all required software with a single command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider updating your local cache of Yum repository data and your existing RPM packages:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum clean all --enablerepo\n=\n\\*\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \nupdate\n command will update \nall\n packages on your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have installed HTCondor already but not by RPM, install a special empty RPM to make RSV happy:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install empty-condor --enablerepo\n=\nosg-empty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall RSV and related software:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install rsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring RSV\n\n\nAfter installation, there are some one-time configuration steps to tell RSV how to operate at your site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and follow the instructions in the file. There are detailed comments for each setting. In the simplest case \u2014 to monitor only your CE \u2014 set the \nhtcondor_ce_hosts\n variable to the fully qualified hostname of your CE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have installed HTCondor already but not by RPM, specify the location of the Condor installation in \n30-rsv.ini\n in the \ncondor_location\n setting. If an HTCondor RPM is installed, you do not need to set \ncondor_location\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete the configuration using the \nosg-configure\n tool:\n\n\nroot@host #\n osg-configure -v\n\nroot@host #\n osg-configure -c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional configuration\n\n\nThe following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be required for setting up a small or typical site. If you do not need any of the following special configurations, skip to \nthe section on using RSV\n.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, read the \nConfigureRsv\n page for more advanced configuration options.\n\n\nConfiguring RSV to run probes using a remote server\n\n\nRSV monitors systems by running probes, which can run on the RSV host itself (the default case), via a separate batch system like HTCondor, or via a remote batch system using a Globus gatekeeper and its job manager. The last two options both can count those jobs and report them to, for example, Gratia.\n\n\nIn this case, remember to:\n\n\n\n\nAdd the RSV user \nrsv\n on all the systems where the probes may run, and\n\n\nMap the RSV service certificate to the user you intend to use for RSV. This should be a local user used exclusively for RSV and not belonging to an institutional VO to avoid for the RSV probes to be accounted as regular VO jobs in Gratia. \nThis can be done in the configuration of the \nLCMAPS VOMS plugin\n on your CE.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the RSV web server to use HTTPS instead of HTTP\n\n\nIf you would like your local RSV web server to use HTTPS instead of the default HTTP (for compatibility or security reasons), complete the steps below. This procedure assumes that you already have an HTTP service certificate (or a copy of the host certificate) in \n/etc/grid-security/http/\n. If not, omit the \nSSLCertificate*\n modifications below, and your web server will start with its own, self-signed certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nmod_ssl\n:\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install mod_ssl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake an alternate set of HTTP service certificate files:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cp -p /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert2.pem\n\nroot@host #\n cp -p /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey2.pem\n\nroot@host #\n chown apache:apache /etc/grid-security/http/http*2.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack up existing Apache configuration files:\n\n\nroot@host #\n cp -p /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.orig\n\nroot@host #\n cp -p /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf.orig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the default port for HTTP connections to 8000 by editing \n/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf\n\n\nListen 8000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up HTTPS access by editing \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf\n:\n\n\nListen 8443\n\nVirtualHost _default_:8443\n\nSSLCertificateFile /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert2.pem\nSSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey2.pem\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter these changes, when you start the Apache service, it will listening on ports \n8000\n (for HTTP) and \n8443\n (for HTTPS), rather than the default port \n80\n (for HTTP only).\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nif you make the changes above, you must restart the Apache server after each CA certificate update to pick up the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing RSV\n\n\nManaging RSV and associated services\n\n\nIn addition to the RSV service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation. The specific services are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nService name\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch CRL\n\n\nfetch-crl-boot\n and \nfetch-crl-cron\n\n\nSee \nCA documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApache\n\n\nhttpd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor-Cron\n\n\ncondor-cron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSV\n\n\nrsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the services in the order listed and stop them in reverse order. As a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as \nroot\n):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \u2026\n\n\nRun the command \u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a service\n\n\nservice \nSERVICE-NAME\n start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop a service\n\n\nservice \nSERVICE-NAME\n stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable a service to start during boot\n\n\nchkconfig \nSERVICE-NAME\n on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable a service from starting during boot\n\n\nchkconfig \nSERVICE-NAME\n off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nSERVICE-NAME\n is the name of the service on the table above.\n\n\nRunning RSV manually\n\n\nNormally, the HTCondor-Cron scheduler runs RSV periodically. However, you can run RSV probes manually at any time:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rsv-control --run --all-enabled\n\n\n\n\n\nIf successful, results will be available from your local RSV web server (e.g., \nhttp://localhost/rsv\n) and, if enabled (which is the default) on \nMyOSG\n.\n\n\nYou can also run the metrics individually or pass special parameters as explained in the \nrsv-control document\n.\n\n\nTroubleshooting RSV\n\n\nTo get assistance, use the \nhelp procedure\n.\n\n\nRSV has a tool to collect information useful for troubleshooting into a tarball that can be shared with the developers and support staff.\nTo use it:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --profile\n\nRunning the rsv-profiler...\n\n\nOSG-RSV Profiler\n\n\nAnalyzing...\n\n\nMaking tarball (rsv-profiler.tar.gz)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find more information on troubleshooting RSV in the \nrsv-control documentation\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are getting assistance via the trouble ticket system, you must add a \n.txt\n extension to the tarball so it can be uploaded:\n\n\n\n\nFailed to send via Gratia\n\n\nIf you see \nFailed to send record Failed to send via Gratia: Server unable to receive data:\n in \n/var/log/rsv/consumers/gratia-consumer.output\n you should process to disable the gratia consumer using the following commands\n\n\nroot@host#\n  rsv-control --disable --host \nYOUR RSV HOST\n gratia-consumer\n\nroot@host#\n  rsv-control --off --host \nYOUR RSV HOST\n gratia-consumer\n\n\n\n\n\nChange \nYOUR RSV HOST\n for the hostname of the server where you are installing RSV.\n\n\nImportant file locations\n\n\nLogs and configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric log files\n\n\n/var/log/rsv/metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer log files\n\n\n/var/log/rsv/consumers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML files\n\n\n/usr/share/rsv/www/\n\n\nAvailable at \nhttp://your.host.example.com/rsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial configuration\n\n\n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n\n\nRead by \nosg-configure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSV configuration\n\n\n/etc/rsv\n\n\nGenerally files in this directory should not be edited directly.

This document provides instructions for configuration beyond what osg-configure is able to do.\n\n\nConfiguring metrics\n\n\nIf you need to change the behavior of a metric you can edit the metric configuration files. These replace the spec files from previous versions of RSV.\n\n\n\n\n/etc/rsv/metrics\n - changes made to conf file in this directory named after a metric will affect the metric when run against all hosts\n\n\n/etc/rsv/metrics/\nHOST\n - changes made to conf files in this directory (named as the host FQDN) will affect the metric when run against the specific host\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration files are in INI format and have two sections:\n\n\n\n\na first one named after the metric with execution options\n\n\na second one with the name including the \"args\" keyword, including parameters sent to the probe at invokation\n\n\n\n\nChanging the times a metric runs\n\n\nTo change the time a metric runs set the \ncron-interval\n setting in the metric's conf file. Use \nman 5 crontab\n for a description of the format. For example, to change the \norg.osg.general.ping-host\n to run at a different time:\n\n\n[org.osg.general.ping-host]\n\n\ncron-interval\n \n=\n \n45 * * * *\n\n\n\n[org.osg.general.ping-host args]\n\n\n#ping-count =\n\n\n#ping-timeout =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBe sure to put the \ncron-interval\n setting in the \n[org.osg.general.ping-host]\n section, and not the \n[org.osg.general.ping-host args]\n section! The purpose of the \"args\" section is described in the \"passing extra parameters to a metric\" section below.\n\n\n\n\nAfter modifying the cron time of a metric you must restart RSV for the change to take effect.\n\n\nTo see what times each of the metrics is running you can use \nrsv-control\n as follows:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control -l --cron-times\n\n\nMetrics enabled for host: osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu:10443 | Cron times\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------+--------------------\n\n\norg.osg.srm.srmcp-readwrite                         | 28 * * * *\n\n\norg.osg.srm.srmping                                 | 13,33,53 * * * *\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing extra parameters to a metric\n\n\nAny \nkey=value\n pairs in the \"args\" section of the metric's \nconf\n file will be turned into command line parameters to the probe. For example, for this file:\n\n\n[org.osg.certificates.cacert-expiry args]\n\n\nwarning-hours\n \n=\n \n6\n\n\nerror-hours\n \n=\n \n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would lead to the probe getting called with the command-line parameters \n--warning-hours 6 --error-hours 12\n.\n\n\nConfigure consumers\n\n\nThere is a configuration file common to all consumers: \n/etc/rsv/consumers.conf\n. It is a file in INI format and possible entries are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nValues\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenabled\n\n\nconsumers\n\n\nComma-separated list of consumers to be enabled\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\n\n\nlocal\n\n\nIf this is set to local, a record with a local timestamp will be supplied to the consumer. If this is set to any other value, or is not set, a record with the GMT will be created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach consumer has a configuration file in \n/etc/rsv/consumers\n named after it. This allows to specify command lines and environment for the consumers. Some consumers may have also their own configuration file, usually in \n/etc/rsv/\n. Below is an example for the Nagios consumer.\n\n\nSending RSV records to Nagios\n\n\n\n\nEdit your \n/etc/rsv/rsv-nagios.conf\n file and fill in the appropriate information. The path of the configuration file is specified in \n/etc/rsv/consumers/nagios-consumer.conf\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf your Nagios config file contains password information you will want to lock down the permissions. Here is a suggested way to do this (replace \nRSVUSER\n with the group of your RSV user (\nrsvuser\n by default)):\n\n\nroot@host#\n chown root:\nRSVUSER\n /etc/rsv/rsv-nagios.conf\n\nroot@host#\n chmod \n0440\n /etc/rsv/rsv-nagios.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the configuration file at \n/etc/rsv/consumers/nagios-consumer.conf\n, check the following two settings:\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the path to your config file is correct. It may be referencing a directory \nconfig\n instead of \netc\n\n\nIf you want to use \nrsv2nsca\n add the string \"--send-nsca\" to the \nargs\n line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable and start the Nagios consumer by editing \nconsumers.conf\n or by using \nrsv-control\n as follows:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --enable nagios-consumer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nagios consumer will be started the next time that you start RSV. If you are already running RSV you can turn on the Nagios consumer immediately by running:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --on nagios-consumer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo verify that the Nagios consumer is running you can run \nrsv-control -j\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe log information for the Nagios consumer can be found in these files:\n\n\n/var/log/rsv/consumers/nagios-consumer.log\n\n\n/var/log/rsv/consumers/nagios-consumer.out\n\n\n/var/log/rsv/consumers/nagios-consumer.err\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral RSV configuration options\n\n\nYou can configure the RSV framework using \n/etc/rsv/rsv.conf\n.

It details the usage of the \nrsv-control\n command for enabling, disabling, testing and running RSV probes.\n\n\nrsv-control\n provides an interface to many RSV tasks. \nrsv-control\n can view RSV jobs, run metrics, enable or disable metrics and consumers, and allow advanced configuration.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nrsv-control\n can be used to configure RSV as described here and in \nthe advanced configuration document\n. Most site admins will be able to configure RSV by editing \n/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini\n and running \nosg-configure\n as described in the \ninstallation doc\n.\n\n\n\n\nUsing \nrsv-control\n to configure is for advanced RSV use including enabling non-default metrics. Admins who don't use \nrsv-control\n for configuration can still use it to view their RSV jobs, run RSV tests, and help debug RSV problems. Anyone can view the jobs, but you must be root or the RSV user (\nrsv\n by default) to execute other commands, e.g. run, enable and disable probes, or to turn RSV on and off.\n\n\nViewing RSV jobs\n\n\nrsv-control provides two different views: viewing the \ndesired\n state and viewing the current \nactual\n state.\n\n\n\n\nDesired = what metrics and consumers will start the next time RSV is started\n\n\nActual = what metrics and consumers are currently running\n\n\n\n\nDesired state\n\n\nTo view the desired state, use the \n--list\n (\n-l\n for short) flag.

Note that \"enable\" and \"disable\" are desired states (this is similar to \nosg-control\n). After enabling a metric you should turn it on if you want it to be running immediately. After disabling a metric that is running, you should still turn it off (a message will print after each of these actions to remind you of this behavior).\n\n\nEnabling\n\n\nThe syntax for enabling metrics looks similar to the syntax for running metrics:\n\n\nrsv-control --enable --host \nHOST\n \nMETRIC\n [ \nMETRIC2\n ...]\n\n\nYou must provide a host to enable the metric against (in order to enable a metric on multiple hosts you must run \nrsv-control\n once per host).\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --enable \n\\\n\n    --host osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu org.osg.gip.consistency\n\nEnabling metric \norg.osg.gip.consistency\n for host \nosg-edu.cs.wisc.edu\n\n\n\nOne or more metrics have been enabled and will be started the next time RSV is started.

Use the \n--verbose\n (\n-v\n) flag. This flag can be used with any of rsv-control's abilities (run, enable, list, etc). The verbosity levels are:\n\n\n\n\n0 = print nothing\n\n\n1 = print warnings and errors along with usual output of command being run (1 is the default level)\n\n\n2 = adds informational messages\n\n\n3 = full debugging output\n\n\n\n\nUsing the RSV verify tool\n\n\nThe \n--verify\n flag will run some basic checks for your RSV installation:\n\n\nroot@host#\n rsv-control --verify\n\nTesting if Condor-Cron is running...\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\nTesting if metrics are running...\n\n\nOK (98 running metrics)\n\n\n\nTesting if consumers are running...\n\n\nOK (1 running consumers)\n\n\n\nChecking which consumers are configured...\n\n\nThe following consumers are enabled: html-consumer\n\n\nWARNING: The gratia-consumer is not enabled.

Warning  rsv-control  can be used to configure RSV as described here and in  the advanced configuration document . Most site admins will be able to configure RSV by editing  /etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini  and running  osg-configure  as described in the  installation doc .   Using  rsv-control  to configure is for advanced RSV use including enabling non-default metrics. Admins who don't use  rsv-control  for configuration can still use it to view their RSV jobs, run RSV tests, and help debug RSV problems. Anyone can view the jobs, but you must be root or the RSV user ( rsv  by default) to execute other commands, e.g. run, enable and disable probes, or to turn RSV on and off.",

It is particularly useful when setting up a VO for the first time or when changing the sites at which a VO\u2019s jobs can run. For a site to pass the test, it must successfully run a simple test job via the normal GlideinWMS mechanisms, in much the same way as a real VO job.\n\n\nUse this page to learn how to install, configure, and use the Tester for your VO front-end.\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\n\n\nSoftware:\n You must have \na GlideinWMS Front-end\n installed\n\n\nConfiguration:\n The GlideinWMS Front-end must be configured (a) \nto have at least one group that matches pilots to sites using DESIRED_SITES\n, and (b) \nto support the is_itb user job attribute\n\n\nHost choice:\n The Tester should be installed on its own host; a small Virtual Machine (VM) is ideal\n\n\nService certificate:\n The Tester requires a host certificate at \n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n and an accompanying key at \n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\nNetwork ports:\n Test jobs must be able to contact the tester using the HTCondor Shared Port on port 9615 (TCP), and you must be able to contact a web server on port 80 (TCP) to view test results.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the Tester\n\n\nThe Tester software takes advantage of several other OSG software components, so the installation will also include OSG\u2019s site validation system (RSV), HTCondor, and the GlideinWMS pilot submission software.\n\n\nroot@host #\n yum install rsv-gwms-tester\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Tester\n\n\nBefore you use the Tester, there are some one-time configuration steps to complete, one set on your GlideinWMS Front-end Central Manager host and one set on the Tester host.\n\n\nConfiguring the GlideinWMS Front-end Central Manager\n\n\nComplete these steps \non your GlideinWMS Front-end Central Manager host\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorize the Tester host to connect to your Central Manager:\n\n\nroot@host #\n glidecondor_addDN -allow-others -daemon \nCOMMENT\n \nTESTER_DN\n condor\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nCOMMENT\n is a human-readable label for the Tester host (e.g., \u201cRSV GWMS Tester at myhost\u201d), and \nTESTER_DN\n is the Distinguished Name (DN) of the host certificate of your Tester host.

There may be transient failures but if you notice a site in the failed state over multiple days, contact OSG Factory Operations (\n) about the failing site, including a link to your Tester RSV results page.\n\n\nTo see detailed information from each probe, click on the probe name in the Metric column.\n\n\nTo see the list of sites that are supported by your VO(s) and are being tested, click the \u201corg.osg.local-gfactory-site-querying-local\u201d link at the bottom of the list of probes. You can also run the probe manually, as described next.\n\n\nListing supported sites manually\n\n\nTo manually run the probe that fetches the list of sites supported by your VO(s), run the following command on your Tester host:\n\n\nroot@host #\n rsv-control --run org.osg.local-gfactory-site-querying-local --host localhost\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probe produces many lines of output, some of which are just about the probe execution itself. But look for lines like this:\n\n\nMSG: Updating configuration for host \nSITE_NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nSITE_NAME\n is the name of the site, and there should be one such line per site supported by your VO(s).\n\n\nTroubleshooting RSV-GWMS-Tester\n\n\nYou can find more information on troubleshooting in the \nRSV troubleshooting section\n\n\nLogs and configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondor Cron log files\n\n\n/var/log/condor-cron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Description\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric configuration\n\n\n/etc/rsv/metrics/org.osg.local-gfactory-site-querying-local.conf\n\n\nTo change arguments and environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nTo get assistance, please use the \nthis page\n.\n\n\nReference\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\n\nUser that owns certificate\n\n\nPath to certificate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost certificate\n\n\nroot\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost key\n\n\nroot\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind instructions to request a host certificate \nhere\n.",
