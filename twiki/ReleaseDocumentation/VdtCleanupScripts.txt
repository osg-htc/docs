%ICON{"hand"}% This Document is for System Administrators. It introduces the usage of cleanup scripts provided by the %LINK_VDT% to perform maintenance on a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%.

---+ About the Cleanup Procedure

The cleanup script located at =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/cleanup-scripts/vdt-cleanup= is run by the =cron= daemon on the user's behalf and cleans up following files and directories:

   * Globus TMP directory: =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/tmp=
   * user gass cache =&lt;user home&gt;/.globus/.gass_cache=
   * user Globus job directory =&lt;user home&gt;/.globus/job=
   * user GRAM job manager logs =&lt;user home&gt;/gram_job_mgr_&lt;integer&gt;.log=
   * user GRAM scratch directories =&lt;user home&gt;/gram_scratch_&lt;random string&gt;=

---+ Installation

The cleanup scripts are installed as part of the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall][Compute Element Installation]].

%NOTE% If you are updating a CE from a version of OSG prior to 1.2.20 you will need to _add_ the following lines to your main configuration file =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini=.

<pre class="file">
; As of OSG 1.2.20 cleanup scripts are included to help delete old files                             
; For more information see the Twiki:                                                                
;   https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/VdtCleanupScripts                        
enable_cleanup = %(enable)s

; The age in days after with files, that have not been accessed, should be deleted.                  
; Jobs that run longer than this number of days may be killed because necessary                      
; files in VDT_LOCATION/globus/tmp may be removed.  If this is a problem for you                     
; do not run the vdt-cleanup script and email vdt-support@opensciencegrid.org   
; Default = 14                    
cleanup_age_in_days = 14

; The user's home directories that should be cleaned up.  The default value                          
; is @vo-file.  This will open osg-user-vo-map.txt and try to get the list                           
; of users from this file.  Alternatively you can specify a whitespace separated                     
; list of users.                                                                                     
cleanup_users_list = @vo-file

; The cron time at which the cleanup script will run.  By default it will run                        
; once a day during the night.                                                                       
cleanup_cron_time = 15 1 * * *
</pre>

%IMPORTANT% If you set the age to 14 days, jobs that run for longer than 14 days may be killed because necessary files are cleaned up from the =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/tmp= directory.  You should set this value to a number of days higher than you expect your long running jobs to take to complete.  If this is a problem for you then do not use the =vdt-cleanup= script.

%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices" section="Activate" INPUT_SCREEN="rootscreen" TOC_SHIFT=""}%

---+ Advanced Topic: Adding Custom Cleanup Scripts

The cron job automatically executes all scripts found in =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/cleanup-scripts= directory that are:

   * owned by _root_
   * permissions set to _0700_

Following environment variables will be present during the execution of the scripts:

| *Variable* | *Comment* |
| $VDT_LOCATION | Location of the VDT installation. |
| $VDT_CLEANUP_AGE | Age in days after which files will be deleted. |
| $VDT_CLEANUP_USER_FILE | Path to a file containing a list of user accounts and home directories to clean up.  The format is: &lt;user&gt; &lt;user home&gt; |

---+ Validation of Service Operation

   1 Verify that the log file =$VDT_LOCATION/logs/vdt-cleanup.log= has been created and inspect its content
   1 Run the cleanup script =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/cleanup-scripts/vdt-cleanup= with the =--dry-run= option and inspect the output<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/cleanup-scripts/vdt-cleanup --dry-run</pre>

---+ Known Issues

Currently none.
