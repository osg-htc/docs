---++ General 
I conducted the tests on several persistent and test ITB site. The test were simple jobs using both Globus (pre-ws and ws) and Condor-G interface along with simple stagein. We also conducted storage validation to test space reservation.

---++ Process
   * Compute Elements Tests
      * Tests were successful on FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB, BNL_ITB_Test1, LBNL_DSD_ITB, and CIGI-ITB.
   * Storage Tests 
      * I was successfully able to test opportunistic storage on both d-cache (FNAL and BNL) and Bestman (LBNL). 
      * UC-ITB is still having authentication issues
      * During the testing I discovered couple of bugs:
         1. fermi srm client tools do not work with BestMan storage. This bug has been fixed in the new VDT release.
         1. When using the lbnl client tool, I was not able to reserve 5GB space.On further investigation I found a bug in the srm-client-lbnl. The maximum size reservation one can make is limited to 2147483647 (2^31-1). This was because a client is using a 4 byte signed int for size that overflows at 2^31 causing the problem. Alex confirmed the problem and has developed the fix that will be included in the next VDT release 

---++ Status 
   * We can consider the validation successful
