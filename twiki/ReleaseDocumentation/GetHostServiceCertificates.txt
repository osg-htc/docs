%ICON{hand}% This document is for system administrators. After reading this document you should be able to apply for and install a grid certificate on a grid resource. This document does not explain how to apply for a grid user certificate. To apply for a grid user certificate click [[UserCertificate][here]] instead!

---+ Requirements

Before requesting a %RED%new%ENDCOLOR% host or service certificate, you should check if a certificate is not installed already using *openssl*. In this case you may safely skip this document:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% ~]$ openssl x509 -in %RED%/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem%ENDCOLOR% -subject -issuer -dates -noout
subject= /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=%UCL_HOST_FQDN%
issuer= /DC=org/DC=DOEGrids/OU=Certificate Authorities/CN=DOEGrids CA 1
notBefore=Jan  4 21:08:09 2010 GMT
notAfter=Jan  4 21:08:09 2011 GMT
</pre>

We recommend to read background information on grid certificates which can be found [[Documentation.CertificateWhatIs][here]]. In order to proceed you will also need:

   * a [[PacmanInstall][Pacman]] installation
   * the *fully qualified domain name* of the host you need a grid certificate for
   * the *purpose* of the certificate that explains your request to the Certificate Authority
   * the full *name of the administrator* responsible for the host
   * the *e-mail address of the administrator*
   * the *telephone number of the administrator*
   * the name of the *Certificate Authority* your project is affiliated with
   * the name of the *Virtual Organization* affiliated with the Certificate Authority

%STARTSECTION{"InstallCertificateScriptsPackage"}%
---+%SHIFT% Install the Certificate Scripts Package (Optional)

The Certificate Scripts Package is distributed by the %LINK_VDT% and is installed on every %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%, %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE% and comes with every  [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][OSG Client]]. By looking for the =vdt-ca-manage= program you can check if the package is already installed:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% ~]$ cd $VDT_LOCATION
%UCL_PROMPT% . $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
%UCL_PROMPT% which vdt-ca-manage
%UCL_CWD%/vdt/bin/vdt-ca-manage
</pre>

%NOTE% You may safely skip the next step if the program =vdt-ca-manage= has been found!

%LINK_PACMAN% is used to install the Certificate Scripts Package from the %LINK_VDT%. First create a new directory where the Certificate Scripts Package will be installed and change to it:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% ~]$ mkdir %UCL_CWD%
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% ~]$ cd %UCL_CWD%
</pre>

Next use Pacman to install the Certificate Scripts Package:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% pacman -get %VDT_CACHE_URL%:PPDG-Cert-Scripts
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% pacman -get %VDT_CACHE_URL%:PPDG-Cert-Scripts

Do you want to add [%VDT_CACHE_URL%] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): %RED%yall%ENDCOLOR%
Beginning VDT prerequisite checking script vdt-common/vdt-prereq-check... 

The VDT installs a variety of software, each with its own license.
In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
You can view the licenses online at:

    http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/

After the installation has completed, you will also be able to
view the licenses in the "licenses" directory.

Do you agree to the licenses? [y/n]
%RED%y%ENDCOLOR%
All prerequisite checks are satisfied.
                                                        
========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.

</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

In case you have never used Pacman before, you will be asked to agree to its license. If you also agreed to add =%VDT_CACHE_URL%= to the list of trusted caches, you should see the directory =%UCL_CWD%= populated. Finally update the environment for the changes to take effect:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% source setup.sh
</pre>

For *c/tc shell* change setup.sh to %RED%setup.csh%ENDCOLOR%.

%ENDSECTION{"InstallCertificateScriptsPackage"}%

---+ Setup Initial Certificate Authority (CA) Package

Next we will use the =vdt-ca-manage= program to install the initial set of certificate authorities:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% vdt-ca-manage setupCA --location %RED%local%ENDCOLOR% --url %RED%osg%ENDCOLOR%

Setting CA Certificates for VDT installation at '%UCL_CWD%'
Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

This command is used for the initial setup of the CA package. The option =--location local= is used to define a location below your current directory (=%UCL_CWD%/globus/share/certificates=). Alternatively you can use =--location root= to install the certificates into their standard location (/etc/grid-security/certificates).

---+ Request a Host Certificate

Every resource or service contributing to the grid needs a certificate issued by one of the trusted *Certificate Authorities*. To proceed you will need following information at hand:

   * the *fully qualified domain* name of the host you need a grid certificate for
   * the *purpose* of the certificate that explains your request to the Certificate Authority
   * the full *name of the administrator* responsible for the host
   * the *e-mail address of the administrator*
   * the *telephone number of the administrator*
   * the name of the *Certificate Authority* your project is affiliated with
   * the name of the *Virtual Organization* affiliated with the Certificate Authority

Next we will use *cert-request* to generate a request which will be sent to the Certificate Authority you specified:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% cert-request -ou s -dir . -label %UCL_HOST_FQDN%
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
<pre class="screen">

</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

At this point *cert-request* has created some files in the directory you specified and an e-mail has been sent to the Certificate Authority containing your request. The files will be needed again once you receive a reply from the Certificate Authority asking you to retrieve the certificate.

---++ Retrieve and Install the Host Certificate

Once the certificate has been approved by the Certificate Authority you will receive an e-mail which includes the *serial number* in the format *0xYYYY*. The serial number will be needed to retrieve the certificate. 

To retrieve the host certificate change to the installation directory of the Certificate Scripts Package and update your environment:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% ~]$ cd %UCL_CWD%
%UCL_PROMPT% source setup.sh 
</pre>

For *c/tc shell* change setup.sh to %RED%setup.csh%ENDCOLOR%. Next we will use the %RED%serial number%ENDCOLOR% of the certificate and the previous values for =-label= and =-dir= to retrieve the certificate executing *cert-retrieve*:

<pre class="screen">

</pre>

The certificate consists of two files (%UCL_HOST_FQDN%cert.pem and %UCL_HOST_FQDN%key.pem) which have been placed into the current directory. Note, If you did not use the =-prefix= option the default value =user= will be used and the resulting certificate will consist of the two files (usercert.pem and userkey.pem).

%ICON{warning}% Please note that these files represent a %RED%public%ENDCOLOR% and a %RED%private%ENDCOLOR% and should be treated accordingly!

Please take a moment to verify that the *certificate matches the hostname* of the resource where you intend to install it before you proceed:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% grid-cert-info -file ./hostcert.pem -subject
/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=%RED%%UCL_HOST_FQDN%%ENDCOLOR%

%UCL_PROMPT% hostname -f
%RED%%UCL_HOST_FQDN%%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

Finally, install the certificate in the default location */etc/grid-security/*:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cp ./%UCL_HOST_FQDN%cert.pem /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem

</pre>

---+ Request a Service Certificate

Web services on the grid require a *Service Certificate* to establish their identity with the grid user accessing the service. %RED%Please do not reuse your host certificate as a service certificate!%ENDCOLOR%

A Service Certificate can be requested in the same way as a host certificate. To proceed you will need following information at hand:

   * the *fully qualified domain* name of the host you need a service certificate for
   * the *purpose* of the certificate that explains your request to the Certificate Authority
   * the full *name of the administrator* responsible for the host
   * the *e-mail address of the administrator*
   * the *telephone number of the administrator*
   * the name of the *Certificate Authority* your project is affiliated with
   * the name of the *Virtual Organization* affiliated with the Certificate Authority

Next we will use *cert-request* to generate a request which will be sent to the Certificate Authority you specified:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% cert-request -ou s -service %RED%http%ENDCOLOR% -host %RED%%UCL_HOST_FQDN%%ENDCOLOR% -dir %RED%.%ENDCOLOR% -label %RED%%UCL_HOST_FQDN%-http%ENDCOLOR%

---+ Frequently Asked Questions

---++ Can I use any host to request a certificate for a different host?

%GREEN%YES%ENDCOLOR%, you can use any host to create a certificate request as long as the hostname for the certificate is a fully qualified domain name.

---++ Can I not just reuse my host certificate as a service certificate?

%RED%NO!%ENDCOLOR% For security reasons, please do not use clones of your host certificate for additional certificates even though it's technically possible.

---++ May I reuse my host certificate for the web service implementation of GRAM?

%GREEN%YES%ENDCOLOR%, this is the only exception to reuse your host certificate for another service. In this case the OSG configuration software will copy your host certificate to =/etc/grid-security/container(cert|key).pem= and change the owner to the *globus* or *daemon* user. Choose the username that executes the globus container.

---++ I get a "GSS authentication failure" when users try to authenticate with my site?

You likely used an *alias* for the host instead of the fully qualified domain name when you generated the certificate request. This can cause the GSS authentication failures similar to the following when a user tries to authenticate to the host after your certificate is installed:

<pre class="screen">
GSS authentication failure 
GSS Major Status: General failure 
GSS Minor Status Error Chain: 
accept_sec_context.c:gss_accept_sec_context:403: 
Error during delegation: Delegation protocol violation 
Failure: GSS failed Major:000d0000 Minor:00000001 Token:00000000 
</pre>

---++ How can I check if I have a host certificate installed already?

By default the host certificate key pair will be installed in =/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem=.  You can use *openssl* to access basic information about the certificate:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se robert]# openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -subject -issuer -dates -noout
subject= /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=%UCL_HOST_FQDN%
issuer= /DC=org/DC=DOEGrids/OU=Certificate Authorities/CN=DOEGrids CA 1
notBefore=Jan  4 21:08:41 2010 GMT
notAfter=Jan  4 21:08:41 2011 GMT
</pre>

---++ How can I check the expiration time of my installed host certificate?

If you installed the [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates#Install_the_Certificate_Scripts][Certificates Script Package]] you can use *grid-cert-info* to retrieve information about the certificate:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se robert]# grid-cert-info -file /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -startdate -enddate
Jan  4 21:08:41 2010 GMT
Jan  4 21:08:41 2011 GMT
</pre>

Alternatively you can use *openssl*:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se robert]# openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -dates -noout
notBefore=Jan  4 21:08:41 2010 GMT
notAfter=Jan  4 21:08:41 2011 GMT
</pre>

---++ Comments

%COMMENT{type="tableappend"}%
   * A second thing I was confused about which I put below.  Sometimes the argument to -prefix and -label must be different or you get a question when you issue cert-retrieve.  Other times, it appears it is okay.  If in general the uses and abuses of -prefix and -label could be made clearer in this document I think that would help. -- Main.DavidSaltzberg - 21 Jul 2010 - 12:56
