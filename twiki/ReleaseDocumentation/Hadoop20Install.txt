---+ Preparation
---++ Introduction

[[http://hadoop.apache.org/hdfs/][Hadoop Distributed File System]] (HDFS) is a scalable reliable distributed file system developed in the Apache project. It is based on map-reduce framework and design of the Google file system. The VDT distribution of Hadoop includes all components needed to operate a multi-terabyte storage site. Included are:

   * An [[https://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-wg/doc/SRM.v2.2.html][SRM interface]] for grid access; 
   * !GridFTP-HDFS as transport layer; and  
   * A [[http://fuse.sourceforge.net/][FUSE interface]] for localized POSIX access.
   * [[http://hadoop.apache.org/][Apache Hadoop]]

The VDT packaging and distribution of Hadoop is based on YUM. All components are packaged as RPMs. Two YUM repositories are available: 
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/stable/2.0/][Stable repository]] for wider deployments and production usage.
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/testing/2.0/][Testing repository]] for limited deployments and pre-release evaluation.

The *stable YUM repository* is enabled by default through the *osg-hadoop-20 RPM*, and contains the *golden release* supported by OSG for LHC operations. 

---+++ VDT Downloads webpage

The VDT Downloads webpage is http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/hadoop.html

---+++ VDT Release notes webpage

The VDT Release notes are available at http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/release-notes.html

---+++ Note on upgrading from Hadoop 0.19

If you already have a working Hadoop 0.19 system and would like to upgrade to 0.20, please get familiar with this document first and then proceed to follow the [[Storage.HadoopUpgrade][upgrade instructions here]].

---++ Architecture

This diagram shows the suggested topology and distribution of services at a Hadoop site. Major service components and modules which need to be deployed on the various nodes are listed. Please use this as a recommendation to prepare for the Hadoop deployment procedure at your site.

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Hadoop-site-architecture.png">

%NOTE% Throughout this document it will be stated which node the relevant installation instructions apply to.  It can apply to one of the following:
   * *Namenode*
   * *Datanode*
   * *Secondary Namenode*
   * *GridFTP node* (can be installed on the same machine as a Datanode)
   *  *SRM node*

---+!!Engineering Considerations

Please read the [[Storage.HadoopUnderstanding][planning document]] to understand different components of the system. 

---+!!Help!
Total installation time, on an average, should not exceed 8 to 24 man-hours. If your site needs further assistance to help expedite, please email osg-storage@opensciencegrid.org and osg-hadoop@opensciencegrid.org.

---+ Installation Procedure

Main server components can be divided in 3 categories: 
   * HDFS core: Namenode, Datanode.
   * Grid extensions: [[https://sdm.lbl.gov/bestman/][BeStMan2 SRM]], [[http://dev.globus.org/wiki/GridFTP][Globus !GridFTP]], [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/ProbeInstallation][Gratia probe]], and [[http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/][Xrootd server plugin]] etc.
   * HDFS auxiliary: Secondary Namenode, Hadoop Balancer.

Main client components are [[http://fuse.sourceforge.net/][FUSE]] and Hadoop command line client.

---+ Initializer RPM

%NOTE% This must be done on *all nodes*

---++ Initializing the YUM Repository

Download and install the =osg-hadoop-20= RPM on *all nodes*. This will initialize the OSG YUM repository for Hadoop.

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -Uvh http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/osg-hadoop-20-3.el5.noarch.rpm
</pre>

This initializes YUM repository configuration in =/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-hadoop.repo=. 

---++ Choosing Stable or ITB Repository

%NOTE% %RED% *For Trash/Trash/Integration Testbed (ITB) Sites:* %ENDCOLOR% 
   * By default, *Stable Repository* is enabled (=enabled=1=) in the YUM configuration. Production sites should use the default setting.
   * ITB sites doing testing can enable the *Testing Repository* to fetch pre-release packages. 

Simply set =enabled=0= in =[hadoop]= section and =enabled=1= in =[hadoop-testing]= section of =/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-hadoop.repo=.

*YUM Repository types in /etc/yum.repos.d/osg-hadoop.repo*

---+ Installing Hadoop

%NOTE% Hadoop must be installed on the following nodes:
   * *Namenode*
   * *Datanode*
   * *Secondary Namenode*

%NOTE% On the following nodes Hadoop must also be installed but the Hadoop service itself does not need to be started:
   * *GridFTP node*
   * *SRM node*

---++ Prerequisites

%INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20Installation" section="Prereqs"}%

---++ Installation

%INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20Installation" section="Prep"}%

The only node that requires a FUSE mount is the *SRM node*.  However to install hadoop, the =hadoop-0.20-osg= rpm requires =fuse= and =fuse-libs= packages to be installed.  If you are using RHEL >= 5.4 this requirement is met and they will be brought in as dependencies.  Otherwise you must find these packages for your platform or refer to [[#TroubFuseMod][Notes on Building a FUSE Module]] in the Troubleshooting section below.

To install hadoop, run:

%INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20Installation" section="Install"}%

---++ Configuration

%INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20Installation" section="Config" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%

---++ Running Hadoop

%INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20Installation" section="Running" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%

---++ FUSE

A FUSE mount is only required on the *SRM node* and any other node you would like to use standard POSIX-like commands on the Hadoop filesystem. If these cases don't apply you may skip to the [[#HadoopValidation][Hadoop Validation]] section.

%NOTE% Before using FUSE you may need to add the module using =modprobe= first:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% modprobe fuse
</pre>

#FuseMount
---+++ Mounting FUSE at Boot Time 

You can %INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20Installation" section="Fuse"}%

If you have troubles mounting FUSE refer to [[#TroubFuseDeb][Running FUSE in Debug Mode]] in the Troubleshooting section.

#HadoopValidation
---++ Validation

The first thing you may want to do after installing and starting your *Namenode* is to verify that the web interface works.  In your web browser go to:

<pre class="file">
http://%RED%namenode.hostname%ENDCOLOR%:50070/dfshealth.jsp
</pre>

%ENDTWISTY%
</pre>

An online guide is also available at [[http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/commands_manual.html][Apache Hadoop commands manual]].
You can use Hadoop commands to perform filesystem operations with more consistency.

Example, to look into the internal hadoop namespace:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% hadoop fs -ls /
Found 1 items
drwxrwxr-x   - engage engage          0 2011-07-25 06:32 /engage
</pre>

Example, to adjust ownership of filesystem areas (there is usually no need to specify the mount itself =/mnt/hadoop= in Hadoop commands):

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% hadoop fs -chown -R engage:engage /engage
</pre>

Example, compare =hadoop fs= command vs. using FUSE mount:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% hadoop fs -ls /engage
Found 3 items
-rw-rw-r--   2 engage engage  733669376 2011-06-15 16:55 /engage/CentOS-5.6-x86_64-LiveCD.iso

</pre>

---++ Creating VO and User filesystem areas

Prior to starting basic day-to-day operations, it is important to create dedicated areas for each VO and/or user. This is similar to user management in simple UNIX filesystems. 

%NOTE% Create (and maintain) usernames and groups with UIDs and GIDs on *all nodes*. These are maintained in basic system files such as =/etc/passwd= and =/etc/group=.

%NOTE% In the examples below It is assumed a FUSE mount is set to =/mnt/hadoop=.  As an alternative =hadoop fs= commands could have been used.

For clean HDFS operations and filesystem management:

(a) Create top-level VO subdirectories under =/mnt/hadoop=.

Example: 

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir /mnt/hadoop/cms
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir /mnt/hadoop/dzero
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir /mnt/hadoop/sbgrid
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir /mnt/hadoop/fermigrid
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir /mnt/hadoop/cmstest
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir /mnt/hadoop/osg
</pre>

(b) Create individual top-level user areas, under each VO area, as needed.

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/tanyalevshina
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/michaelthomas
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/brianbockelman
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/douglasstrain
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/abhisheksinghrana
</pre>

(c) Adjust username:group ownership of each area. 

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown -R cms:cms /mnt/hadoop/cms
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown -R sam:sam /mnt/hadoop/dzero

%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown -R michaelthomas:cms /mnt/hadoop/cms/store/user/michaelthomas
</pre>

---+ Installing !GridFTP

%NOTE% !GridFTP must be installed on the *GridFTP node*

---++ Prerequisites

   1. %INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20GridFTP" section="HadoopReq"}%
   1. %INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20GridFTP" section="GumsReq"}%

---++ Running !GridFTP 

%INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20GridFTP" section="Running"}%

---++ Validation

%NOTE% The commands used to verify !GridFTP below assume you have access to a node where you can first generate a valid proxy using =voms-proxy-init= or =grid-proxy-init=.  Obtaining grid credentials is beyond the scope of this document.

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-url-copy file:///home/users/jdost/test.txt gsiftp://devg-7.t2.ucsd.edu:2811/mnt/hadoop/engage/test.txt
</pre>

If you are having troubles running !GridFTP refer to [[#GridFTPStand][Starting !GridFTP in Standalone Mode]] in the Troubleshooting section.

---+ Installing !BeStMan2

%NOTE% !BeStMan2 must be installed on the *SRM node*

---++ Prerequisites
   1. Make sure FUSE is installed and [[#FuseMount][mounted]] on the *SRM node*.
   1.  A !GridFTP-HDFS server must also be installed, but this does not need to be on the same node as the !BeStMan2 server.  A larger site will prefer to have their !GridFTP and !BeStMan2 servers installed on separate hosts.
   1 In addition to the Java jdk you need the corresponding Java sun-compat package.  For example for =jdk-1.6.0= you need to install =java-1.6.0-sun-compat=.  If you installed the jdk rpm that we supplied you can just let =java-1.6.0-sun-compat= come in as a dependency.  Otherwise you need to find and manually install the correct version before continuing.  See the [[http://www.jpackage.org/installation.php][jpackage installation doc]] for more details.
   1 CA Certificates installed in =/etc/grid-security/certificates=.

%INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20SRM" section="Prereqs"}%

---++ Installation

%INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20SRM" section="Install"}%

---++ Configuration

%INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20SRM" section="Config1"}%

!BeStMan2 SRM uses the Hadoop FUSE mount to perform namespace operations, such as mkdir, rm, and ls.  As per the Hadoop install instructions, edit =/etc/sysconfig/hadoop= and run =service hadoop-firstboot start=.  It is *not* necessary (or even recommended) to start any hadoop services with =service hadoop start=.

%INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20SRM" section="Config2"}%

---++ Running !BeStMan2

%INCLUDE{"Storage/Hadoop20SRM" section="Running"}%

---+++ copyFromLocal java IOException

When trying to copy a local file into Hadoop you may come across the following java exception:

<pre class="screen">

This can occur if you try to install a Datanode on a machine with less than 10GB of disk space available.  This can be changed by lowering the value of the following property in =/usr/lib/hadoop-0.20/conf/hdfs-site.xml=:

<verbatim class="file">
<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.du.reserved</name>
  <value>10000000000</value>
</property>
</verbatim>

Hadoop always requires this amount of disk space to be available for non-hdfs usage on the machine.
