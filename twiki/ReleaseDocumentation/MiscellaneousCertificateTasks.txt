---++ About This Document

This document is intended as a reference on specific tasks for users who already have
a certificate. Users who need a new certificate should instead go to the
[[ReleaseDocumentation.CertificateGetWebNew][Getting a User Certificate]]
page. 

---++ Renewing an Unexpired Certificate

If you have a valid DOEGrids certificate in your web browser that is
not expired or revoked, then you can renew it by following these
instructions:

   1 Go to the [[https://software.grid.iu.edu/cert/certrenew.php][Replacement Certificate]] page.
   1 Verify that the certificate DN and the expiry date (in red) are
     correct and refer to the certificate you wish to renew.
      * If the certificate listed is incorrect, please make sure that
        you have the appropriate certificate installed in the browser
        and presented to the page when prompted. You may have to close
        the browser session and select the correct certificate to be
        presented to the page when prompted.
   1 Select the appropriate Key Length or Cryptographic Provider
     (depending upon your browser):
      * Cryptographic Provider: 
         * Linux or other Unix Mozilla/Firefox/Netscape users: Select 2048(High grade). 
         * Windows Mozilla/Firefox/Netscape users: Select Strong Cryptographic Provider. 
         * Windows Internet Explorer users: Select Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider.
   1 If you receive any prompts about trusting this CA or certificate
     being installed, select Yes.
   1 Then you will see a message that your certificate has been
      successfully imported. *Click OK*.
   1 The browser will display your certificate in base 64 encoded format.
   1 Check your email. You should have received a message from
      DOEGrids.
   1 Your new certificate should now be imported. To check this in
     Firefox, go to the certificate manager:
     [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Menu_differences_in_Windows,_Linux,_and_Mac][Options/Preferences]] -> Advanced -> Encryption -> View Certificates -> Your  Certificates.
     If the new certificate is not there, follow
     the link to the URL given in the email message and click the
     _Import_ button, as directed in the email message.
   1 If you are an OSG RA Agent or Grid Admin, you will need to send
     email signed by your new certificate to renew your Agent or Grid
     Admin role. See [[Security.OsgRaOperations]] for details.


---++ Replacing an Expired Certificate

This section applies if you had a certificate from DOEgrids CA
previously and the certificate is expired after a year. You need to
get a new certificate, but you want have the same
[[Documentation.GlossaryD#DefsDistinguishedName][DN]] since then you
can continue accessing resources without any re-configuration or
changes.

Follow the steps for [[ReleaseDocumentation.CertificateGetWebNew][getting a new certificate]]
but enter your old DN in the "Expired DN" field.

How to find your old DN:

With openssl:
   1 Create a pem format certificate from the p12 format certificate that you
   had exported:
   <pre class="screen">
     openssl pkcs12 -clcerts -nokeys -in usercred.p12 -out usercert.pem   </pre>
   1 Get the DN from this:
   <pre class="screen">
        openssl x509 -noout -subject -in usercert.pem   </pre>

In Firefox:
   1 Go to go to [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Menu_differences_in_Windows,_Linux,_and_Mac][Options/Preferences]] -> Advanced -> Encryption -> View Certificates -> Your Certificates
   1 Double click on your certificate.
   1 Then click on "Details", select "Subject" from the list in the middle,
    and "Field Value" in the box at the bottom is your subject.


---++ Importing a p12 Certificate from Disk

Here is how to import your certificate to another
installation of Firefox.

   1. Copy your p12 Certificate to the disk where
   the other Firefox is running.
   1. In Firefox, go to
     [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Menu_differences_in_Windows,_Linux,_and_Mac][Options/Preferences]] -> Advanced -> Encryption -> View Certificates,
   and click on the "Import" button.
   %TWISTY{
   showlink="Screenshot"
   hidelink="Hide"
   showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
   hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
   }%
   %BR%
     %ATTACHURL%/import_certificate_1.png
   %ENDTWISTY{}%
   1. Navigate to the certificate location and "Open" it.
   1. Type in the password you used when you exported
   the certificate.
   1. Finally you will get a message that the import worked:
    %ATTACHURL%/import_certificate_5.png %BR%
  And the newly imported certificate should show up in Firefox's
  Certificate Manager window, which in Step 2 was empty.
