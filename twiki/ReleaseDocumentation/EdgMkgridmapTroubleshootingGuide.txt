%ICON{hand}% This document is for System Administrators. It aims to provide assistance in troubleshooting problems related to creation and usage of the =edg-mkgridmap= script. The =edg-mkgridmap= script is used to maintain the =grid-mapfile= at sites that do not relay on %LINK_GLOSSARY_GUMS% servers by downloading information from VOMS servers.

%STARTINCLUDE%

---%SHIFT%+ Common Problems

   * [[#NoMapfile][grid-mapfile not created]]
   * [[#UserNotincluded][Local users not included in the grid mapfile]]
   * [[#CodeSixtyfour][Error code 64]]

%STARTSECTION{"Troubleshooting"}%   
---%SHIFT%++ Troubleshooting Procedure

In case of problems first of all check the service log file =$VDT_LOCATION/edg/log/edg-mkgridmap.log=. This file lists:

   * any errors accessing individual voms servers or any general errors
   * any mappings eliminated from the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/osg-user-vo-map.txt= and =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/osg-supported-vo-list.txt= files where the Unix account a user would be mapped to does not exist.  There is an =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/osg-undefined-accounts.txt= file created that lists these accounts.
   * changes from the last time the script was run

There is also a _last_checked_ file in =/etc/grid-security= that tells you the last time the cron process was run successfully (the =grid-mapfile= only gets updated if there is a difference from the previous run).

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% ls -al /etc/grid-security
-rw-r--r--  1 root     root     1162888 Jul 12 02:14 grid-mapfile
-rw-r--r--  1 root     root           0 Jul 12 08:14 grid-mapfile.last_checked
</pre>

#NoMapfile
---%SHIFT%++ Grid-Mapfile was not created

First use =vdt-control --list= and make sure that the _edg-mkgridmap_ service is enabled:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --list edg-mkgridmap
Service                 | Type   | Desired State
------------------------+--------+--------------
edg-mkgridmap           | cron   | %GREEN%enable%ENDCOLOR% 
</pre>

Next, use =crontab -l= to list all crontab entries for the _root_ user. Make sure an entry for _edg-mkgridmap_ is present:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% crontab -l | grep edg-mkgridmap
59 13,19,1,7 * * * %UCL_CWD%/edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap >> %UCL_CWD%/edg/log/edg-mkgridmap.log 2>&1
</pre>

%NOTE% If no entry for _edg-mkgridmap_ is present, use =vdt-control -on= to _activate_ the service.

Last, run the =edg-mkgridmap= script on the command line and check that =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile= gets created:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% %UCL_CWD%/edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap
</pre>

%NOTE% The script will not output to the command line. Check the log file at =%UCL_CWD%/edg/log/edg-mkgridmap.log= instead.

#UserNotincluded
---%SHIFT%++ Grid-Mapfile does not list Local Users

Check the configuration file =$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf=. It should contain:

<pre class="file">
#### GMF_LOCAL: gmf_local grid-mapfile-local
gmf_local /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile-local
</pre>

Then make sure the file =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile-local= contains the desired %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN% to Unix account mappings.

#CodeSixtyfour
---%SHIFT%++ Error Code 64

This type of error occurs when the script established contact with the VOMS server but the requested group or subgroup does not exist there. It is really a _'not found'_ type error.  It is usually caused by a bad entry in the =$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf= file.

In the example below the configuration file contains a request for the VOMS server to send a list of all members of the uscms VO belonging to a non-existent =/uscms/production= group.

Configuration file =VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf= entry:

<pre class="file">
 group vomss://voms.fnal.gov:8443/voms/uscms/production uscms01
</pre>

Command run on CE node:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.(c)sh 
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cd $VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin 
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% ./edg-mkgridmap
   <i>... output....
  voms search(https://voms.fnal.gov:8443/voms/uscms/production/services/VOMSAdmin?method=listMembers): /voms/uscms/production/services/VOMSAdmin

   Exit with error(s) (code=64)</i>
</pre>

On the VOMS host you are attempting to access, the following error can be seen in the =TOMCAT_LOCATION/logs/voms-admin.VO_NAME.log=

<pre class="file">
2005-05-26 15:51:04,003 INFO  [Ajp13Processor[8892][1]]  Connection from "131.225.82.73" by

 </pre>
