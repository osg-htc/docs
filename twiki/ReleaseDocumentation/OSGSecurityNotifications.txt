---++ About This Document
This document discusses the importance of reading and keeping up-to-date on the OSG security notices that are sent out.  There is an example of what a security notice will look like, and how to check the PGP signature.

---++ Read Security Notifications from OSG
OSG sends out security notifications to all security contacts when important events occur, such as a vulnerability notice requiring a software update.  If you receive a notice you are expected to read it and the detailed information linked to a GOC ticket (if there is a link).  The OSG security team also keeps a blog of all old and current security announcements and notifications at: http://osgsec.blogspot.com/

%NOTE% You will need your personal certificate that is registered with OIM in your browser in order to read the details of the notice in the ticket.

Email notices will look similar to:

OSG Security Contacts,

The OSG Security Team wants to inform you of an increased risk to the
OSG infrastructure. No immediate action is required. We are sharing
this information with you so you can use it to better protect your
systems and monitor for misuse. Details are available at:

https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=XXXX

To access the above URL, you must authenticate with the certificate
you have registered in OIM.

Please contact security@opensciencegrid.org to report any security
incidents or if you have any questions or concerns.

This message is digitally signed. We encourage you to verify the
digital signatures on OSG security announcements according to:

https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SecureEmail

Sincerely,
Jim Basney
on behalf of the OSG Security Team

</pre>

Any subsequent correspondence you have about a particular notice should include the
OSG-SEC-NOTIFY tag in the subject line (<tt>OSG-SEC-NOTIFY-2009-06-20</tt> in the example above).

As indicated, the notice should be digitally signed either as S/MIME with an X.509 certificate, or using PGP key from security@opensciencegrid.org.  If you do not know how to verify signed emails then go to [[Documentation.SecureEmail][Secure Email]] and we will explain step-by-step how to do this.

Using PGP for these messages, rather than S/MIME based on grid certificates, is useful for several reasons. The PGP trust is separate from the X.509 PKI trust basis and can still be used if something compromises the PKI trust used for all grid computational transactions. Also, PGP keys do not expire in a year so you can always read old emails. You do not need to understand all these details, although you are welcome to ask questions if you wish to learn. We just expect you to be able to verify PGP encrypted or X.509 encrypted emails.  OSG security team uses PGP keys in email communications because they are easier to work with. However, at some point in time you may need to verify X.509 encrypted emails because all of the grid software is built on X.509 certificates.
