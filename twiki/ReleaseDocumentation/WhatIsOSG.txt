---+ Open Science Grid: A User Introduction

This page is an introduction to the <b>O</b>pen <b>S</b>cience <b>G</b>rid (*OSG*) from a user point-of-view.  [[Documentation/UsingTheGrid][The top-level user navigation is located here]].

The <b>O</b>pen <b>S</b>cience <b>G</b>rid (*OSG*) provides access to a *international Grid of computing and storage resources*.  We provide common service and support for resource providers and scientific institutions using it. The OSG does not own resources but provides software and services to users and resource providers alike to enable the opportunistic usage and sharing of resources. The OSG is jointly funded by the [[http://www.energy.gov/][Department of Energy]] and the [[http://www.nsf.gov/][National Science Foundation]].

High-throughput computing needs of our scientific users are being met by a [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/map?all_sites=on&active=on&active_value=1&disable_value=1&gridtype=on&gridtype_1=on#39.232253,-96.591797|4|Terrain large number of computing resources]] that can be accessed directly through *Globus* services or more conveniently through grid technologies build on top of them. Storage resources provide _easy_ access to terabytes of storage space through the common *SRM* protocol. The resources contributing to the OSG are primarily Linux clusters with Ethernet interconnects.

   * Derek, the links are good, but funding agencies really like to see their logos on the page. You can either attach an image to the page (see bottom of page for how to do that) or use a remote image (http://...) and link it (<img src="http://...). If you have a problem positioning the image, let me know and I'll do some css to get it to show nicely ( float right top for instance ).
   * OSG is international, should we change from national to international?

This page is an introduction to the OSG from a user point-of-view.  [[Documentation/UsingTheGrid][The top-level user navigation is located here]].

The <b>O</b>pen <b>S</b>cience <b>G</b>rid (*OSG*) provides a national cyber-infrastructure of *distributed computing and storage resources.*  It provides a common service, support, and infrastructure for resource providers and scientific institutions who need to utilize it.  The OSG is jointly funded by the [[http://www.energy.gov/][Department of Energy]] and the [[http://www.nsf.gov/][National Science Foundation]].

The resources contributing to the OSG are primarily Linux (!RedHat) clusters with ethernet interconnects.  

The storage resources are usually large, distributed storage systems; all have access through a common protocol and some can be accessed transparently through normal (POSIX) mounts on the cluster nodes.  Most computing and storage resources are owned by one or two organizations (such as a physics experiment) and many will provide access to outside users who do not own the resources.  The OSG does not own the resources, but by using our software and services, one can utilize the them.  This is called "opportunistic access".  Not all organizations have peak usage at the same time.  Therefore, there are usually many thousands of CPUs available for opportunistic use on the OSG, but the free CPUs may not always belong to the same site.  By using the OSG's software and services, you can get opportunistic access - in addition to better utilizing the distributed resources your organization may own.

---+ Succeeding on the OSG

The OSG is primarily used as a _high-throughput grid_ where scientific problems are solved by breaking them down into a very large number of individual jobs that can run independently. The _%GREEN%most successful opportunistic applications%ENDCOLOR%_ run on the OSG share the following characteristics:

   * The application is a Linux application for the x86 or x86_64 architecture.
   * The application is single- or multi-threaded but does not require message passing.
   * The application has a small runtime between 1 and 24 hours.
   * The application can handle being unexpectedly killed, and restarted.
   * The application is build from software that does not require to contact licensing servers.
   * The scientific problem can be described as a workflow consisting of jobs of such kind.
   * The scientific problem requires to run a very large number of small jobs rather than a few large jobs.

Other applications may succeed, but users may have difficult barriers to surmount. Some characteristics of _%RED%applications that do not run well%ENDCOLOR%_ opportunistically on the OSG are:

   * The application requires message passing and a low-latency local network.
   * The application requires a long runtime and cannot be checkpointed through signal _TERM_.
   * The application workflow cannot tolerate preemptions or individual jobs crashing at remote sites.
   * The application requires complex software and specific environments that cannot be easily met on resources.
   * The application requires administrator privileges for its operation.

---+ Virtual Organizations

A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Organization_%28Grid_computing%29][<b>V</b>irtual <b>O</b>rganization]] (*VO*) is a set of groups or individuals defined by some common cyber-infrastructure need. This can be _a scientific experiment_, _a university campus_ or _a distributed research effort_. A VO represents all its members and their common needs in a grid environment.

Many VOs in the OSG address the specific requirements of their users with their own user support that provides more in-depth help than the OSG does ([[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/vo][See here!]]). Additionally some VOs provide dedicated resources to the OSG that provide preferred access to their members. Some VOs provide a problem specific user interface to their members. 

The OSG assumes that each user is preferably supported by their membership VO.  Each VO is expected to register with the OSG and provide support for their members. OSG support is maintained through a VO representative for each VO rather than a member of a VO.

*The OSG welcomes researchers that are not associated with a VO!* They are welcome to join the _OSG_ or _Engage_ VO. The OSG VO is inviting all users who don't need support running their application on the OSG. The Engage VO provides strong support for scientists who wish to bring their applications to the grid but who are unfamiliar with grid technologies. 

%ICON{hand}% If you don't know what VO you belong to or should belong to, we suggest doing that before moving on; [[ReleaseDocumentation/TroubleTickets][you can file a trouble ticket for this]] or email [[mailto:goc@opensciencegrid.org][Grid Operations Center]] for help.

<!--
Virtual Organizations (VOs) are at the heart of OSG principles and its model for operation. VOs are a collection of researchers who join together to accomplish their goals; typically they share the same mission, but that is not a requirement for establishing an OSG VO. A VO joins OSG to share their resources, computing and storage, with the other OSG VOs and to be able to access the resources provided by other OSG VOs as well as share data and resources with international computer grids (e.g. EGEE). The resources owned by a VO are often geographically distributed; a set of co-located resources are referred to as a site and thus a VO may own a number of sites. There are two key aspects of VOs: 1) the user community within a VO that submits jobs into the OSG; and 2) the set of computing and storage resources that are owned by a VO and connected to the OSG. In some cases, VOs do not bring resources to OSG and are only users of available resources on OSG.

A key principle in OSG is the autonomy of VOs that allows them to develop an operational model that best meets their science needs; this autonomy applies both to their user community and sites. OSG requires each VO to establish certain roles (i.e. VO manager, VO admin, VO Security Contact) and agree to a set of policies (e.g. Acceptable Use Policy) which allow operation of the OSG as a secure and efficient grid. VOs administer, manage, and support their own user community.	In addition, many VOs provide common software infrastructure designed to meet the specific needs of their users.	VOs as providers of resources also have great autonomy in building and

operating their sites. Sites use the OSG software stack to provide the “middleware layers” that make their sites ready for connection to the OSG. Sites set policies on how their resources will be used by their own users and other VOs; the only requirement is that sites support at least one other VO but the site controls the conditions under which that resource is available. OSG does not tightly restrict what hardware or operating system software a VO may supply or what software it may use to access OSG or provide resources on OSG: they are autonomous and are allowed to make such choices as long as they meet the basic requirements. This autonomy allows a VO to build its computing resource to meet its specific needs and makes it more likely that a VO will choose to join OSG because it doesn’t have to compromise its own needs to do so.

Software Platform
The primary goal of the OSG software effort is to build, integrate, test, distribute, and support a set of common software for OSG administrators and users. OSG strives to provide a software stack that is easy to install and configure even though it depends on a large variety of complex software.
The key to making the OSG infrastructure work is a common package of software provided and supported by OSG called the OSG Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT).	The VDT includes Condor and Globus technologies with additional modules for security, storage and data management, workflow and other higher level services, as well as administrative software for testing, accounting and monitoring. The needs of the domain and computer scientists, together with the needs of the administrators of the resources, services and VOs, drive the contents and schedule of releases of the VDT. The OSG middleware allows the VOs to build an operational environment that is customized to their needs.
The OSG supports a heterogeneous set of operating systems and versions and provides software that publishes what is available on each resource. This allows the users and/or applications to dispatch work to those resources that are able to execute it. Also, through installation of the VDT, users and administrators operate in a well-defined environment and set of available services.
Common Services and Support
To enable the work of the VOs, the OSG provides direct staff support and operates a set of services. These functions are available to all VOs in OSG and provide a foundation for the specific environments built, operated, and supported by each VO; these include:

The Open Science Grid is proud to support a wide range of scientific research activities, among them:

   * Astrophysics: [[http://www.ligo.org LIGO]]
   * High Energy Physics: [[http://cms.web.cern.ch/cms/index.html CMS]] and [[http://atlas.ch/ ATLAS]]
   * Nanoscience: [[http://nanohub.org/ NANOHUB]]
   * Structural Biology: [[http://sbgrid.org/ SBGrid]]
   * Community VO (multiple sciences): [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Engagement/WebHome Engage]]

Recent statistics [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/vo?set=Non-HEP%20VOs&vo=nanohub|glow|sdss|dteam|ligo|osg|engage|osgedu|tigre|nysgrid|cigi|compbiogrid|des|fmri|gpn|grase|gugrid|i2u2|mariachi|nwicg|sbgrid|star show]] that  [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/xml/osg_sharing_sites_pie_perc][one third]] of the resources are used opportunistically by VOs that do not own resources and who benefit from the grid effort of the OSG. The OSG continues to grow and is currently supporting 30 [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/vosummary?datasource=summary&all_vos=on&active_value=1][VOs]] at 80 sites. More than [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/byvo][800,000 cpu hours]] are turned into scientific results by their members every day. 


<!--
%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
   * I think we need more science examples.
   * The 30 VOs need a link where one can see them. - Done
   * The 80 sites need a link as well - Will wait for Nebraska in the center to not be a giant red X.
   * a picture of the OSG is always an eye catcher - like the one in mysog where you can see the resources on a map, but I don't know how to get this easily. Any idea? - Will combine above with picture.
