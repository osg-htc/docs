---++ About This Document

This document aims to provide assistance for the systems administrators whose Compute Elements interface to the SGE batch system.
%STARTINCLUDE%

Here are some details that are needed to get an SGE batch system work with the Compute Element and for the monitoring system to correctly report  submitted jobs. 

---++Installation environment
Prior to installing =Globus-SGE-Setup= make sure that your environment points to the appropriate SGE installation. This is usually done by sourcing the SGE setup file =/path-to-sge/common/settings.sh= . This should define the variables =$SGE_ROOT= and =$SGE_CELL=.
---++Gratia accounting 
For Gratia to work "accounting" must be turned on: <pre class=screen><b>$qconf -mconf</b> 
...snip... 
reporting_params  	accounting=true, ...
... snip ...
</pre>
Also Gratia reporting does not work if your accounting file rotates. In case you have a rotating accounting file please open a ticket with =GOC= to get help.
---++SGE and WS-GRAM
For WS-GRAM to work "reporting" must be turned on <pre class=screen><b>$qconf -mconf</b> 
...snip... 
reporting_params  	..., reporting=true, ...
...snip...
</pre>

As of OSG 1.0 release, the SGE-GT4 adaptor handles rotating the =reporting= file when the rotation follows the SGE standard model of <pre class=screen>
<b>reporting</b> is current file
<b>reporting.0</b> is previous file
...snip...
<b>reporting.9</b> is oldest file
</pre>  
WS-GRAM will not work if SGE's ARCO service is also being run on the installation as that tool deletes the =reporting= file with each read.  The effect is that jobs are submitted and pass thru the  batch system but GRAM never registers that the submission occurred.
