---+ Introduction
This document is intended for administrators seeking to validate that their resource is reporting correctly to the BDII collectors and for ITB participants to verify that the BDII reporting is working correctly on their resources.

%NOTE%  This page refers to the ldapsearch command.  The ldapsearch command is not part of the standard OSG installation, it is commonly
on many standard linux installations. If you do not have it and would like to get it
from the VDT it is part of the VDT OpenLDAP package that can be pulled using pacman
and refer to the VDT Package 'OpenLDAP.'

---++ Validating BDII

   * Check the GIP validator 
      * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/wizardgipstatus/index?datasource=gipstatus&summary_attrs_showservice=on&summary_attrs_showrsvstatus=on&summary_attrs_showfqdn=on&gip_status_attrs_showtestresults=on&gip_status_attrs_showfqdn=on&account_type=cumulative_hours&ce_account_type=gip_vo&se_account_type=vo_transfer_volume&start_type=7daysago&start_date=02%2F23%2F2009&end_type=now&end_date=03%2F02%2F2009&all_resources=on&gridtype=on&gridtype_1=on&service=on&service_1=on&active_value=1&disable_value=1][BDII at myosg]]  %RED% for production%ENDCOLOR%
      * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/wizardgipstatus/index?datasource=gipstatus&summary_attrs_showservice=on&summary_attrs_showrsvstatus=on&summary_attrs_showfqdn=on&gip_status_attrs_showtestresults=on&gip_status_attrs_showfqdn=on&account_type=cumulative_hours&ce_account_type=gip_vo&se_account_type=vo_transfer_volume&start_type=7daysago&start_date=02%2F23%2F2009&end_type=now&end_date=03%2F02%2F2009&all_resources=on&gridtype=on&gridtype_2=on&service=on&service_1=on&active_value=1&disable_value=1][BDII at myosg]] %RED%  for ITB %ENDCOLOR%
   * Next check your system is reporting using the following command.  If your resource is a production resource, you need to query =is.grid.iu.edu= instead of =is-itb.grid.iu.edu=
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% ldapsearch -x -LLL -p 2170 -h is-itb.grid.iu.edu -b mds-vo-name=YOUR_SITE_NAME_HERE,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid
</pre>
   * If the information if not being reported correctly, run the following on your CE
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% $VDT_LOCATION/gip/bin/gip_info
</pre>
If this information is correct, then your local GIP is configured correctly.
   * If your information is still not reported to BDII, you might have a problem with the CEMon publishing service. To troubleshoot your CEMon installation see the [[Trash/Trash/ResourceSelection.CEMonTroubleshootingGuide][CEMon troubleshooting guide]].
