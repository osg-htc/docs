---++ Introduction
Here we describe creation of the needed accounts for the tutorial.   Note what we are describing here is the simplest method to setup accounts across a test cluster using password files.  Accounts on clusters are usually managed with a service such as NIS or LDAP.

---++ Controlling password lookups
The =/etc/nsswitch.conf= file controls both host lookups and password lookups.
   * Here is a snippet for options that will work for this tutorial (note simplification):<pre>
#passwd: db files ldap nis
passwd:     files
shadow:     files
group:      files

#hosts:     db files nisplus nis dns
hosts:      files dns</pre>

---++ Accounts creation
Since all hosts in the cluster share the user home directories, the user and group IDs must be consistent. 

<!--Make sure that system (existing) accounts/groups have IDs < 500.

User accounts/groups or accounts/groups used for the OSG grid software (*rsvuser*) will have IDs >= 500.
-->

Host are supposed to have the same accounts and passwords.

To ease consistency accounts and groups are created on one host, e.g. =gc1-ce= and replicated to the other hosts in the cluster.
 
   * Home directories must be mounted. *Please test that shared home directories are mounted correctly! NFS must be working  (see ClusterNFSServer)*
   * Accounts are created with =useradd= utility
   * Accounts to be created:
      * =condor= used by the condor scheduler 
      * =gsuser= (a normal interactive user) 
      * =osgedu= and other accounts, such as the vo group accounts, as needed
   * e.g. you can use the following lines to create the accounts mentioned above:<pre>useradd condor
useradd gsuser
useradd osgedu 
</pre>
<!--   * (optional) By default, the =useradd= utility creates a separate group for each user.  We may want to define two groups:
      * users - for local, interactive user accounts
      * gridvo - for group accounts for grid users from VOs  
   * Creation of ¨addon¨ files extracting groups/accounts with IDs > 500 (to append to other hosts):
      * =group._addon.gc1= 
      * =passwd._addon.gc1=  
      * =shadow._addon.gc1= (note that shadow is write protected)
      * =gshadow._addon.gc1= (note that gshadow is write protected)
   * Push the files to each of the hosts in the cluster, appending them to the corresponding files as appropriate.
   * Check the files manually to verify that they were updated correctly.
-->
   * Replicate the files to the other machines (as root):
      * on the host (=gc1-ce=) where you created the user accounts:<pre>
mkdir /home/rootshared
cd /etc/
cp passwd group shadow gshadow /home/rootshared
</pre>
      * on all the other machines (=gc1-nfs=, =gc1-se=, ...) as root:<pre>
cd /home/rootshared
cp passwd group shadow gshadow /etc/
chmod 400 /etc/shadow /etc/gshadow
</pre>
      * once you are done replicating the accounts on all the machines, remove the directory used for sharing:<pre>
rm -rf /home/rootshared
</pre>
