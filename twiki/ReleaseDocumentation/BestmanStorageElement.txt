---++ Introduction
 Berkeley Storage Manager ([[http://sdm.lbl.gov/bestman][BeStMan]]) is a full implementation of SRM v2.2, developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, for a disk based storage and mass storage systems such as HPSS. End users may have their own personal BeStMan that manages and gives an SRM interface to their own local disks. It works on top of existing disk-based unix file systems, and has been reported so far to work on file systems such as NFS, GPFS, PVFS, GFS, Ibrix, HFS+, Hadoop, !XrootdFS and Lustre. It also works with any existing file transfer service, such as gsiftp, http, https, bbftp and ftp. It requires minimal administrative efforts on the deployment and updates. If storage is hierarchical and/or spans multiple file system types and storage systems, [[ReleaseDocumentation.DCacheInstall][SRM/dCache]] should be considered. 


See also [[ReleaseDocumentation.BeStMan][BeStMan-fullmode]] documentation for more information about full mode installation,   [[ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGateway][BeStMan-gateway]] Guide for gateway mode, and  [[ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGatewayXrootd][BeStManGateway-Xrootd]]  Guide for  gateway mode installation on top of Xrootd DFS.

---++ Architecture 
 In this example, !BeStMan is installed over Xrootd.
!Storage.BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd storage consists of the following components: 
   *  FUSE -   [[http://fuse.sourceforge.net File System in User Space]] is required for !XrootdFS 
   * !XrootdFS -  is a Posix filesystem for an Xrootd storage cluster ([[http://wt2.slac.stanford.edu/xrootdfs/xrootdfs.html XrootdFS Home Page]] ), is required for !Storage.BeStMan, !GridFTP to work with  Xrootd  
   * !Storage.BeStMan-gateway is a partial implementation of SRM v2.2, developed by LBNL, for disk based storage systems maintenance ( [[http://sdm.lbl.gov/bestman Storage.BeStMan HomePage]] ) 
   * !GridFTP server  provides a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer ( [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/gridftp GrdiFTP Documentation]] ) 
   * Xrootd   provides POSIX-like access to files and their enclosing directory namespace ( [[http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/papers/Scalla-Intro.htm Xrootd Home Page]] )
