%TOC%

---++ About This Document
This document describes the notification process and shows examples for updating the VDT/OSG software.

---++ Applying updates
There are frequent updates to the grid software for security and functional improvements, just like any other software.  When updates are announced they will tell you how severe the patch is and how quickly you should apply it. We highly recommend installing all updates when they are announced. It is ultimately your decision as the site admin when to apply a patch, but anything longer than a few days delay should have a good reason.

---++ Urgent update example

Here is an example of an urgent update announcement message:

The notice above is for a security update to the Glexec software and should be considered urgent for sites running Glexec. If a site is not running Glexec then it is not urgent.  If you are not sure if you run a specific component there are a few things you can do. Use the command

<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% vdt-control --list</pre>

This will give you a list of running grid services. Or Go to [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/documentation.html][VDT Documentation]] web site to find out which components are included in a particular version.

---++ Optional update example

Another example notice is shown below, which is a more general software update but includes a security update for Java.  Most sites use Java in one form or another and so it should be considered important for all sites.  But since it was not identified specifically as a Security Update it is not critical for security purposes. However, it may be critical for proper functioning of your services.
