---++ Intro
This document is now deprecated since it describes how to change the frequency of services which 
themselves are all deprecated.

Describes recommended best practices for OSG site monitoring and metrics. From [[Main.StevenTimm][StevenTimm's]] talk on [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=455][Lessons Learned & Best Practices]].

---++ Monitoring Packages in the OSG
There are four major monitoring packages in OSG 0.4.1:
   * *<nop>MonALISA*
   * *MIS-­CI*: feeds GridCat, did feed ACDC dashboard)
   * *<nop>CEMon*: executes the Generic Information Provider
   * *GRIS*:  executes Generic Information provider

In OSG 0.6.0, GRIS is deprecated and CEMON is used for all delivery of stuff from the information providers.
MIS-CI is also removed.  So there are only two.

Frequencies of all monitoring software in the OSG are adjustable. See documentation for more information. Going slower than the default frequency is essential to a smooth operation.  Testing has found that a five minute frequency both
for sending information to collectors and executing the Generic Information Providers is about right for CEMon.
These frequencies are set in $VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc/glite-ce-monitor/cemonitor-config.xml and are set
in units of 1000th's of a second..i.e. the default frequency 300000 means 300 seconds or 5 minutes.

The more things that are calling =condor_q=, the more potential for trouble.

Recent report suggests that grep can be faster if <tt>LOCALE=C</tt> rather than =US-­ENGLISH=
In VDT 1.6.1/OSG 0.6.0  this has now been added to the default Generic Information Provider script.

If a VO is listed in =grid3-­user-­vo-­map.txt=, your site needs to support it. =grid3-­user-­vo-­map.txt= has to be right before the Generic Information provider (GIP) is configured.
VDT.1.6.1/OSG 0.6.0 the file is renamed to osg-user-vo-map.txt and consistency checks are made to make 
sure that the users and VO's that you have in your user-vo map actually exist, and the GIP is reconfigured
automatically when new VO's are added.

Be sure Generic Information Provider (GIP) advertises the right number of job slots. Otherwise, it's a &#8220;kick me&#8221; sign to the LCG.

%ENDInsetBox%

CEMon is new. We have been running it at FNAL under OSG 0.4.1.  It can be memory­-hungry.

Do we have to split some monitoring off to another node? Maybe eventually, especially with advent of web services. 

Monitoring should use =condor_q ­-format= and =condor_status ­-format=.
