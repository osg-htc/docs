#DocumentTypes
---+++ Document Types and Templates
Documents can be of several different types.  Types are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_TYPE.  The Templates are recommended formatting and sections to be included in the associated document type.
| *Document Type* | *Definition* | *Template* |
| !HowTo | Documents telling how to do something. Other document types exist for specific procedures. (For example, see Installation and Troubleshooting.)| DocHowToTemplate |
| Installation | Documents describing the procedure for installation of software | DocInstallTemplate |
| Knowledge | Documents of a general nature and not of another type.  (For example, general information, explanations, descriptions, and theoretical aspects of grid computing.) | DocBasicTemplate |
| Navigation | Documents supporting a person in navigating to other documents or the TWiki itself. | DocBasicTemplate |
| Planning | Documents supporting the planning of grid computing.  (For example, Planning an OSG site.) | DocBasicTemplate |
| Training | Documents designed for training or used organize or manage a training event. | DocBasicTemplate |
| Troubleshooting | Documents that support the resolution of typical problems that can to occur. | ReleaseDocumentation.DocTroubleshootingTemplate |

---+++ Document User Roles
Each document is written for a person in a certain role (called primary role).  It may also be used by people in another role (called the secondary role).  Since few documents cover multiple roles, we do not specify a secondary role in a document.  Roles are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_ROLE.
| *Document Reader Role* | *Definition* |
| Developer | Software developers of grid applications |
| Documenter | Any person working on documentation itself |
| Scientist | A person submitting jobs to the Grid -- an "End User" |
| Student | Any student, who is learning about any part of OSG.  General training material might be for this role.  Specific training written for another role would be classified as that role as primary. |
| !SysAdmin | A computer system administrator, managing a computing resource in OSG |
| VOManager | A manager in a %LINK_GLOSSARY_VO% as contrasted with one of the above roles |

---+++ Document Areas
The documentation universe is segmented into a set of areas, each of which has an owner having overall responsibility for the documentation of that area.  The Areas are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_AREA.
| *Documentation Area* | *Definition* | *Area Owner* |
| !ComputeElement | Documents describing the installation, operation or usage of a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% | Main.IwonaSakrejda |
| General | General documents and documents about [[Documentation.DocumentationTeam.WebHome][documentation]] itself | Main.RobertEngel |
| Integration | Documents describing the integration and test of software into a package for the %LINK_OSG%. | Main.SuchandraThapa |
