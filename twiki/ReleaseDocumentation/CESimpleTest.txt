---+ Authentication Test

The purpose of your [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateWhatIs][grid certificate]] is to authenticate yourself with every service provided by a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%. The authentication process is based on the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509][X.509 Public Key Infrastructure]] which consists of a private key (=userkey.pem=) and a public key (=usercert.pem=). Both files together form your _certificate_ and are by default located in =$HOME/.globus=:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% ls -al $HOME/.globus
total 68
drwxr-x---  4 %UCL_USER% %UCL_USER%  4096 Mar 18 18:50 .
drwx------ 29 %UCL_USER% %UCL_USER% 12288 Jul 28 08:38 ..

-r--------  1 %UCL_USER% %UCL_USER%  1919 Dec 16  2008 userkey.pem
</pre>

Your certificate can be used to create a limited life-time %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRID_PROXY% or a %LINK_GLOSSARY_VOMS_PROXY%. You should use a VOMS Proxy if your membership %LINK_GLOSSARY_VO% supports VOMS Proxies and is providing a VOMS Server. Some OSG sites may require the use of a VOMS Proxy and will reject authentication requests using Grid Proxies.

%NOTE% If uncertain please contact the *VO Manager* for your membership *VO*.

---%SHIFT%++ Authentication using a Grid Proxy

To display detailed information about your grid proxy =grid-proxy-info= can be used:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% grid-proxy-info

</pre>

_Identity_ is sometimes also referred to as _Grid Identity_ or more frequently as %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN%. The last line of the output above indicates how long your current grid proxy will be valid. A grid proxy is said to have _expired_ if there is not time left on it. To _renew_  your grid proxy the program =grid-proxy-init= is used together with your grid password:

<pre class="screen">

---%SHIFT%++ Authentication using a VOMS Proxy

To display detailed information about your voms proxy =voms-proxy-info= can be used:

<pre class="screen">

_Identity_ is sometimes also referred to as _Grid Identity_ or more frequently as %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN%. Note the display of the %RED%extended attributes%ENDCOLOR% The first line marked =timeleft= of the output above indicates how long your current voms proxy will be valid. A voms proxy is said to have _expired_ if there is not time left on it. To _renew_  your voms proxy the program =voms-proxy-init= is used together with your grid password:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-init %RED%-voms LIGO:/LIGO%ENDCOLOR% -valid 500:00

%NOTE% The command line option =%RED%-voms LIGO:/LIGO%ENDCOLOR%= tells =voms-proxy-init= to contact the VOMS server for the LIGO VO. This may be different for your VO. Locate a file named =vomses= on your submission host to find out more about available VOMS servers. 
%ENDSECTION{"AuthenticationTest"}%

%STARTSECTION{"MappingTest"}%
---%SHIFT%++ Mapping Test

A valid grid proxy does not guarantee that you may successfully authenticate with a remote grid resource. For a successful authentication your %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN% must be _mapped_ on the remote resource. A simple and quick way to check if your *DN* is mapped is to use =globus-run=:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globusrun -a -r %UCL_CE%

GRAM Authentication test successful
</pre>

%NOTE% This example requires the _Grid Resource Allocation Manager (%LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%)_ to be available on the resource. This is usually the case on a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%, but not on a  %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE%. If you want to test authentication with a Storage Element, use the next example instead.
%ENDSECTION{"MappingTest"}%


---+ Data Transfer Test

Data can be transferred to and from a grid resource using a version of ftp that supports grid authentication called %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP%. The =globus-url-copy= command can be used for that purpose.

To verify that !GridFTP is working correctly we will 

   1 create a file using =dd=
   1 transfer the file _to_ the grid resource using =globus-url-copy=
   1 transfer the file back _from_ the grid resource using =globus-url-copy=
   1 compare both files using =diff=

First let's create the test file:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/%UCL_CE%.test.0 bs=1k count=1024
1024+0 records in
1024+0 records out
1048576 bytes (1.0 MB) copied, 0.005332 seconds, 197 MB/s
</pre>

Next let's transfer the file to the grid resource:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-url-copy file:///tmp/%UCL_CE%.test.0 gsiftp://%UCL_CE%/~/%UCL_CE%.test.0
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
0
</pre>

To copy the file back to your resource use:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-url-copy gsiftp://%UCL_CE%/~/%UCL_CE%.test.0 file:///tmp/%UCL_CE%.test.1
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
0
</pre>

Finally let's compare the _original_ with the _copy_ received back from the remote resource:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% diff /tmp/%UCL_CE%.test.0  /tmp/%UCL_CE%.test.1
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
0
</pre>

%NOTE% The =file= protocol in the *URI* is used for files on a local file system. In this case no authentication is performed with the local resource before the file is read or written. Replacing =file= by =gsiftp= always requires a %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP% server running at the resource specified in the URI.

 
---+ Job Submission Test

---++ Job Submission using GRAM

The <b>G</b>rid <b>R</b>esource <b>A</b>llocation <b>M</b>anager (%LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%) is a service running on a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% that services your job submission request and which puts your job into execution after successful authentication.

Here we use the =globus-job-run= command to execute the =id= command on the remote resource using the default *fork* %LINK_GLOSSARY_JM%:
 
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE% /usr/bin/id
uid=506(ligo) gid=506(ligo) groups=506(ligo)
</pre>

Upon success =/usr/bin/id= returns information about the user account which has been used to execute the program itself on the grid resource. This is the account that your %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN% is mapped to. Unlike the [[ReleaseDocumentation/CESimpleTest#Mapping_Test][Mapping Test]] this test also verifies that the account exists and that the job manager was able to run the command on your behalf on the compute element.

%NOTE% Please open a ticket with the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET% for the resource in case the command did not succeed.

---+++ Test the Availability of a Job Manager

A %LINK_GLOSSARY_JM% is a process running on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% which is managing the execution of your job. By default the job manager =fork= will be used to _fork_ your program directly on the compute element. As a general rule of thumb you should %RED%avoid to use fork%ENDCOLOR% and to execute programs on the compute element unless that is your intention. A not complete list of job managers includes =fork=, =managedfork=, =ccs=, =condor=, =lsf=, =pbs= and =sge=. Depending on the setup of the grid resource more than one job manager may be supported.

Just like in the previous example we can use =globus-job-run= to verify that the =fork= job manager is available and used for the execution:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE%/jobmanager-fork /usr/bin/id
uid=506(ligo) gid=506(ligo) groups=506(ligo)
</pre>

Notice how we append =/jobmanager-fork= to the grid resource to explicitly request it. This can be used to detect if a certain job managers such as =condor= is available:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE%/jobmanager-condor /bin/hostname
dom118
</pre>

Because the job is scheduled to be executed through %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% this command will likely require more time to complete. Here we used the =/bin/hostname= command to return the _hostname_ of the worker node executing the job.

To specify a job manager that is not supported by the grid resource creates a convenient way to find out what job managers are supported by the resource from the comfort of the command line:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE%/jobmanager-pbs /bin/hostname
GRAM Job submission failed because the gatekeeper failed to find the requested service (error code 93)
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
93
</pre>

%NOTE% The <b>names for job managers are case sensitive</b> and are <b>all lower case for %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%</b>.

---+ Troubleshooting

%ICON{hand}% The following sections provide a _step-by-step guide_ helping you to determine the approximate cause of an error that has occurred. Knowing the approximate cause of an error will allow you to write more _meaningful error reports_ when opening a ticket with the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET%. 

---++ !GridFTP

Several causes can make the [[ReleaseDocumentation/CESimpleTest#Data_Transfer_Test][Data Transfer Test]] fail:

   1 the !GridFTP daemon is not answering on the default port =2811= or the remote resource is down
   1 the directory on the !GridFTP server you want to access does not exist
   1 the directory on the !GridFTP server you want to write into is mounted read-only
   1 your Distinguished Name is mapped to an account that has not sufficient privileges to access a given directory on the !GridFTP server

%NOTE% We assume that you successfully completed the [[ReleaseDocumentation/CESimpleTest#Mapping_Test][Mapping Test]] before you proceed!

---+++ Test if the !GridFTP service is answering on the default port 2811

The =telnet= program can be used to connect to the default !GridFTP port =2811= on the server side to check if the GridFTP server will answer:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% telnet %UCL_CE% 2811
Trying 131.215.114.48...
%RED%Connected to %UCL_CE% (131.215.114.48)%ENDCOLOR%.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 %UCL_CE% GridFTP Server 2.8 (gcc64dbg, 1217607445-63) [VDT patched 4.0.8] ready.
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>

!GridFTP is available if you received a '%RED%Connected to ...%ENDCOLOR%' message. Otherwise you may want to contact the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET% and open a ticket for the resource!

---+++ Test if the target directory on the !GridFTP server exists

A convenient way to check for the existence of the target directory on the !GridFTP server is to use =globus-job-run= to list its content:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE% /bin/bash -c "ls -al ~"
total 17632
drwxr-xr-x 18 ligo ligo    69632 Jun 14 18:40 .
drwxr-xr-x 43 root root     4096 Jun  8 14:06 ..

drwx------  4 ligo ligo     4096 Dec  7  2009 .globus
-rw-rw-r--  1 ligo ligo       36 Mar 17 20:55 .gnuplot_history
-rw-------  1 ligo ligo       42 May 28 12:22 .lesshst
drwxrwxr-x  3 ligo ligo     4096 Aug 22  2009 .mc
drwx------  2 ligo ligo     4096 Apr 22 15:10 .ssh
drwx------  3 ligo ligo     4096 Jun 13  2009 .subversion
-rwxr-xr-x  1 ligo ligo    10582 Jun  8 10:11 .viminfo
-rw-r--r--  1 ligo ligo  1048576 Jun 14 18:13 %UCL_CE%.test.0
</pre>

If the directory is not available you may _try_ to create it using =globus-job-run=:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE% /bin/bash -c "mkdir -p /tmp/example"
%UCL_PROMPT% echo $?
0
</pre>

If you are certain that the directory should exist on the server, you may want to contact the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET% and open a ticket for the resource!

---+++ Test that the target directory on the !GridFTP server is not mounted read-only

It is relatively common that directories are mounted _read-only_. You can test if that is the case by using the =mount= command:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE%/jobmanager-fork /bin/bash -c "/bin/mount"
/dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol00 on / type ext3 (rw)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
/dev/xvda1 on /boot type ext3 (rw)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
none on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc (rw)
sunrpc on /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs type rpc_pipefs (rw)
10.10.1.2:/home on /home type nfs (rw,addr=10.10.1.2)
fuse on /mnt/hadoop type fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions)
</pre>

%NOTE% This test will only return a meaningful result for partitions that are %GREEN%mounted%ENDCOLOR% on the Compute Element. It will not report partitions that are %RED%automounted%ENDCOLOR%. Replace the job manager =fork= with another job manager like =condor= to execute the same test on a worker node in this case.

If you are certain that the directory should be mounted or be mounted with _write permissions_, you may want to contact the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET% to open a ticket for the resource!

---+++ Test if your DN is mapped to an account with sufficient privileges

Please compare the result of the =id= program on the !GridFTP server side:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE% /bin/bash -c "id"
uid=506(ligo) gid=506(ligo) groups=506(ligo)
</pre>

with the ownership and group membership information of the target directory on the !GridFTP server ( [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/CESimpleTest#Test_if_the_target_directory_on][see here]] ).

If you are certain that the directory should be mounted or be mounted with write-access, you may want to contact the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET% to open a ticket for the resource!

---++ GRAM

Several causes can make the [[ReleaseDocumentation/CESimpleTest#Job_Submission_Test][Job Submission Test]] fail:

   1 the %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM% daemon is not answering on the default port =2911= or the remote resource is down
   1 your %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN% is mapped to a unix account that does not exist
   1 you are trying to access a %LINK_GLOSSARY_JM% that is not supported by the grid resource

%NOTE% We assume that you successfully completed the [[ReleaseDocumentation/CESimpleTest#Mapping_Test][Mapping Test]] before you proceed!

---+++ Test that the GRAM service is answering on the default port 2911

Here we will use =telnet= to connect to the default GRAM port =2911= on the server side:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% telnet %UCL_CE% 2119
Trying 131.215.114.48...
%RED%Connected to %UCL_CE% (131.215.114.48).%ENDCOLOR%
Escape character is '^]'.
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>

GRAM is running if you receive a '%RED%Connected to ...%ENDCOLOR%' message. Otherwise you may want to contact the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET% to open a ticket for the resource.

---+++ Test if your Distinguished Name is mapped to an existing unix account

If you can successfully authenticate with a resource, but the local system administrator didn't create the account your %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN% is mapped to, you will receive an error. In this case the [[ReleaseDocumentation/CESimpleTest#Mapping_Test][Mapping Test]] will succeed, but the jobmanager will report that it %RED%failed to put the job into execution%ENDCOLOR% during the [[ReleaseDocumentation/CESimpleTest#Job_Submission_Test][Job Submission Test]]. Please open a ticket with the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET%.

---+++ Test if a particular Job Manager is supported

By default the =fork= %LINK_GLOSSARY_JM% is used to execute your command on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%. To test if a particular job manager is supported by the resource, try to submit the =id= command to that job manager:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_CE%:2119/jobmanager-pbs /bin/bash -c "id"
GRAM Job submission failed because the gatekeeper failed to find the requested service (error code 93)
</pre>

%NOTE% The list of known jobmanagers supported by %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM% includes =fork=, =managedfork=, =condor=, =sge=, =pbs=, =lsf=, =ccs=. The spelling is _case-sensitive_ and differs slightly for %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM_WS%: =Fork=, =ManagedFork=, =Condor=, =SGE=, =PBS=, =LSF=, =CCS=! It is also called a %LINK_GLOSSARY_FT% by GRAM-WS.

Please open a ticket with the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET% if you are certain that the job manager name you provided should be supported by the resource.

---+++ Does Condor-G fail when Globus commmands succeed?

Sometimes Condor-G will fail even when the simple Globus commands succeed.  This is because Condor-G exercises the GRAM protocol more than most =globus-job-run= invocations. In particular, it requires that more client network ports be open.  Condor-G will listen for incoming connections on the client coming from the CE (so, the Condor-G client acts like a server to some extent).  If either client or the remote site has a firewall blocking these ports, Condor-G will fail but =globus-job-run= will succeed.

Firewall issues may be difficult to track down. The three possible places where you might run into a firewall are:
   1 On the client Condor-G host.  This is the most common, as many operating systems block incoming connections.  This is discussed below.
   1 On the client's network.  It's common security practice at some universities or sites to lock down incoming connections.  To fix this, you may need to contact your local site security.
   1 On the remote CE host.  This is unlikely, as it's not very common to block outgoing connections on a CE.  

To solve the first problem, you need to punch a hole in the firewall. You need a port range with at least 13 ports per user that might use Condor-G. For example, if you have ten people that might submit jobs via Condor-G, you'll need at least 130 ports in the port range.  Once you have the port range, you need to change the Condor-G client's configuration for the condor_gridmanager component. For example, if the port range is 8000-8129, you would set in your =condor_config=:

<pre>
GRIDMANAGER.IN_LOWPORT = 8000
GRIDMANAGER.IN_HIGHPORT = 8129
</pre>
After changing this configuration, restart Condor-G.

---+ Recommendations on opening a ticket with the GOC

The OSG provides a ticketing system through the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET% (GOC) for addressing issues users have working with production resources. In order to address your issue as quick as possible you should:

   * make sure that the error is not an error on your side
   * consult [[https://myosg.grid.iu.edu/rgdowntime/index?datasource=downtime&downtime_attrs_showpast=&account_type=cumulative_hours&ce_account_type=gip_vo&se_account_type=vo_transfer_volume&bdiitree_type=total_jobs&start_type=7daysago&start_date=06%2F16%2F2010&end_type=now&end_date=06%2F16%2F2010&all_resources=on&facility_10009=on&gridtype=on&gridtype_1=on&service_1=on&service_5=on&service_central_value=0&service_hidden_value=0&active=on&active_value=1&disable_value=1][MyOSG]] to find out if a resource has scheduled maintenance 
   * provide a clear description of the problem
   * if possible include a test and the output you receive, so that an administrator could duplicate the problem

%NOTE% You must import your grid certificate into your browser in order to authenticate yourself with the Grid Operations Center.
