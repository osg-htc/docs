---+!! Service Activation and Deactivation
%TOC%

---+ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for system administrators and users. It describes the procedure to activate and deactivate services provided by an installation of the %LINK_VDT%.

%INCLUDE{"Documentation/DocumentationTeam/DocConventions" section="Header"}%
%INCLUDE{"Documentation/DocumentationTeam/DocConventions" section="CommandLine"}%

%STARTSECTION{"About"}%
---%SHIFT%+ About VDT Services

The %LINK_GLOSSARY_VDT% provides three types of services:

   1 =cron= services that will be started periodically by the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron][cron daemon]]
   1 =init= services that will be started and stopped by the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init][init daemon]]
   1 =xinet= services that will be started upon internet connection attempts by the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinetd][extended internet daemon]]

Only =cron= services may be setup by unprivileged users. All other services require _root_ privileges.  
%ENDSECTION{"About"}%

%STARTSECTION{"List"}%
---%SHIFT%+ List Registered Services

To see a list of services registered by the %LINK_VDT% use =vdt-control=:

<pre class="%UCL_SCREEN%">
%UCL_PROMPT% vdt-control %RED%--list%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>
%ENDSECTION{"List"}%

%STARTINCLUDE%

%STARTSECTION{"EnableService"}%
---%SHIFT%+ Enable Services

Before a service can be [[ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices#Service_Activation][activated]] it needs to be _enabled_. You can [[ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices#List_Registered_Services][list]] the status of registered services to see if a service is enabled or disabled.

To enable a registered service use =vdt-control=:

<pre class="%UCL_SCREEN%">
%UCL_PROMPT% vdt-control %RED%--enable%ENDCOLOR% %UCL_SERVICE%
</pre>
%ENDSECTION{"EnableService"}%


%STARTSECTION{"DisableService"}%
---%SHIFT%+ Disable Services

Disable a service to remove it from the [[ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices#List_Registered_Services][list]] of services that can be [[ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices#Service_Activation][activated]] or [[ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices#Service_Deactivation][deactivated]]

To disable a registered service use =vdt-control=:

<pre class="%UCL_SCREEN%">
%UCL_PROMPT% vdt-control %RED%--disable%ENDCOLOR% %UCL_SERVICE%
</pre>
%ENDSECTION{"DisableService"}%


%STARTSECTION{"Activate"}%
---%SHIFT%+ Service Activation

Use =vdt-control= to _activate_ registered services. This will:

   * add entries to crontab for =cron= services
   * add control scripts to =/etc/init.d= for =init= services
   * start new =init= services
   * configure the xinet daemon for =xinet= services

Unprivileged users must provide the =--non-root= argument to =vdt-control= to install =cron= services. All other services require _root_ privileges.

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control %RED%--on%ENDCOLOR% %UCL_SERVICE%
</pre>

=vdt-control= will _fail_ to activate any service that is already provided by the operating system. In this case you may _force_ the activation of the new service provided by the %LINK_VDT%:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control %RED%--force%ENDCOLOR% --on %UCL_SERVICE%
</pre>

Another reason for =vdt-control= to fail to activate a service may be that the service was previously installed by another installation of the %LINK_VDT% which has not been _deactivated_ yet. In this case you must _force_ the deactivation of the existing service before you continue to install the new service:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control %RED%--force%ENDCOLOR% --off %UCL_SERVICE%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --on %UCL_SERVICE%
</pre>

%ENDSECTION{"Activate"}%

%STARTSECTION{"Deactivate"}%
---%SHIFT%+ Service Deactivation

Use =vdt-control= to _deactivate_ registered services. This will:

   * remove entries from crontab for =cron= services
   * stop =init= services
   * remove control scripts from =/etc/init.d= for =init= services
   * re-configure the xinet daemon for =xinet= services

Unprivileged users must provide the =--non-root= argument to =vdt-control= to uninstall =cron= services. All other services require _root_ privileges.

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control %RED%--off%ENDCOLOR% %UCL_SERVICE%
</pre>

=vdt-control= may fail to deactivate all services due to hanging processes. In this case expect the process table and kill hanging processes manually.
