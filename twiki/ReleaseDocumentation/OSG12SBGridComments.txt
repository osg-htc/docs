---++ Introduction 

We won't be setting up an ITB site this time around, but I do have plans next week to run some tests against the existing ITB sites.

---++ Known issues

Initial test notes:

Was able to successfully auth against the 5 Persistent ITB sites with an SBGrid voms proxy on Jul 15th.

 ISR: I used grid-proxy-init instead of voms-proxy-init, so this may have created problems.

_07/16/2009_

---++++ BNL_ITB_Test1
First run of tests okay.

ISR: Test job that completed inside of 2 minutes on other sites shows 23 minutes running
355277.0   ijstokes        7/23 17:32   0+00:23:17 R  0   0.0  rsync.sh gridtest0

associated gridid: https://gridtest01.racf.bnl.gov:22528/2492/1248384766/

SRM: Couldn't guess the correct SURL: srm://dcsrm.usatlas.bnl.gov:8443/srm/v2/server?SFN=/pnfs/usatlas.bnl.gov/sbgrid

---++++ CIT_ITB_1
The filesystem for $OSG_APP  is Read Only.

ISR: Job held:

018 (355280.000.000) 07/23 17:42:50 Globus job submission failed!
    Reason: 22 the job manager failed to create an internal script argument file
...
012 (355280.000.000) 07/23 17:42:50 Job was held.
    Globus error 22: the job manager failed to create an internal script argument file
    Code 2 Subcode 22

ISR: SRM operations failed -- looks like my guess of the SURL is wrong: srm://cit-itb-se.ultralight.org:8443/srm/v2/server?SFN=/mnt/hadoop/sbgrid

Cannot create directory:

SRM-DIR: Thu Jul 23 18:34:30 EDT 2009 Calling SrmMkdir

---++++ FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB

*07/23/2009*
First run of tests okay.

Using my *NEBioGrid* VOMS proxy, authentication fails

ISR: Job that completed in 2 minutes on other nodes still stuck in "R" state after 32 minutes:

355276.0   ijstokes        7/23 17:32   0+00:31:57 R  0   0.0  rsync.sh fgitbgkc2
associated gridid: https://fgitbgkc2.fnal.gov:46024/21030/1248384765/

SRM: Ops work ok, but srm-ls does not show a file copied to destination.

---++++ LBNL_DSD_ITB

I'm getting a "Word too long." error.
$ globus-job-run grolsch.lbl.gov /bin/tcsh -c 'echo $PATH'
Word too long.
Most versions of the tcsh shell have a PATH limit of 4096 characters.  It looks like there are 6124 chars in the PATH at the site.

ISR: Job that completed in 2 minutes on other nodes still stuck in "R" state after 33 minutes:
355279.0   ijstokes        7/23 17:32   0+00:33:46 R  0   0.0  rsync.sh grolsch.l
associated gridid: https://grolsch.lbl.gov:39716/32604/1248384765/

---++++ UC_ITB

*07/23/2009*
First run of tests okay.

Unable to authenticate again.
$ globusrun -a -r uct3-edge7.uchicago.edu
GRAM Authentication test failure: authentication with the remote server failed

%RED% This has been fixed on UC_ITB.  There was an issue with the callout library which prevented authentication from occurring but I've corrected that and have verified that authentication is working correctly at this point -- Suchandra %ENDCOLOR%

07/17/2009, UC_ITB seems to be working okay for me now.  The Job Manager Coverage on the Twiki Validation page seems to say that UC_ITB has PBS and condor job managers, but I think it's just PBS.

ISR: Completed inside of 5 minutes from submission.  In run state for 3 minutes.
gridid: https://uct3-edge7.uchicago.edu:33397/27694/1248384765/

Returned files just fine, directory access OK.

SRM: Access seems OK, but cannot create directory:

SRM-DIR: Thu Jul 23 18:23:52 EDT 2009 Calling SrmMkdir
    status=SRM_INVALID_PATH
    explanation=Error:/bin/mkdir: cannot create directory `/storage/xrootd/sbgrid': No such file or directory
Ref-u sbgrid  /bin/mkdir /storage/xrootd/sbgrid
