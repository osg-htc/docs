%NOTE% This is not a _court document_. We only recommend to use this document as a guide on how to compose good installation documents.

---+!! &lt;A Descriptive Name for the Installation Task&gt;

%GRAY%
   * Please choose a descriptive name that summarizes what the document is about.
   * Example: 'Compute Element Installation Guide' rather than 'CE Install'
%ENDCOLOR%

%TOC{depth="2"}%

%GRAY%
   * Layout the table of contents before you start writing the document if possible.
   * The purpose of the table of contents is to provide a good overview about the installation procedure. The reader should be able to identify major steps by reading the table of contents.
   * The table of contents also provides quick navigation within the document. Please use expressive names for the individual headings that allow readers to determine what a specific section is about.
   * Adjust the =depth= such that overview and navigation are served best.
   * Example: [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall][Compute Element Installation Guide]]
   * All headings start at Level1 "+".
   * The main heading is to be excluded from the table of contents.
%ENDCOLOR%

%GRAY%
%NOTE% The following sections are a super set for all the different sections found in various installation documents. Particular sections may not be helpful for the installation document you are writing and may be excluded.

%NOTE% Some tasks are common for different installation documents. Eventually a topic has been written about elsewhere. In this case please reuse the existing text by _linking to_ or _including sections from_ these documents. A not complete list of examples includes:

   * %LINK_PACMAN%
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices][About VDT Services]]
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementFirewalls][About Firewalls]]
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementLogFiles][About Log Files]]
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/CESimpleTest][About Grid Client Tools]]

%ENDCOLOR%

%ICON{hand}% This document is intended for System Administrators that are installing ...

%GRAY%
   * Include a brief description about this document. Questions that this section should answer are:
   * Who is the target audience for the document (a system administrator, a grid user, a student, ...)?
   * What is the main goal of the document or what will the reader have accomplished when having read it?
   * If applicable, what does the document not accomplish? For instance an installation document for a service does not explain the client tools for it.    
   * If useful, include a brief descriptions of conventions used in the document, like so:
%ENDCOLOR%

%INCLUDE{"Documentation/DocumentationTeam/DocConventions" section="Header"}%
%INCLUDE{"Documentation/DocumentationTeam/DocConventions" section="CommandLine"}%

---+ Applicable Versions (Optional)

%GRAY%
In case the procedure differs significantly for different versions of the OSG or VDT, please include this section.
%ENDCOLOR%

The applicable software versions for this document are %RED%OSG Version >= x.y%ENDCOLOR% and %RED%VDT Version >= a.b%ENDCOLOR%.

---+ Introduction (Optional)

%GRAY%
%NOTE% This section may sometimes be called differently, such as "About Compute Element Services".

This optional section may contain a brief technical description. It may explain what the purpose of the installed software is and when it is needed. It should help the reader make a decision if the content of the document is relevant for him. It may also explain terms being used throughout the document complete with links to the Glossary if possible. See for example  the introduction of the [[ReleaseDocumentation/WorkerNodeClient#What_is_the_Worker_Node_Client_a][Worker Node Client]].

%ENDCOLOR%

---+ Engineering Considerations (Optional)

%GRAY%
Please provide this section if an extensive amount of planning is required before the installation can proceed. This could be installations that require services and/or software to be installed on several machines.
%ENDCOLOR%

---+ How to get Help?

%GRAY%Link the main help page here. List additional sources that could be helpful to the reader!
%ENDCOLOR%

To get assistance please use [[HelpProcedure][this page]]. 

---+ Requirements

%GRAY%
This section serves as a possible early exit point for readers of the document. It must list all requirements that have to be met in order for a typical installation to succeed. All tools mentioned must be linked. All terminologies used should be linked to the Glossary explaining them. For example:
%ENDCOLOR%

   1 verify that your operating system is [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported]].
   1 a %LINK_PACMAN% installation of version %PACMAN_VERSION%.
   1 except for worker node installations a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] is required.
   1 to test and use the installation a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGet][grid user certificate]] is required.
   1 unset the environment variable =$VDT_LOCATION= in case it has previously been set.

---+ Installation Procedure

%GRAY%
This section should contain the entire installation procedure. The configuration of the software should be contained in an own subsection (see below) if it requires a significant amount of work and cannot easily be included in the installation procedure presented here.

The first item should be a numbered list of steps that provide the reader with an overview about the installation process. For example:
%ENDCOLOR%

The installation procedure consists of the following steps:

   1 create an empty installation directory
   1 use %LINK_PACMAN% to install the OSG Client Tools Package
   1 install the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%
   1 configure logfile rotation and automatic updates of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%

%GRAY%
%NOTE% Each step listed in the numbered list above should have its own subsection.

%NOTE% This procedure covers the success legs only. Everything else should be included in the 'Troubleshooting' section at the bottom! 
%ENDCOLOR%

---++ &lt;1st Step of the Installation Procedure&gt;

%GRAY%
Each subsection might start with a brief explanation what the goal of the subsection is. For example:
%ENDCOLOR%

In the next step we will use the =pacman= command line tool to install the package from the OSG software cache. %LINK_PACMAN% will ask whether you want to "trust the caches and accept the license", answer =yall= and =y= to install Compute Element.

%GRAY%
Each step that involves a terminal display should show the commands in a green box for a user terminal and a red box for the root terminal using:

<verbatim><pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% <command> <parameters>
<output>
</pre></verbatim> 

tag which will look like this for a user terminal.
%ENDCOLOR%

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% command parameters
output
</pre>

%GRAY%
%NOTE% Output that is longer than a few lines should be wrapped into the [[ReleaseDocumentation/DocFormattingRules#Command_Line_and_Output][output twisty]].

Standard variables (such as =$VDT_LOCATION=) should be used where they exist. The terminal interaction must be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command line _after_ the prompt!

Please consult the [[ReleaseDocumentation/DocFormattingRules#Presenting_the_Unix_Command_Line][formating rules for the command line]] for more detailed information.
%ENDCOLOR%


---++ &lt;2nd Step of the Installation Procedure&gt;

%GRAY%
Everything above said about the 1st step applies to this section.
%ENDCOLOR%


---+ Configuration Procedure (Optional)

%GRAY%
Non-trivial configuration steps for the software should be presented here. Include an overview of the configuration procedure if the procedure itself is lengthy:
%ENDCOLOR%

In the next step we will configure the service using following steps:

   1 edit this file
   1 open that firewall port
   1 ...

%GRAY%
Steps listed as part of the numbered list above should have their own sub-section inside this section. For example:
%ENDCOLOR%

---++ &lt;1st Step of the Configuration Procedure&gt;

%GRAY%
The procedure may require the reader to edit configuration files. We will use a CSS class named _file_ to render a yellow box around the content ( or parts of it ) of the file:

<verbatim><pre class="file">
Config file line a
Config file line b
</pre></verbatim>

%ENDCOLOR%

<pre class="file">
Config file line a
Config file line b
</pre>

%GRAY%
%NOTE% For more information [[ReleaseDocumentation/DocFormattingRules#Presenting_File_Content][see here]].
%ENDCOLOR%

---++ &lt;2nd Step of the Configuration Procedure&gt;

%GRAY%
Everything said about the 1st step applies to this and every following step.
%ENDCOLOR%


---+ Service Activation and Deactivation (Optional)

%GRAY%
If applicable, this section contains steps required to activate and deactivate the software. Please reuse the material that has been written on the topic here [[ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices][About VDT Services]]. For example like this:

<verbatim>
%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices" section="Activate" TOC_SHIFT="" INPUT_SERVICE="mysql"}%
%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices" section="Deactivate" TOC_SHIFT="" INPUT_SERVICE="mysql"}%
</verbatim>

The =INPUT_SERVICE= variable is optional.

This section may also contain the location of a log file that allows the reader to quickly verify the operation of the service.
%ENDCOLOR%


---+ Validation of Service Operation (Optional)

%GRAY%
Occasionally the steps to validate the success and correct operation of an installation may be _non-trivial_. Please use this _optional_ section to describe how the user can verify the success of the installation.

%NOTE% This section should not become a user guide! Please link to the applicable sections of the user documentation if the service validation requires the reader to execute a user command.
%ENDCOLOR%

---+ Troubleshooting (Optional)

%GRAY%
Please include this section if you can provide useful troubleshooting information here. Use sub sections for each topic you want to address.
%ENDCOLOR%

---++ File Locations

%GRAY%
Locations of configuration files, input/output files, log files, etc. that are important for an administrator to know about if something doesn't work. Please use a table if you have more than 2 files to list.
%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Known Issues

%GRAY%
Restrictions and/or work around for known issues. 
%ENDCOLOR%

---++ &lt;How can I resolve this Problem?&gt;

%GRAY%
Use sub-sections for each problem you want to address in particular. Link to HelpProcedure at the end if the problem could not be resolved.
%ENDCOLOR%


---+ References (Optional)

%GRAY%
References to additional information.  This document should be as concise as possible, but the reader can use these links if he/she wants more background or information. Link related material here, such as the user guide to the software the user was just installing.
%ENDCOLOR%
