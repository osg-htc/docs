---++ About This Document
This document encourages OSG security contacts to get to know their local sites security officers and discusses why this is important.

---++ Know who your institutional cyber security officer is

Most institutions have someone responsible for cyber security at the institution, usually reporting to the CIO (Chief Information Officer) of the institution.  The person responsible may have the title of Cyber Security Officer, or Computer Protection Program Manager, or some other title. They are typically responsible for security of the central IT systems, network security, and security awareness training for the users at that institution.
You should know who that person is. If you don't know who that is, consider the following scenario.

---++ Example scenario

A suspicious process is found running on one of your compute elements.  Doing some initial checks it appears that there may be some additional problems on the machine and a rootkit may be installed.  Who is going to come help investigate? It will likely be someone from the local cyber security officer's team.  They will also likely have the resources and data to determine the extent of the compromise at your site and the risks to the other machines on the network.

You should introduce yourself to the cyber security officer and discuss any institutional requirements for the operation of your grid site. Remember your local security team is always the primary party responsible for the security of your site. They may want to understand what your participation in OSG means. E.g. see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/SecurityRisksCE][Cyber Security Risks of Grid Resources]] If your local team has specific questions, let us know.
