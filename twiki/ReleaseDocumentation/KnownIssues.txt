---++ About this document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for System Administrators. It details the significant known issues in the various versions of the OSG 1.2.x software.


---++ OSG 1.2.18 and earlier
---+++ RSV
When rsv is started or stopped using =vdt-control=, the rsv user must be able to access the current directory otherwise probes will not be able to work correctly.  E.g. if you run =vdt-control --on osg-rsv= in =/root=, the rsv probes will probably fail.   =vdt-control --on osg-rsv= in =$VDT_LOCATION= will succeed however so admins should turn on rsv in that directory.

---++ OSG 1.2.18
---+++ RSV
There is a race condition in RSV that may prevent output from probes from being correctly read in certain instances.  Although this will probably not cause issues with reporting to the GOC, WLCG should not install this release and wait for OSG 1.2.19.

---++ OSG 1.2.17
---+++ RSV
There is an issue with some RSV probes that can result in probes not reporting correctly to the GOC.  This can result in the site status appearing as =Unknown= in the GOC's rsv status and this status being included in the WLCG availability reports.

---++ OSG 1.2.5
---+++ Xrootd 
cnsd log file is not created on startup and  the information is continuing to be dumped into xrootd log file after it was rotated. So, the space utilization on the data server will grow fairly quickly.

The workaround to correct this while a bugfix is implemented is to:
   1 stop xrootd daemons on data server <pre class="screen">
cd <VDT_LOCATION>
. setup.sh
vdt-control -off xrootd
</pre>
   1 Modify configuration file <pre class="screen">
cd $VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/etc
</pre>

   1 edit xrootd.cfg and replace <pre class="screen">
ofs.notify create closew mkdir | ${xrootdlocation}/bin/XrdCnsd -d -l ${xrootdlocation}/var/logs/cnsd.log root://$(xrdr):2094
</pre> with <pre class="screen">
ofs.notify create closew mkdir | ${xrootdlocation}/bin/XrdCnsd -d  root://$(xrdr):2094
</pre>

   1 Restart xrootd deamons <pre class="screen">
vdt-control -on
</pre>
