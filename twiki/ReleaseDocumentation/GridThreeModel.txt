An explanation of the Grid3 storage model.

---++ Grid3 model
%WARNING% This model should not be used for production CEs.

The Grid3 model is the simplest model.  It is intended for a CE that has a few compute nodes that will be used for testing purposes.  This model requires four directories to be visible to the CE  and worker nodes.  These directories are
   * [[StorageParameterOsgGrid][$OSG_GRID]]
   * [[StorageParameterOsgApp][$OSG_APP]]
   * [[StorageParameterOsgData][$OSG_DATA]]
   * [[StorageParameterOsgWnTmp][$OSG_WN_TMP]]

A site admin can point =$OSG_DATA= and =$OSG_WN_TMP= to the same directory and use a single shared disk, but we don't recommend them to do so.  

%WARNING% The Grid3 Model should not be used for production CEs.
