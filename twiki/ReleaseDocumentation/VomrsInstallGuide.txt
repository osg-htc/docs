| Currently in vdt-2.0.0, the voms and vomrs services do not show up in the list&#60;br /&#62;of services when you do vdt-control --list.  We are investigating why that is.  S. Timm&#60;br /&#62; | Main.StevenTimm | 06 Jul 2011 - 18:47 |
| This document currently does not give any information on which certificates are needed, &#60;br /&#62;i.e., host or http, and who they should be readable by, that should be added. | Main.StevenTimm | 06 Jul 2011 - 18:52 |
