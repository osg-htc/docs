---+ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for grid users. It lists environment variables present in a job's environment while it is being executed on a %LINK_GLOSSARY_WN%.

---+ Conventions used in this Document

For variables that are of string type, a  value of =UNAVAILABLE= indicates that the variable is not defined or not applicable. 

---+ Site Related Variables

These are variables that contain information about the site:

---+ Storage Related Variables

The storage related variables are defined in more detail within the [[LocalStorageConfiguration][local storage configuration]] document.  The following is a summary, but the Twiki page should be consulted for a definitive view as well as for an explanation for the use cases and which variables must be defined for each use case.

-->

---+ Job Manager Variables

These variables are a subset of the site variables that relate to the batch job manager used by the site. Several of the variables will be empty for all sites since a site typically only uses a single job manager to manage jobs.

| OSG_CONDOR_LOCATION | String | Installation directory for Condor (typically =OSG_JOB_MANAGER_HOME=) |
| OSG_CONDOR_CONFIG | String | Path of the condor configuration file (typically =OSG_CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config=) |

| OSG_LSF_LOCATION | String | Installation directory for LSF (typically =OSG_JOB_MANAGER_HOME=) |
| OSG_JOB_CONTACT | String | String specifying the endpoint to use within the job submission for reaching the site (e.g. manager.mycluster.edu/jobmanager-pbs ) |
| OSG_UTIL_CONTACT | String | String specifying the endpoint to use to test whether the site is available for debugging or monitoring purposes (e.g. manager.mycluster.edu/jobmanager ) |
| OSG_MANAGEDFORK | Enumerated String [y,n] | Indicates whether ManagedFork is being used.  If this is the case then =OSG_CONDOR_LOCATION= and =OSG_CONDOR_CONFIG= must be set as well regardless of the value of OSG_JOB_MANAGER |

---+ Monitoring Service Variables

---++ !! !MonALISA

These variables are related to the !MonALISA service and the services that it queries.  These are all deprecated and will not work at most sites

%EDITTABLE{  header="|*Variable Name*| *Type*|*Definition*|" format="| text, 20 | text, 15 | textarea, 3x40 |"  changerows="on" quietsave="on" editbutton="Edit table" }%

---+ Squid Service Variables

These variables provide information about the squid proxy that site may make available.

%EDITTABLE{  header="|*Variable Name*| *Type*|*Definition*|" format="| text, 20 | text, 15 | textarea, 3x40 |"  changerows="on" quietsave="on" editbutton="Edit table" }%
| *Variable Name* | *Type* | *Definition* |
| OSG_SQUID_LOCATION | String | The hostname (and optionally port) of the machine that is providing squid proxy services for the site.  This should be set to =UNAVAILABLE= if squid is not provided. E.g. squid.host.name:3128 |
| OSG_SQUID_POLICY | Enumerated String [LRU,LFUDA,GDSF] | The caching policy squid should use for evicting elements from the cache.   *Not currently used* GDSF maximizes the bytes that the proxy caches (i.e. the cache favors large elements over multiple smaller elements) , LFUDA maximizes the number of objects that the proxy caches (i.e. the cache favors multiple smaller elements over large elements), LRU just evicts the least recently used element |
| OSG_SQUID_CACHE_SIZE | integer with optional MB or GB postfixes | The size of the squid disk cache.  The size is assumed to be in megabytes unless a postfix is given. |
| OSG_SQUID_MEM_CACHE | integer with optional MB or GB postfixes | The size of the squid memory cache.  The size is assumed to be in megabytes unless a postfix is given. |

| OSG_GLEXEC_LOCATION | String | The path to the GLEXEC binaries on the worker nodes.  This is set to =UNAVAILABLE= if GLEXEC is not installed. |
| OSG_SYSLOG_NG | Enumerated String [y,n] | Indicates whether the site is using syslog-ng to send logs to the central collector. |
| OSG_CERT_UPDATER | Enumerated String [y,n] | Indicates whether the CA certificate updater is being run from the crontab. If this is not the case, the admin may be using rpm to update the certificates or may be manually updating the CA certificates. |

---+ Legacy Variables

The variables are legacy variables and shadow the corresponding OSG variables.  *Do not use them* for new applications.
