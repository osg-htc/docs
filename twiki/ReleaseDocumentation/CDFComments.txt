Feedback and discussion ongoing, offline via Email.

CDF is also participating in Opportunistic Storage validation.

as of 28-May-08 

CDF glidein's startup at BNL but there are authorization problems on the CDF side
(So we feel that the test is successful enough)

CDF glidein's return no error or log files for the UC (working with UC admin's to solve)

---+++  ITB Validation

This section discusses comments from CDF regarding validation on ITB 0.9.2 for OSG 1.0.

*Status as of March 02, 2009*

We are using the service certificate of SAM for accessing the SE.  Its host/key method is being used for authentication with the storage element. There  exists
problem in accessing all the  ITB SE using the SAM service certificate.  The concerned site admins had been informed.  Following 
are the response from the site admins.

---++ From FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB

The SAM cert is failing because it does not have a VOMS attribute.
All accounts in the CDF VO are required to have a VOMS attribute
to successfully map in GUMS.  I realize that it is impossible
to use a SAM service cert in its intended method, as a host/key
pair, that way.

Comment:  We are using the SAM service certificate for accessing the SE provided by UCSD and Gridka.  It seems that the problem is related to FNAL site.

Got reply from the admin and able to list the folder content in SE using the SAM service certificate.  It is giving 'SRM_AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE "  while creating the folder in the SE.  The site admin has been informed.

Able to list the contents of folder on the FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB SE.  Facing "SRM_AUTHENTICATION FAILURE" while creating new folder on the SRM.  The site admin has been informed.

SE at the UC_ITB site passed the SE  test suites on __20th Mar 2009__.

---++ From BNL_ITB_Test1

The  SE  "srm://grid19.racf.bnl.gov"  don't exist. It is __not feasible to check the SRM operations__ with the available gridftp server only.

---++ From LBNL_DSD_ITB

It is the same problem that we had faced for FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB.  The site admin would have to authorize the SAM service  certificate for accessing the SE.  The error is " connection refused" while accessing its SE.  Following is the subject of the SAM service certificate 

/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=sam/cdfsam15.fnal.gov

*Status as of 11th Mar, 2009*

The SE URL at LBNL_DSD_ITB has been changed.  Site admin suggested us to use another port 60443.  The new URL looks like "srm://osp4.lbl.gov:8443/srm/v2/server?SFN=/srmcache/~/test-file"  .  We are still facing the authentication problem while accessing the concerned SE using the SAM service certificate.  The site admin has been informed and waiting for his response.

*Status as of 19thMar, 2009*

Now facing problem while transferring file from local disk to ITB SRM at LBNL. Error seems to be related to authentication.  Site admin has been been informed.
