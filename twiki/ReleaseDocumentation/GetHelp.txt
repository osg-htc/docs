%NOTE% The following sections are intended to be a super set for an Install Document.  Particular sections may not apply to all documents, but use all the sections that make sense for the installation you are documenting.

%NOTE% Create a new Install document for any version requiring more than a few changes to the procedure.

%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher) and 
%RED%
*vdt-version  a.b*
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher).

---+++!!Engineering Considerations
Include a link to document containing engineering information.
E.g. Needs to be installed on its own server, can be combined with some other service, need to have multiple servers depending on site size, etc.
This can be in-line if it is fairly short -- a couple of paragraphs.

---+++!!Help!
If a problem occurs during installation or verification of the service, see [[#DebugInfo][Debugging Information]].
%BR%
If you cannot resolve the problem, the best way to get help is by following this ReleaseDocumentation.HelpProcedure.

---++ Checklist
An in-line numbered list of items assumed to have been already performed
E.g.:
   1. Installs that must be done before this one
   1. Security environment in place
   1. batch system in place

   1. ports required

A link to document containing information and install steps that only need to be performed if this a first time install.

---++ Installation Procedure
The description of the steps of this Install procedure (including the commands and options required) that will have to be performed each time this is installed.

Each step that requires commands should show the commands in a green box using 
<verbatim><pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre></verbatim> tag which will look like this.
<pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre>
%BR%
%NOTE% Standard variables (such as $VDT_LOCATION) should be used where they exist
%NOTE% The terminal interaction must be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command lines.

This procedure covers the success legs only 

---++ Service Configuration/Startup/Shutdown
Description of the steps (including the commands/options) to startup and shutdown the service.
This often requires, the reader to edit lines in a config file.
If this is necessary, put the lines in a screen box with a yellow background 
(to distinguish from entering commands (green box).
<pre class="file">
Config file line a
Config file line b
</pre>

---++ Validation of Service Operation
Commands to be used to verify the service is working correctly.  This can be combined with the previous section if they are both short.

---+++!!Caveats/Known Issues
