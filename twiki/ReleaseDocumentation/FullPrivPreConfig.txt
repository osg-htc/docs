%ICON{hand}% This document is for System Administrators. It introduces the concept of full privilege authorization using a GUMS server. More information on the topic can also be found [[ReleaseDocumentation/AboutAuthorizationForCE][here]].

---+ Introduction

Grid users are issued grid %LINK_CERTS% used to authorize requests to grid services on sites. The %LINK_OSG% supports two different methods to authorize a request from a grid user:

   1 [[LocalAuthPreConfig][Local Authorization]]
   1 Full Privileged Authorization

In Full Privilege mode,  the PRIMA authorization module with a GUMS service is used for all authorizations and does not use a grid-mapfile. The Globus gatekeeper and WS-GRAM  use a callout to PRIMA such that upon receipt of each request, PRIMA forwards the request to a GUMS service which performs the dynamic mapping of the user's certificate to a local Unix account. 

PRIMA and GUMS can process VOMS FQAN (Fully Qualified Attribute Names), thus enabling mappings based on VO groups and roles as defined in a VOMS server.   This removes the need for maintaining a =grid-mapfile= on each site providing grid services.

%NOTE% All sites on the %LINK_OSG% are encouraged to use full privileged authorization!

---%SHIFT%+ Enable Full Privilege Authorization

The =[Misc Services]= section in the configuration file =%UCL_CWD%/osg/etc/config.ini= defines the authorization method used on the site. To enable full privileged authorization provide the fully qualified domain name of the GUMS server.  To be clear, the PRIMA software
has two different modes of authorization which in the config.ini file are referred to as PRIMA (a SAML-based authorization) and XACML, 
which is an XACML-based authorization message.

The attribute =authorization_method= describes which method to use for authorization:

   * =gridmap= for local authorization
   * =prima= for GUMS version <= 1.2 or 1.3
   * =xacml= for GUMS version >= 1.3  (note xacml is not tested at high rate yet and prima also works just fine with GUMS version 1.3).
