---+ Engineering Considerations

A %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% is a selection of software provided by the %LINK_VDT% bundled for the use on the %LINK_OSG%.  A Compute Element provides services to allow grid users to run jobs on a grid resource. The [[ReleaseDocumentation/SitePlanning][Site Planning Guide]] will help you avoid many of the common problems while installing a new site.

After successfully completing this procedure, you should proceed to install the [[ReleaseDocumentation/WorkerNodeClient][Worker Node Client]].

---+ Requirements
The CE enables a cluster to receive grid jobs but this document supposes that you have a working cluster and are familiar with its management. If this is not the case you may check the [[Trash/Tier3.WebHome][OSG Tier 3 documentation]], a guide more simple for system administrators at their first experiences with clusters and High Throughput Computing. 

   1 new System Administrators should read the [[ReleaseDocumentation/SitePlanning][Site Planning Guide]]
   1 execute all steps to [[ReleaseDocumentation/PreparingComputeElement][prepare your Compute Element]]
   1 verify that your Operating System is [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported]]
   1 a %LINK_PACMAN% installation of version %PACMAN_VERSION% or later
   1 a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] is required
   1 to test and use the installation a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation.CertificateGet][grid user certificate]] is required

---+ How to get Help?

To get assistance please use [[HelpProcedure][this page]]. 

---+ Installation Procedure

The installation procedure consists of the following steps:

   1 deactivate an existing installation
   1 create an installation directory
   1 use %LINK_PACMAN% to install the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%
   1 install the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%
   1 connect %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM% to =managedfork= and your batch system back-end
   1 execute the post installation script

---++ Deactivate an existing Installation (Optional)

Before you proceed you must [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall#Service_Deactivation][deactivate]] an existing installation to avoid to have leftover processes. Make sure to start the installation with a clean environment. If =$VDT_LOCATION= is in your environment you probably need to log-in again and make sure that no setup file is sourced by your log-in script.

---++ Reuse an existing Configuration (Optional)

This [[ReleaseDocumentation/ReusingConfigurationInformation][guide]] describes how to re-use the configuration from an _existing_ installation.

%STARTSECTION{"CreateInstallationDirectory"}%
---%SHIFT%++ Create the Installation Directory

Create an installation directory and change into it. Make sure the directory is world readable if the installation is to be shared by grid users: 

<pre class="rootscreen">
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$ mkdir -p %UCL_CWD%
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$ cd %UCL_CWD%
</pre>

%WARNING% Please do not use a system directory like =/opt= or =/usr= for the installation directory. The installation routine will create many sub-directories in the main directory.
%ENDSECTION{"CreateInstallationDirectory"}%

---++ Use Pacman to Install the Compute Element Software

In the next step we will use the =pacman= command line tool to install the package from the OSG software cache. %LINK_PACMAN% will ask whether you want to "trust the caches and accept the license", answer =yall= and =y= to install Compute Element.

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:ce
Do you want to add [%CACHE%] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): %RED%yall%ENDCOLOR%
...
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:ce
Do you want to add [%CACHE%] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): %RED%yall%ENDCOLOR%
Beginning VDT prerequisite checking script vdt-common/vdt-prereq-check...       

All prerequisite checks are satisfied.
                                                          


========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.

                                                                              
Pacman Installation of OSG-%VERSION% Complete
 </pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

%NOTE% Depending on your network connection and hardware capabilities the installation process will take between 5 and 30 minutes to complete. Meanwhile you can =tail= the main installation logfile =%UCL_CWD%/vdt-install.log=.

%WARNING% Do not continue if the pacman command indicated an error! In this case review the main installation log file and consult the [[ReleaseDocumentation.HelpProcedure][help page]].


%STARTSECTION{"UpdateEnvironment"}%
---%SHIFT%++ Update the Environment

Depending on your shell update your environment by sourcing =%UCL_CWD%/setup.sh= or =%UCL_CWD%/setup.csh=:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% . %UCL_CWD%/setup.sh
</pre>

Depending on your preference you might want to optionally include the setup script in your system or user profile.
%ENDSECTION{"UpdateEnvironment"}%

---++ Connect GRAM to Managed Fork and your Batch System Backend

The Grid Resource Allocation Manager connects to the batch system using a %LINK_GLOSSARY_JM%. By default only the =fork= job manager is supported which allows grid users to execute jobs on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_GATEKEEPER%. To connect %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM% to an _existing_ batch system, you need to install the _corresponding_ job manager.

---+++ Define Globus Port Ranges

%LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP% use *TCP ports* to handle connection requests. The range of TCP ports that will be used by the Compute Element is defined by two environment variables =$GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE= for _outbound_ and =$GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE= for _inbound_ connections respectively.

The range of ports required dependents on the number of _job slots_ your Compute Element provides to grid users. Each job slot in use requires 2 TCP ports within the port range. 

%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementFirewalls" section="VDT_CONFIG"}%

It may be necessary to _limit_ the Linux ephemeral port range to avoid the Globus ports defined above. Please check the =/etc/sysctl.conf= file for the following lines; insert if needed:

<pre class="file">
# Limit ephemeral ports to avoid globus TCP port range
# See OSG CE install guide
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 10240 %RED%&lt;begin port minus 1 port&gt;%ENDCOLOR% 
</pre>

Execute =sysctl= as the _root_ user for these settings to take effect:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% sysctl -p
</pre>

%WARNING% An insufficient range of TCP ports reserved will make grid jobs hang randomly! Do not set the port ranges by editing the =xinetd= configuration files!

%NOTE% Please proceed to configure your [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementFirewalls][firewall]] accordingly.

---+++ Instructions for Managed Fork

The default job manager =fork= allows grid users to run arbitrary many jobs on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_GATEKEEPER%. This may result in dangerous load values which will render the Gatekeeper unusable eventually. The =managedfork= job manager routes incoming =fork= requests through Condor instead, which can be used to restrict the number of jobs executing on the Gatekeeper.

Before you proceed to install the =managedfork= job manager, you may define two environment variables that point to an _existing_ Condor installation and its configuration file. Otherwise _skip_ this step:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION = &lt;Path to Condor&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG   = &lt;Path to Condor configuration file&gt;
</pre>

Then continue to use =pacman= to install the =managedfork= job manager:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:ManagedFork
</pre>

By default =managedfork= does not restrict the execution of jobs _forked_ on the gatekeeper. Restrictions can be defined using the Condor configuration file =$CONDOR_CONFIG=:

<pre class="file">
START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = TotalLocalJobsRunning < %RED%5%ENDCOLOR% || GridMonitorJob =?= TRUE
</pre>

%NOTE% Match =TotalLocalJobsRunning= to the capabilities of your gatekeeper. You must execute =condor_reconfig= as _root_ for the changes to take effect.


%AH_CONDOR_BEGIN%---+++ Instructions for Condor

Before you proceed to install the Condor job manager, you must define two environment variables that point to the _existing_ Condor installation and its configuration file:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION = &lt;Path to Condor&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG   = &lt;Path to Condor configuration file&gt;
</pre>

Then continue to use =pacman= to install the Condor job manager:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-Condor-Setup
</pre>

By default the Condor job manager requires all jobs to be run on a %LINK_GLOSSARY_WN% of the _same_ architecture as the %LINK_GLOSSARY_GATEKEEPER% architecture. Disable this feature if some or all worker nodes use a different architecture by commenting out following line in the file =%UCL_CWD%/globus/lib/perl/Globus/GRAM/JobManager/condor.pm=:

<pre class="file">
#    $requirements .= " && Arch == \"" . $description->condor_arch() . "\" ";
</pre>

Next, optimize Gratia probe performance by changing the directory to record the job history. The location can be changed in the file =$VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG= using the variable *PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR*:

<pre class="file">
PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR = %UCL_CWD%/gratia/var/data
</pre>

Finalize the changes by running =condor_reconfig=:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% condor_reconfig
</pre>

%AH_CONDOR_END%

%AH_PBS_BEGIN%---+++ Instructions for PBS

Before you proceed make sure that the =$PATH= environment variable contains the path to the binaries for the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System][Portable Batch System]]. Then use =pacman= to install the PBS job manager:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-PBS-Setup
</pre>

Otherwise the installation will silently fail and the error will be reported to =%UCL_CWD%/vdt-install.log= only. In this case you must _remove_ the =Globus-PBS-Setup= package, correct the =$PATH= environment variable and install the PBS job manager once again. To remove the =Globus-PBS-Setup= use:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -remove %CACHE%:Globus-PBS-Setup
</pre>

%AH_PBS_END%

%AH_SGE_BEGIN%---+++ Instructions for SGE

Before you proceed make sure that the =$PATH= environment variable contains the path to the binaries for the [[http://gridengine.sunsource.net/][SUN Grid Engine]]. Then use =pacman= to install the SGE job manager:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-SGE-Setup
</pre>

%AH_SGE_END%

%AH_LSF_BEGIN%---+++ Instructions for LSF

Before you proceed make sure that the =$PATH= environment variable contains the path to the binaries for the [[http://www.platform.com/workload-management/high-performance-computing][Platform LSF]]. Then use =pacman= to install the LSF job manager:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-LSF-Setup
</pre>

%AH_LSF_END%

---++ Enable Log-file Rotation (Optional)

Optionally enable the rotation of all log-files using =vdt-control=:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --enable vdt-rotate-logs
</pre>

---++ Post-Install Procedure

To finalize your installation you must run the =vdt-post-install= program on the command line:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-post-install
Starting...
Configuring PRIMA... Done.
Configuring EDG-Make-Gridmap... Done.
Configuring PRIMA-GT4... Done.
Done.
</pre>

---+ Register the Compute Element with the Grid Operations Center

Every _new_ Compute Element should be registered with the %LINK_GOC_OPEN_TICKET% using [[Documentation/RegisterWithOsg][these instructions]]. 

---+ Verify the Operation of the Compute Element

Follow [[ReleaseDocumentation/CESimpleTest][these instructions]] to verify the correct operation of the Compute Element.

---++ !ManagedFork

To verify the correct operation of the =managedfork= jobmanager submit a simple grid job to your gatekeeper (%UCL_HOST_FQDN%). This operation requires a _valid_ grid proxy:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_HOST_FQDN%:2119/jobmanager-fork /bin/sleep 900
</pre>

Next log into your gatekeeper (%UCL_HOST_FQDN%) while the job is running and query Condor for a list of a jobs using =managedfork= as their jobmanager:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_q -constraint 'JobUniverse==12'
2784794.0   fnalgrid       10/7  22:19   0+00:00:11 R  0   0.0  sleep 900 
</pre>

The jobmanager =managedfork= may not work correctly if you don't see the test job among the list of jobs printed to the terminal.

---+ *Comments*
| If the OLD_VDT_LOCATION is set there is no need to run the cert updater by hand, the certs will be handled same way as they were in the old install. I am not sure whether that happens always, but always for me.<br />Also seems to me that the Enabling Full Privilege Authentication is done automatically based on config.ini and the files are placed where they need to be - nothing to be done for it these days.<br /> | Main.IwonaSakrejda | 23 Jul 2009 - 20:54 |
| If Condor has been installed via RPM what should VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION be? Or, better, how do I point the condor-jobmanager to it? | Main.MarcoMambelli | 26 May 2010 - 23:44 |
| Above, in the multi-ce section it says: %BR%Set the value of site_name in the &#34;Site Information&#34; section to be the same for each CE.%BR%Shouldn't that be resource_group setting to be the same now, and resource (only used by gratia) to be different for each (localhost); | Main.StevenTimm | 30 Aug 2010 - 17:57 |
| Marco--if condor has been installed via the old-style RPM, then VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION should be set to the top level, i.e. /opt/condor-7.4.3&#60;br /&#62;in the case of condor-7.4.3.. this is for old style condor rpms up to and including condor 7.4.x.&#60;br /&#62;You can also make a version-neutral symlink, i.e  ln -s /opt/condor-7.4.3 /opt/condor&#60;br /&#62;and then set it to that, this allows you to upgrade condor rpms without changing your vdt install&#60;br /&#62;Condor 7.5 and greater rpms will be put in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin. | Main.StevenTimm | 08 Oct 2010 - 02:23 |
| RE: latitude and longitude--myosg has a plugin by which you can modify the latitude and&#60;br /&#62;longitude of your cluster with a on-screen google map, docs should reflect that. | Main.StevenTimm | 08 Oct 2010 - 02:33 |
| re: PBS instructions--the pbs binaries qstat, qsub, and pbsnodes have to be available&#60;br /&#62;in the PATH all the time, not just at install time, because the Generic Information Provider&#60;br /&#62;routines for PBS assumes that they are in the PATH. | Main.StevenTimm | 08 Oct 2010 - 02:35 |
