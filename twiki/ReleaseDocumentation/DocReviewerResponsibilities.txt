All documents in the official OSG Documentation TWiki have a Reviewer during their creation or update process.
%BR%%BR%
The reviewer of a document should have knowledge about standards and format for the type of document being reviewed and is responsible for:
   1. Performing a review (when the [[Documentation.DocForOwners][Owner]] marks the document as REVIEW_READY and REVIEW_PASSED is IN_PROGRESS) and correcting or noting issues (via email or the document Comment block) for the Owner.  The review should verify that the document:
      a. Contains the relevant sections specified in the template for the relevant document type.  See [[Documentation.DocClassifications#Document_Types_and_Templates][Document Types and Templates]]. %RED%Only applies if a template is provided.%ENDCOLOR%
      a. Sections and content conform to the formatting standards for the relevant document type.  See DocFormattingRules.
      a. Is clearly written and can be understood by a reader with a suitable level of expertise.
      a. Has or refers to a diagram of the appropriate architecture (if applicable).
      a. Is technically accurate and complete (the Reviewer is not responsible for actually testing a procedure).
      a. Contains no typos or wording errors.
   1. Updating the [[Documentation.DocManagementVariables#Document_Reviewer_Variables][REVIEW_PASSED variable]] in the HTML block at the end of the document.  Do this by editing the document using the Edit link at the bottom of the page.
   1. Working in collaboration with the Owner to ensure the issues you identify are resolved in the document.
   1. Doing a final review when you, the [[Documentation.DocForTesters][Tester]], and the Owner agree it is complete and updating the REVIEW_PASSED variable.
   1. Notifying the Document Architect if unable to continue to fulfill the responsibilities of the Reviewer.
