%ICON{hand}% This document is for System Administrators. It describes how to make sure that a site's squid server is working properly.

---+ Introduction

A squid server can cache input data locally at a site which are downloaded by user jobs, which will make subsequent downloads of the same data much faster. The installation instructions can be found at the SquidInstallation page.

---+ Requirements

Prerequisite: Make sure squid is installed and the =OSG_SQUID_LOCATION= attribute is set in the osg-attributes.conf file. Otherwise run =configure-osg= to update the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/bin/osg-attributes.conf= file with the =OSG_SQUID_LOCATION= attribute.

---+ Validation Steps

To make sure the server is working:
   * Set =http_proxy= environment variable to =proxyhost:3128= (where proxyhost is the name of your squid server) and export it
   * Use wget with debugging to get a cachable web url, for example
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% wget -d -O/dev/null http://www.fnal.gov
</pre>
   * The first time you run it you should see not far from the end of the output a line beginning ="X-Cache: MISS"=
   * Run the same command again and you should instead see a line beginning ="X-Cache: HIT"=

To verify that it is working properly from a worker node:
   * run a grid job on the worker node (such as with globus-job-run or condor_submit) with the following commands in it:
      * =uname -a=
      * =export http_proxy=$OSG_SQUID_LOCATION=
      * run the above =wget= command twice
   * Verify that the job ran on a worker node and that ="X-Cache: HIT"= is present in the output from the second =wget=
