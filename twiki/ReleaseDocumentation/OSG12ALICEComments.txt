---++ Final Results:

   * test jobs run successfully on BNL_ITB_Test1, LBNL_DSD_ITB and CIT_ITB_1.  
   * alice credentials rejected on FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB and UC_ITB
   * alice credentials via voms-proxy were accepted, mapped appropriately, and allowed test jobs to run on CIT_ITB_1
   * attempt build a vo-box on LBNL_DSD_ITB for more complete testing were not completed.  We will continue with this in our testing of ALICE infrastructure with OSG.

---++ Known issues

   * Running =voms-proxy-init= on a newly installed ITB client fails <b>Silently</b>.   The vomses file is there.  But when I specify the file explicitly on the command line I get a more explicit error: <pre>
 $ voms-proxy-init -voms alice -vomses glite/etc/vomses 
data format in file: glite/etc/vomses incorrect!
Line: jdem" "voms.fnal.gov" "15028" "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=http/voms.fnal.gov""jdem"
</pre>
  
%NOTE% The above error in the vomses file was a [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7171][GOC Ticket 7171]] and has been fixed.  The <b> Silent </b> failure is an [[https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?53450][lcg ticket]] that remains in progress. 

   * simple run of =globus-job-run <i>contact-string</i> usr/bin/whoami= under 3 conditions: grid-proxy, voms-proxy from alice, voms-proxy from star. Result are shown and/or globus error code (Note: ecause of problem above, client is OSG:1.1.0 client) : *Updated:* CIT_ITB_1 now accepts voms-proxy from alice and maps user to 'alice' user.

%NOTE% I believe the above results are expected from the configuration for ALICE.  Not ideal for testing purposes but consistent.

---++ *Comments*

| Were there any successful jobs run on these sites?  What kind of jobs? | Main.RobGardner | 21 Jul 2009 - 14:38 |
| Yes - I ran a set of test jobs at each site.  These jobs simply test that the infrastructure is present for us.   When I obtained a proxy with 'voms-proxy-init -voms star',  the jobs ran successfully on all sites.  When I used a proxy obtained with 'voms-proxy-init -voms alice', the FNAL,UC,&CIT sites rejected the credentials.  The BNL & LBNL sites accepted the jobs and ran successfully though the environment was as if I had used my STAR voms proxy.  | Main.JeffPorter | 21 Jul 2009 - 19:21 |
