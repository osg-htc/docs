Fixing a Damaged Pacman installation

%EDITTHIS%

---++ How damage happens
Pacman installations can be damaged for any number of reasons. I (Steve Timm) present a case that happened in OSG 0.6.0 (VDT 1.6.1).   A couple
of new packages had been released and so  I tried to do a pacman --update (without actually specifying a particular package) to pull down all the packages at once.  No error was reported but
the setup.sh and setup.csh had shrunk to half of their normal size. A pacman -setup gave the following:

<pre class="screen">
Installation contains uninstalled packages.  See % pacman -lc.
Package [http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_161_cache:SRM-V1-Client] not [installed]: Package [http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_161_cache:SRM-V1-Client] has not been installed.  Can't setup.
Package [/usr/local/vdt-1.6.1:OSG:ce] not [installed]:
    Package [/usr/local/vdt-1.6.1:OSG:ce] has not been installed.  Can't setup.

%ENDTWISTY%

So what had happened is that someone had added packages SRM-V1-Client and SRM-V2-Client to the default definition of OSG:ce *after* the OSG 0.6.0
release.  Pacman is smart enough to detect they are missing but not to just go out and get them.

The first time I tried to debug this, I did pacman -repair.  That was a mistake. It blew some 15 packages away and I was forced to reinstall them one by one.
I could have and should have just installed the SRM clients. First verifying from http://software.grid.iu.edu which cache they are supposed to come from, i.e. straight from the VDT or via the OSG.

Then 
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_161_cache:SRM-V1-Client
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_161_cache:SRM-V2-Client
</pre>
After this I got the following:
<pre class="screen">
Message has not been shown
Package [/usr/local/vdt-1.6.1:OSG:ce] not [installed]:
    Package [/usr/local/vdt-1.6.1:OSG:ce] has not been installed.  Can't setup.
[root@d0cabosg2 vdt]#      
root@d0cabosg2 vdt]# pacman -get OSG:ce
Package [/usr/local/vdt-1.6.1:OSG:ce] not [installed]:
    Package [/usr/local/vdt-1.6.1:OSG:osg-auto-0.6.0] not [installed]:
        Failure attempting to [cd /usr/local/vdt-1.6.1/auto-vdt-1.6.1, retract to /usr/local/vdt-1.6.1] at [/usr/local/vdt-1.6.1].
</pre>
But by making the directory, then the install was successful.
<pre class="screen">
[root@d0cabosg2 vdt]# mkdir auto-vdt-1.6.1
[root@d0cabosg2 vdt]# pacman -get OSG:ce

Pacman Installation of OSG-0.6.0 Complete
</pre>

It was then necessary to make sure that necessary services which had been updated were re-enabled.  Sometimes this can be done with =vdt-control --on=, other times you have to run configure-osg again.

---++Update for newer OSG versions

In later pacman versions it is much less common for Pacman itself to mess up.  Most pacman updates are now done under the
control of the vdt updater and that helps a lot.  If there are problems they 
come when pacman packages in VDT or OSG caches are not structured correctly.  The same principles
in the above example apply.

If you see an [X] next to the package listing in the pacman -lc output, 
and uninstalled packages below it, try to install those packages.  If you can't do that, then try to remove
the broken package, and then one by one all packages directly above it that depend on it.  If that would lead to 
the removal of the top-level package itself then you have to wipe the installation and start from scratch,
or restore from your backups, which you did make, right?

It can also happen sometimes that pacman's database thinks that the package is installed but none of the
files from the package are there anymore. In this case there is nothing to be done but to wipe the installation
and reinstall or restore from backups.

If pacman gives an install error either on the command line or on vdt-install.log or both, then first of all save the 
vdt-install.log as it was at that time, and the error message. Two of the most common errors are forgetting 
to put batch system binaries (PBS, LSF, SGE) in the PATH, or trying to install a VDT when you have already
got a full set of environment variables in your environment from the old one.  If there are things missing in your PATH
you can usually add them and retry the install. If there is extra stuff in your path it is better to start from scratch.
