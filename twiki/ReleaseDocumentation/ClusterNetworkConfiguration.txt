---++ Introduction
In this module we discuss a few details regarding the layout and configuration of the test cluster's network.  These instructions assume that DNS and DHCP services are *not* available to the servers. 


*NOTE - DISCLAIMER:*
   * The configuration described here is meant only to be suggestive for a (*small*) test-lab environment, and only for the purposes of this tutorial.   Network configurations for clusters vary greatly depending on the local environment, the scale of the facility, and conventions used by and preferences of systems administrators.   You should get into contact with your local network administrator to find out more information about your campus' network infrastructure and services.  For larger installations DNS and DHCP servers should probably be used.


---++ The network layout
We will assume that all the machines are on the same network (public or private).  If the machines are all located on a private network, then the client machines attempting to submit jobs to the Condor job manager, or in the case of Grid users, the compute element (gatekeeper), would obviously need to be on that network as well.  A simple network configuration (that will work both when the machines are in a public network and also when they are isolated on a private VLAN) can be created using the =/etc/hosts= file and static IP addresses.

---++ Configuration: /etc/hosts

   * The  =/etc/hosts=  contains a "map" of the cluster, resolving the =localhost= and all the hosts both as FQDN and short name.  The file should be the same on all machines in the cluster. 
   * Create =/etc/hosts= on the main head node (which is serving as a management node here):  *gc1*.
   * Copy the file to each of the hosts in the cluster.  Make sure that any updates on the master copy on the management node get propagated.


---++ Configuration: /etc/resolv.conf

   * The =/etc/resolv.conf= must contain the correct DNS IPs appropriate for the local environment.  If DHCP is used, this file is written automatically by the client.


---++ Configuration: /etc/sysconfig/network

   * The =/etc/sysconfig/network= contains the FQDN of the host and the gateway used. Here is an example:<pre>
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=gc1-ce.yourdomain.org
GATEWAY=192.168.1.254
</pre>


---++ Configuration: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
   * The  =/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0= file (if using =eth0=) can be configured to use a static IP or DHCP.  The IPADDR value must be consistent with the IP assigned in the =/etc/hosts= file.  Some of the lines are: <pre>
BOOTPROTO=static
TYPE=Ethernet
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
IPADDR=192.168.1.51
</pre>


---++ Configuration: /etc/nsswitch.conf

   * The =/etc/nsswitch.conf= instructs the host to look first in the =/etc/hosts= file using this line:<pre>
#hosts:     db files ldap nis dns
hosts:      files dns
</pre>



---++ Protecting /etc/resolv.conf

*NOTE:* the following are notes that resulted from a special situation where /etc/resolv.conf was being overwritten by a DHCP client.  This should not be important for the tutorial and is not a standard recommendation.

   * If a host has multiple network interfaces (e.g. dual homed hosts) and runs a DHCP client on the second interface, this replaces =/etc/resolv.conf=. 
   * The controlling parameter in the network configuration script is =PEERDNS= which can be assigned either =yes= or =no=. 
      * If  =yes= modify =/etc/resolv.conf= with information from the server.  *If using DHCP, then yes is the default.* 
      * If =no=  do not modify =/etc/resolv.conf= 
   * NOTE: the  =/etc/resolv.conf= file can be write protected with =chattr= command under the Linux ext3 file system: <pre>chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf</pre>
   * This is a bit hackish and obscure, as its making up for a shortcoming in the DNS server by making the file immutable.   For more discussion on this topic, see: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/dhclient-etcresolvconf-hooks/.
