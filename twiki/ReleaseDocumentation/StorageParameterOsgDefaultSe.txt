---++ Introduction
The OSG_DEFAULT_SE variable represents a Storage Element closely related to the CE, accessible from within the cluster (visible to worker nodes) only via SE access methods such as Gridftp or SRM. If OSG_DEFAULT_SE is accessible from outside, it is the preferred SE for the CE and should be used when doing a two- or more step copy of input datasets to the CE. For example, doing a 3rd-party transfer to OSG_DEFAULT_SE, then copying to OSG_WN_TMP using a client program.

In a simple cluster, OSG_DEFAULT_SE could be an SE visible from both inside and outside, and serving an internally shared space like OSG_DATA. This would allow I/O via grid tools in sites that had no shared space.

The value to be specified in OSG_DEFAULT_SE is the full URL, including method, host/port and path of the base dir. This full URL must be reachable from inside as well as outside the cluster. The OSG_DEFAULT_SE generally supports only put and get, rather than open/read/write/close. 

If the CE has no default SE it can use the value UNAVAILABLE for OSG_DEFAULT_SE or it can use the address for the gridftp server that has access to [[StorageParameterOsgData][OSG_DATA]].

---++ Typical uses of OSG_DEFAULT_SE
   * Staging in of large input files (e.g. datasets)
   * Staging out of large output files (e.g. datasets)

---++ Notes
   * The current release supports SRM and gsiftp for OSG_DEFAULT_SE.
   * The read and write access urls to the OSG_DEFAULT_SE can be used for [[StorageParameterOsgSiteRead][OSG_SITE_READ]] and [[StorageParameterOsgSiteWrite][OSG_SITE_WRITE]].
