If you plan to use VOMRS with VOMS, then install only the VOMRS package; it includes VOMS.  (In other words, you won't need to install VOMS separately.) You still need to look through this whole document since you need to prepare for installation of both services. Pacman is the installation method.

---++ Certificates
If you don't already have an existing, valid host certificate, get it now.  Also get an http cert. You don't need an ldap cert. 

The cert-scripts package isn't currently packaged with voms.  Instructions for getting the certificate can be found in [[GetHostServiceCertificates][Get Host Certificates]].  You'll need to put them in the correct places as shown below.

%NOTE% Although this can be done as a post-install step, we recommend you get them in advance. If you wait till after the install, you'll need to run =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_voms= by hand once your certs are installed and before you verify the voms installation.

---+++ !!HOST certificate
During the installation and configure process (using the =configure_voms= script) to create a VO, the HOST certificate is added to the VOMS Global ACL list for the VO being created. This allows the root user on this machine to update the VOMS VO using the =voms-admin= command, so that, in effect, the root user is already a VO-Admin in this VO. This is the only purpose for this certificate at this time.

The host certificate should be installed in =/etc/grid-security= with ownership and permissions as:

<pre class="screen">
-rw-r--r--  1 root   root    1176 Nov  7 16:38 hostcert.pem
-r--------  1 root   root     887 Nov  7 16:38 hostkey.pem
</pre>


---+++ !!HTTP certificate
Used by Apache and the VOMS server.

The HTTP certificate for your system should be installed in =/etc/grid-security/http= with ownership and permission as:

<pre class="screen">
# <b>/etc/grid-security</b>
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         4096 Aug 31 23:00 http

# <b>/etc/grid-security/http</b>
-rw-r--r--    1 daemon   daemon       1169 May  8 10:38 httpcert.pem
-r--------    1 daemon   daemon        887 May  8 10:38 httpkey.pem
</pre>

---++ Firewall check
Make certain that port 8443 is open through your site firewall and any host-based firewall (iptables, etc.).  Note that unlike GUMS, which is local to your site or a particular user account space, the VOMRS and VOMS servers need to be queried by anyone who wants to support your VO.

---++ Previous installations
If you have an OSG VOMS running and you're about to reinstall or if any of the following daemons are installed and running on your machine, see the [[VomsShutdownGuide][Shutdown instructions]]. 

In addition, if you have a previous installation with the <i>cloned</i> HOST certificate (<i>/etc/grid-security/vomscert.pem - vomskey.pem</i>), you should remove them. The HTTP certificate described above will replace them.

You should also remove the <i>/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded</i> process.  The EDG CRL upgrade is invoked using <i>root</i> cron.

---++ Define link for certificates
%NOTE% Check that a soft link from =/etc/grid-security/certificates= to this =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA= before proceeding with the installation, in order to avoid certain startup problems and error messages in the resulting services.
