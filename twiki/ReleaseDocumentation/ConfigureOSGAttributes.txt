%ICON{hand}% This document is for System Administrators. The procedure to configure an installation of the %LINK_VDT% is presented and all configuration variables will be introduced.

%STARTINCLUDE%

%STARTSECTION{"ConfigurationProcedure"}%
---%SHIFT%+ Configuration Procedure

The procedure to configure an installation of the %LINK_VDT% consists of three steps:

   1 edit the configuration file =%UCL_CWD%/osg/etc/config.ini=
   1 verify the configuration file =%UCL_CWD%/osg/etc/config.ini= using =%UCL_CWD%/osg/bin/configure-osg=
   1 run the configuration script =%UCL_CWD%/osg/bin/configure-osg=

The final steps are:

   * set attributes in =config.ini= as described below
   * run post installation for standard services (GIP, Gratia, CEMon, Authentication, RSV, and WS-GRAM)
   * configure any optional services (Squid, <nop>MonALISA)
   * copy =%UCL_CWD%/osg/etc/locations/grid3-locations.txt= to =$OSG_APP/etc/grid3-locations.txt= 
%ENDSECTION{"ConfigurationProcedure"}%

%STARTSECTION{"EditConfigFile"}%
---%SHIFT%++ Edit the Configuration File

Syntax and formatting rules for the configuration file can be found [[ConfigurationFileFormat][here]]. An exhaustive discussion of configuration options can be found in the [[ConfigurationFileHelp][reference guide]]. Refer to the [[QuickInstallGuide][Quick Install Guide]] for a minimal number of changes required for =config.ini=.

---%SHIFT%+++ Default Information

The first section in the configuration file =%UCL_CWD%/osg/etc/config.ini= is used to specify default attributes to be used in the remainder of the file. Please fill in the fully qualified domain name of your resource and the administrator e-mail.

[DEFAULT]
; Use this section to define variables that will be used in other sections
; For example, if you define a variable called dcache_root here
; you can use it in the gip section as %(dcache_root)s  (e.g.
; my_vo_1_dir = %(dcache_root)s/my_vo_1
; my_vo_2_dir = %(dcache_root)s/my_vo_2

; Defaults, please don't modify these variables
unavailable = UNAVAILABLE
default = UNAVAILABLE

; Name these variables disable and enable rather than disabled and enabled
; to avoid infinite recursions
disable = False
enable = True

; You can modify the following and use them
localhost = %UCL_HOST_FQDN%
admin_email = admin@%UCL_HOST_FQDN%

---%SHIFT%+++ Site Information

The attributes in the section labeled =[Site Information]= require that you registered your resource with the %LINK_OIM%. All attributes in this section are required and must be set.

%ICON{hand}% The =latitude= and =longitude= for your resource location can be found using this [[http://www.earthtools.org/][external tool]] not affiliated with the %LINK_OSG%.

---%SHIFT%+++ Accounting and Information Services

The =[Gratia]= and =[CEMon]= sections configure accounting and information services respectively.  For each finished grid job on your %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%, Gratia sends a record to the central OSG server; this ensures usage of your site gets fairly accounted for.  CEMon will periodically run a software called GIP, saving the resulting information about your site, and uploading it to various servers.


---%SHIFT%++++ CEMon

The =[Cemon]= section in the resource configuration file =%UCL_CWD%/osg/etc/config.ini= defines variables =ress_servers= and =bdii_servers=. The default values are chosen according to your type of installation and do not require to be changed.


---%SHIFT%++++ Gratia

The =[Gratia]= section in the resource configuration file =%UCL_CWD%/osg/etc/config.ini= contains the =probes= attribute which can be used to define the list of probes to be run. The default values are chosen according to your type of installation and do not require to be changed.


---%SHIFT%+++ Storage Information

Use the =[Storage]= section to define the mass storage provided by your site.

   * =grid_dir=: the top-level directory of the worker node client on the worker nodes.
   * =app_dir=: shared directory where VO applications will be installed; also known as $OSG_APP
   * =data_dir=: shared directory where VOs may save their data files; also known as $OSG_DATA
   * =worker_node_tmp=: location of a non-shared directory on the worker nodes where VOs can write their scratch files; also known as $OSG_WN_TMP

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_MORE%}%
%CODE{"scheme"}%
[Storage]
;
; Several of these values are constrained and need to be set in a way
; that is consistent with one of the OSG storage models
;
; Please refer to the OSG release documentation for an indepth explanation
; of the various storage models and the requirements for them

; If you have a SE available for your cluster and wish to make it available
; to incoming jobs, set se_available to True, otherwise set it to False
se_available = %(disable)s

; If you indicated that you have an se available at your cluster, set default_se to
; the hostname of this SE, otherwise set default_se to UNAVAILABLE
default_se = %(unavailable)s

; The grid_dir setting should point to the directory which holds the files
; from the OSG worker node package, it should be visible on all of the computer
; nodes (read access is required, worker nodes don't need to be able to write)
; 
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS
grid_dir = %(unavailable)s

; The app_dir setting should point to the directory which contains the VO
; specific applications, this should be visible on both the CE and worker nodes
; but only the CE needs to have write access to this directory
; 
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS
app_dir = /mnt/nfs/osg/app

; The data_dir setting should point to a directory that can be used to store
; and stage data in and out of the cluster.  This directory should be readable
; and writable on both the CE and worker nodes
; 
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS
data_dir = /mnt/nfs/osg/data

; The worker_node_temp directory should point to a directory that can be used
; as scratch space on compute nodes, it should allow read and write access on the
; worker nodes but can be local to each worker node
; 
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS
worker_node_temp = /tmp

; The site_read setting should be the location or url to a directory that can
; be read to stage in data, this is an url if you are using a SE
; 
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS
site_read = %(unavailable)s

; The site_write setting should be the location or url to a directory that can
; be write to stage out data, this is an url if you are using a SE
;
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS
site_write = %(unavailable)s
%ENDCODE%
%ENDTWISTY%

If you'll be advertising an SE associated with your resource, you should make sure to add the [[GipConfiguration#StorageElementConfiguration][appropriate entries]] to your ini file as well.

---%SHIFT%++ Verify the Configuration File

Here we assume that you have completed the previous step to edit the configuration file. Before you proceed you should verify the new configuration file using =configure-osg=:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% configure-osg -v

---+!! Advanced Topics


Feedback from reviewer was that they found this section confusing and unnecessary, especially in the install documents.  Commenting it out so we can review things later; at the least, the migration steps aren't going to work.

 Typical Workflows 

There are three typical use cases for using the configure-osg script:  moving/upgrading an existing installation, configuring a brand new installation,  modifying the configuration of a working installation.  The workflows for these three cases are listed here.

   * *Moving/upgrading an existing installation* not configured using configure-osg
      * Source =setup.sh= from the new installation
      * export OLD_VDT_LOCATION pointing to source installation.
      * Extract the old configuration by running =configure-osg -e= . This will produce a configuration file, =extracted-config.ini=.
      * Edit the extracted-config.ini to correct any mistakes, change any references to the original installation, and to add any missing options.  Then backup =$OSG_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini=, and then copy =extracted-config.ini= to =$OSG_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini=
      * <b>Test</b> the configuration by running =configure-osg -v=. 
      * Configure the new installation by running =configure-osg -c=
   * *Moving/upgrading an existing installation* configured using configure-osg
      * Source =setup.sh= from the new installation
      * Locate the ini file used to configure the old installation and copy it to =$OSG_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini=
      * Change any path references in the config.ini from the old installation location to the current installation location
      * <b>Test</b> the configuration by running =configure-osg -v=. 
      * Configure the new installation by running =configure-osg -c=
   * *Configuration of a brand new installation*:
      * Source =setup.sh= from the new installation
      * Create or copy a  =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= with information that is required for your site 
      * <b>Test</b> the configuration by running =configure-osg -v=.
      * Configure the new installation by running =configure-osg -c=
   * *Modify the configuration* of a working installation
      * edit =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= file with changes (e.g. new SE, number of nodes in cluster, ...)
      * <b>Test</b> the configuration by running =configure-osg -v=.
      * Configure the new installation by running =configure-osg -c=
