%TOC%

---++ Acknowledgements
   * Thanks to Main.SuchandraThapa whose excellent CE Installation notes are the basis for this tutorial.
   * Thanks to Main.SarahWilliams for initial version of this tutorial

---++ Requirements
   * A !RedHat-linux based server like !RHEL, !CentOS, and Scientific Linux.
   * A fully-qualifed hostname for the server
   * A valid host certificate
   * SSH access and root access
   * These ports open through the firewall: 2119, 2811, 8443

---++ Caveats
   * Skipping full authorization setup (see documentation for changes needed to do this)
   * Assumes condor will be used and installed in osg ce directory 
   
---++ Preparing the server
   * Create the /etc/grid-security directory to hold the server certificates
<pre class="screen">
$ cd /etc
$ mkdir grid-security
$ chmod 755 grid-security
</pre>
   * Copy hostcert.pem & hostkey.pem to /etc/grid-security/
<pre class="screen">
$ scp host*.pem root@installhost:/etc/grid-security/
</pre>
   * Check that the hostcert is correct.  The CN should be the fully qualified domain name of your server, and notAfter should not be expired.
<pre class="screen">
$ openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -noout -subject -enddate
subject= /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=uct2-grid6.uchicago.edu
notAfter=Oct 23 17:24:54 2009 GMT
</pre>
   * Turn off SELinux
   * Check for required library libstdc++.so.5
<pre class="screen">
$ ldconfig -p | grep libstdc++.so.5
</pre>
If necessary, install it:
<pre class="screen">
$ yum -y install compat-libstdc++-33
</pre>
   * Check for required client ldapsearch, and install if neccessary
<pre class="screen">
$ which ldapsearch
$ yum -y install openldap-clients
</pre>
   * Add a user account and install your personal grid certificate
<pre class="screen">
$ useradd sarah
$ passwd sarah
$ su – sarah
$ mkdir .globus
$ chmod 0755 .globus
$ cd .globus
$ scp user*.pem installhost:/home/sarah/.globus/
$ chmod 0644 usercert.pem 
$ chmod 0400 userkey.pem
</pre>
   * Add a user account for the RSV service
<pre class="screen">
$ useradd rsv_user
$ passwd rsv_user
</pre>

---++ Installation
This guide will assume that you install software in the /opt directory and that this directory is located on a local drive (or a networked drive that has fairly high performance and low latency).  The installation will require about 4 GB of space.  This guide will also install a condor batch manager in your osg installation.  *Please adjust this to your specific circumstances.*

If you are installing on a server that already has a jobmanager, please read the documentation on [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall#Install_job_managers][Install job managers]].  If you do not have a jobmanager, Condor will be installed with OSG:Globus-Condor-Setup.

---+++ Create directories for OSG services
<pre class="screen">
$  cd /opt
$ mkdir share
$ mkdir share/data
$ mkdir share/app
$  mkdir wn-client
$  chmod a+rwx /opt/share/*
$  mkdir osg
$  mkdir osg-1.0.0
$  mount --bind osg-1.0.0 osg
$  mkdir pacman
</pre>
 Using a bind mount lets you refer to things in /opt/osg so that you can upgrade your osg ce installation in a versioned directory (e.g. osg-x.y.z) and seamlessly switch from an older install to a newer install.

---+++ Pacman
The first component you will need to install is pacman.  Pacman is the package manager that is used by the OSG to distribute it's software.  The installation process for this is fairly simple and is outlined below

<pre class="screen">
$ cd /opt
$ wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-latest.tar.gz
--15:20:25--  http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-latest.tar.gz
           => `pacman-latest.tar.gz'
Resolving physics.bu.edu... 128.197.41.42
Connecting to physics.bu.edu|128.197.41.42|:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
Length: 852,424 (832K) [application/x-gzip]

100%[====================================>] 852,424        1.67M/s             

15:20:26 (1.67 MB/s) - `pacman-latest.tar.gz' saved [852424/852424]
$ tar xzf pacman-latest.tar.gz
</pre>
   * At this point you will have a directory called pacman-*x.xx* where *x.xx* is version number of pacman
<pre class="screen">
$ mount --bind pacman-*x.xx* pacman
</pre>
This will allow you to upgrade pacman at a later time without changing your references to the pacman binaries
<pre class="screen">
$ cd pacman
$ source setup.sh
</pre>
 This step will initialize the pacman setup and get the correct environment variables and paths into your environment.

At this point, pacman is setup and is ready for your use.

---+++ Installing the CE software
This guide assumes that you will be using a gridmap for your setup and not a GUMS server.  To setup things up using a gums server, please refer to the release documentation for OSG CE software.

<pre class="screen">
$ cd osg
$ export PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR=/opt/osg/gratia/var/data
$ pacman -get OSG:ce

All prerequisite checks are satisfied.
                                                               


========== IMPORTANT ==========
The VDT no longer installs certificate authority certificates at install time.
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.



Existing /tmp/opt/osg-1.0.0/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf moved to /tmp/opt/osg-1.0.0/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf.orig
Merge it manually with the new /tmp/opt/osg-1.0.0/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf if you had a special edg-mkgridmap.conf
                                  
Pacman Installation of OSG-1.0.0 Complete
</pre>
<pre class="screen">
$ source setup.sh
$ pacman -get OSG:Globus-Condor-Setup
$ pacman -get OSG:ManagedFork
</pre>

The software should be installed at this point and you can move on to configuration.

---+++ Configuring the CE software
At this point, the CE software will have been installed and is partially configured.  There are a few more steps needed to get a working setup.

---++++ Generating service certificates (Optional)
If you already have your service certificates, or if you only intend this CE as a demonstration, you can skip this section.  Otherwise, the instructions in this section will allow you to create service certificates.

Log in to a machine with OSG clients installed. Go to a directory that is readable only by you and which can be used to hold your certificate requests and private keys. Then run the following commands:
<pre class="screen">
$ source $OSG_LOCATION/setup.sh

$ mkdir http_cert
$ cd http_cert
$ cert-request  -host your.host  -dir .  -ou s -service http 
$ mkdir rsv_cert
$ cd rsv_cert
$ cert-request  -host your.host  -dir .  -ou s -service rsv 
</pre>

You will need to answer a few questions when generating the requests and will get a serial number after the command completes.  This serial will let you retrieve your certificate once it has been signed.  Also after running these commands, you will have a file of the form xxxkey.pem where xxx is a number.  You will need that file since it contains the private key for your certificate.    

After a little time, you should receive an email from the registration authority (RA) of the virtual organization (VO) that you indicated that your site is a member of.  The email will give you instructions on how to retrieve your host certificates.  When you have retrieved them, install them on your server.
<pre class="screen">
$ mkdir /etc/grid-security/http
$ mkdir /etc/grid-security/rsv
$ cp http_cert/*key.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem
$ cp http_cert/*cert.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem
$ cp rsv_cert/*cert.pem /etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvcert.pem
$ cp rsv_cert/*key.pem /etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvkey.pem
</pre>

---++++ Installing service certificates

If you do not have service certificates for RSV and HTTP, you will need to use your host cert.
<pre class="screen">
$ cd /etc/grid-security
$ mkdir http
$ mkdir rsv
$ cp hostkey.pem http/httpkey.pem
$ cp hostcert.pem http/httpcert.pem
$ cp hostkey.pem rsv/rsvkey.pem
$ cp hostcert.pem rsv/rsvcert.pem
</pre>

Then, set permissions correctly on your certs.
<pre class="screen">
$ chmod 755 /etc/grid-security/http
$ chmod 755 /etc/grid-security/rsv
$ chmod 644 /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
$ chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
$ chmod 644 /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem
$ chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem
$ chmod 644 /etc/grid-security/containercert.pem
$ chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/containerkey.pem
$ chmod 644 /etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvcert.pem
$ chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvkey.pem
 </pre>  

---++++ Setting up a simple gridmap file
For a simple install, you can use a gridmap file to create a list of users that are allowed to access your compute element. 

Here you will need to replace *DN* with the DN of your personal grid certificate and *USER_ACCOUNT* with the name of the account that this DN should map to.  *Note, the do not map this DN to root or any other privileged account*
      * Hint: =openssl x509 -in /home/sarah/.globus/usercert.pem -noout -subject=
<pre class="screen">
$ echo '"DN" USER_ACCOUNT' >> grid-mapfile
</pre>
Here you will need to replace *DN* with the DN of your rsv service certificate.  *Note, the do not map this DN to root or any other privileged account*
      * Hint: =openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvcert.pem -noout -subject=
<pre class="screen">
$ echo '"RSVDN" rsv_user' >> grid-mapfile
$ chmod 644 grid-mapfile
</pre>

---++++ Add VO support to the gridmap file
In order to support VOs you will need to download their users and add accounts for them.  First, back up your local users:
<pre class="screen">
$ cp /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile-local
</pre>
Edit /opt/osg/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf and add this line to the end. 
<pre class="screen">
gmf_local /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile-local
</pre>
Also, in this file you will see lines that look like this:
<pre class="screen">
# USER-VO-MAP ilc ILC -- 31 -- Lynn Garren (garren@fnal.gov)
group vomss://voms.fnal.gov:8443/voms/ilc ilc
</pre>
Each is a VO that will be allowed to log in to your gatekeeper.  Comment out each that you do not wish to support.  For our exercise, we want OSG and OSGEDU only.  We should create accounts for these users:
<pre class="screen">
$ useradd osg
$ passwd osg
$ useradd osgedu
$ passwd osg
</pre>

If this is too much typing, here is a correct copy of [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/ReleaseDocumentation/GridSiteInstallationTutorial/edg-mkgridmap.conf][edg-mkgridmap.conf]]

Turn on edg-mkgridmap and run it for the first time.
<pre class="screen">
$ vdt-register-service --name edg-mkgridmap --enable
$ vdt-control --on edg-mkgridmap
$ /opt/osg/edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap  >>/opt/osg/edg/log/edg-mkgridmap.log 2>&1
</pre>

Check the gridmap to see the new account mappings.
<pre class="screen">
$ head /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
"/C=AR/O=e-Ciencia/OU=UNLP/L=CeSPI/CN=Fernando Monticelli" usatlas1
"/C=AT/O=AustrianGrid/OU=UIBK/OU=astro/OU=HEPHY/CN=Brigitte Epp" usatlas1
"/C=AT/O=AustrianGrid/OU=UIBK/OU=astro/OU=HEPHY/CN=Emmerich Kneringer" usatlas1
</pre>

---++++ Setting up your CA certificate updater
You will now need to setup and retrieve the ca certs updater
   * Open =/opt/osg/vdt/etc/vdt-update-certs.conf= in your text editor of choice
   * Uncomment the line the following line (i.e. remove the leading =#= mark)
<pre class="screen">
#cacerts_url = http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version
</pre>
   * Run the following commands at the command line:
<pre class="screen">
$ source $VDT_LOCATION/vdt-questions.sh; $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-setup-ca-certificates
$ vdt-control --enable vdt-update-certs
$ vdt-control --on vdt-update-certs
</pre>

You should now have the ca certs updater setup and it will automatically update your ca certificates using the certs distributed by the OSG grid operations center (GOC).

---++++ Configuring your system 
Here we will configure the majority of the system using the configure-osg script and a configuration file.  In order to do this, follow the steps below:

<pre class="screen">

---++++ Configuring WS-GRAM
The ws-gram system is a web services enabled method for submitting and monitoring jobs on grid resources.  The ws-gram system requires the following steps to configure it.
   * Set the ownership for the new container certs
<pre class="screen">
$ chown daemon /etc/grid-security/container*.pem
</pre>
   * run =visudo= to edit the sudoers file
<pre class="screen">

Several services provided by the VDT create unbounded log files.  If you wish, we can rotate those file on a daily basis.

Would you like to setup daily rotation of VDT log files?

Possible answers:
    y: Yes, I want the service to run automatically (once enabled)
    n: No, I do NOT want the service to run automatically

Note: Services are enabled with vdt-control; see 'post-install/README'.

y

Do you want to run a cron job that will update the CA certificate
revocation lists automatically? This will use the fetch-crl program
that comes with the VDT. The cron job will run at a random time
between midnight and 6:00am. We select a random time to avoid having
all VDT installations fetching CRLs at the same time.

Do you want to automatically update your CA certificates? If so,
we will check for updates once a day via cron.

The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files 
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to 
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have 
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.10.1/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?

Choices:
	r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
	           (existing CA files will be preserved)
	l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
	n (no)    - do not install
l
                                                        


========== IMPORTANT ==========
The VDT no longer installs certificate authority certificates at install time.
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.



                                                                         
The OSG Worker Node Client package version 1.0.1 has been installed.

---+++++ Setting up your CA certificate updater
Similar to the OSG:CE install, you will now need to setup and retrieve the ca certs updater
   * Open =/opt/wn-client/vdt/etc/vdt-update-certs.conf= in your text editor of choice
   * Uncomment the line the following line (i.e. remove the leading =#= mark)
<pre class="screen">
#cacerts_url = http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version
</pre>
   * Run the following commands at the command line:
<pre class="screen">
$ source /opt/wn-client/setup.sh
$ source $VDT_LOCATION/vdt-questions.sh; $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-setup-ca-certificates
$ vdt-control --enable vdt-update-certs
$ vdt-control --on vdt-update-certs
</pre>

You should now have the ca certs updater setup and it will automatically update your ca certificates using the certs distributed by the OSG grid operations center (GOC).

---++  Testing your installation
We will test your installation by checking to see whether it accepts grid jobs, gridftp requests, ws-gram job requests and that the rsv system checks are up and running.

For these steps, you will need to  login to your user account which should have your grid cert and key in the =~/.globus= directory.  Before you start you will need to do the following:
<pre class="screen">
$ source  /opt/osg/setup.sh
$ grid-proxy-init
[sthapa@uct3-edge6 ~]$ grid-proxy-init
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Suchandra Thapa 757586
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Creating proxy ...................................................... Done
Your proxy is valid until: Wed Nov 12 23:21:53 2008
</pre>

----++++ Testing grid jobs
Here we will test the grid job submission system.  You can do this using the following steps, where your.ce.hostname is replaced with the hostname of your install host:
<pre class="screen">
$ globus-job-run your.ce.hostname:2119/jobmanager /usr/bin/id
</pre>

You should get the uid and gids for the user account that your DN is mapped to.  In addition, you should be able to do this using a different job manager by specifying jobmanager-condor instead of jobmanager.

---++++ Testing gridftp
Gridftp is a system for transfering files between various grid aware systems.  You can test your system by following the steps below:
 <pre class="screen">   
$ echo "test file" > test.file
$ globus-url-copy file:///$PWD/test.file gsiftp://your.ce.hostname/tmp/
</pre>
   * Once this is done, you should see a test.file in the /tmp on your ce
<pre class="screen">
$ globus-url-copy gsiftp://your.ce.hostname/tmp/test.file file:///$PWD/new.file
</pre>
   * Once this is done, you should have a file called new.file in your current directory

---++++ Testing WS-GRAM
Testing ws-gram is similar to testing the job grid submission:
<pre class="screen">
$ globusrun-ws -submit -Ft Fork -F your.ce.hostname:9443 -s -c /usr/bin/whoami=
</pre>

You should get the uid and gids for the user account that your DN is mapped to.  In addition, you should be able to do this using a different job manager by specifying Condor instead of Fork.

---++++ Checking RSV
RSV consists of a series of probes that run at varying intervals on your system to test your system's integrity and functionality. You can see the results of these probe tests by going to [[https://your.ce.hostname:8443/rsv/][https://your.ce.hostname:8443/rsv/]].

----++++
At this point your installation should be complete and operational.
