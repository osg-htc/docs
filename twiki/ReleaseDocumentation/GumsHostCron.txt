---+!! Grid User Mapping Service (GUMS) Host Cron
%TOC%

---++ About this Document
This document describes the gums-host-cron.  The gums-host-cron is used to keep the =grid-mapfile= (if used) and =osg-user-vo-map.txt= files up to date.  

---+++ Background
To keep the *grid-mapfile* (if used) and *osg-user-vo-map.txt* files up to date, a cron file and script were installed but need to be activated.
   * In the Compatibility mode, both the grid-mapfile and osg-user-vo-map-txt need to be updated at the same time from your GUMS server. 
   * In the Full Privilege mode, only the osg-user-vo-map.txt needs to be updated from your GUMS server.

---++ Service Activiation
To turn on the gums-host-cron for a [[ReleaseDocumentation.ComputeElementInstall][CE installation]].  
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --on gums-host-cron
</pre>

These commands will make a entry in root's crontab.

---++ Service Operation
The gums-host-cron script (=$VDT_LOCATION/gums/scripts/gums-host-cron=) does the following:
   1. It executes the =gums-host= command  using both the =generateGridMapfile= and =generateGrid3UserVoMap= arguments. In order to determine your authorization mode, the script looks for the existence of the PRIMA callout in the =/etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf= file.  If present, it assumes Full Privilege mode.  If not, it assumes Compatiblity mode.
   1. It will create a temporary copy of the files and compare them against the current copy.
   1. It only updates the CE nodes current copy if a change has occurred.  When a change is effected, a backup of the old file with a =*.cronsaved= suffix will be created.   This allows an administrator to more easily identify any changes.   The date of the backup file will reflect when it was last in effect.
   1. At the completion of each successful run, it will create an empty =osg-user-vo-map.last-checked= file.  This file allows the administrator(s) to more easily verify the currency of the data.
   1. Finally, it calls the =configure_gip= script to make sure that any newly-supported VO's are correctly published to the Generic Information Providers.

---++ Service Verification
To test the =gums-host-cron= script and to initially populate the two files for the first time using your GUMS server (as =root=):
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% $VDT_LOCATION/gums/scripts/gums-host-cron
</pre>


%IMPORTANT% Beginning with OSG 0.6.0/ITB 0.5.1, the =grid3-user-vo-map.txt= file was deprecated.  It is replaced by =osg-user-vo-map.txt= (same contents, new file name).   To facilitate the transition, the scripts that maintain this file will insure both files exists (the old one symlinked to the new one).   So when you see this occur, do not be concerned.  At some point in the future when all components referencing this file have been changed, the scripts will remove all evidence of this little inconvenience.
