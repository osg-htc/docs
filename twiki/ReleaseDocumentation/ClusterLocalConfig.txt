---++ Introduction
This document is intended to show the steps already performed in configuring the local test clusters for use by the Grid School students.

---++ Checklist of tasks for all hosts
Here are the steps that were performed on each host
   1. Make a /share directory
<pre class="screen">
mkdir /share
</pre>
   1. Link /home to /share/home
<pre class="screen">
rm -rf /home
ln -s /share/home /home
</pre>


---++ Checklist of tasks for CE/NFS hosts
   1. Make directories for NFS export
<pre class="screen">
mkdir /export
mkdir /export/home   
mkdir /export/condor 
mkdir /export/osg   
mkdir /export/certificates 
</pre>
   1. Make /etc/exports for NFS export
<pre class="screen">
/export/home   192.168.109.0/24(async,no_root_squash,rw)
/export/condor 192.168.109.0/24(async,no_root_squash,rw)
/export/osg    192.168.109.0/24(async,no_root_squash,rw)
/export/certificates   192.168.109.0/24(async,no_root_squash,rw)
</pre>
   1. Start NFS
<pre class="screen">
chkconfig --level 345 nfs on
/etc/init.d/nfs start
</pre>
   1. Link export directory into /share:
<pre class="screen">
cd /share
ln -s /export/certificates
ln -s /export/osg
ln -s /export/home
ln -s /export/condor
</pre>
   1. Follow directions at the ClusterCondorInstall document, for Head Node

---++ Checklist of tasks for Interactive hosts
   1. Make directories for NFS mounts
<pre class="screen">
mkdir /share/home   
mkdir /share/condor 
mkdir /share/osg   
mkdir /share/certificates 
</pre>
   1. Set up NFS mounts in /etc/fstab, by adding the following and replace gs-ce1 with the CE number you're working on (gs-ce2, gs-ce3, etc)
<pre class="screen">
gs-ce1:/export/condor         /share/condor     nfs     udp,bg,intr,noatime
gs-ce1:/export/home           /share/home       nfs     udp,bg,intr,noatime
gs-ce1:/export/osg            /share/osg        nfs     udp,bg,intr,noatime
gs-ce1:/export/certificates   /share/certificates nfs   udp,bg,intr,noatime
</pre>
   1. Follow directions at the ClusterCondorInstall document, for Interactive Node

The description of the steps of this Install procedure (including the commands and options required) that will have to be performed each time this is installed.

---++ Checklist of tasks for SE hosts
   1. Make directories for NFS mounts
<pre class="screen">
mkdir /share/home   
mkdir /share/condor 
mkdir /share/osg   
mkdir /share/certificates 
</pre>
   1. Set up NFS mounts in /etc/fstab, by adding the following and replace gs-ce1 with the CE number you're working on (gs-ce2, gs-ce3, etc)

gs-ce1:/export/osg            /share/osg        nfs     udp,bg,intr,noatime
gs-ce1:/export/certificates   /share/certificates nfs   udp,bg,intr,noatime
</pre>
   1. Install Bestman from Bestman

---++ Checklist of tasks for GUMS hosts
   1. Create /opt directory
<pre class="screen">
mkdir /opt
tar zxvf 
</pre>

---++ Checklist of tasks for Worker Nodes
   1. Make directories for NFS mounts
<pre class="screen">
mkdir /share/home   
mkdir /share/condor 
mkdir /share/osg   
mkdir /share/certificates 
</pre>
   1. Set up NFS mounts in /etc/fstab, by adding the following and replace gs-ce1 with the CE number you're working on (gs-ce2, gs-ce3, etc)
