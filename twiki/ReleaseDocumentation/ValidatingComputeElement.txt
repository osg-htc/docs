---+Introduction
      The Compute Element Validating Procedure is done in the final stages of preparing a major OSG
Software Release.  As part of this there are a number of functionalities that need to be validated.  Typically a 
validation table is made with a column for each of the tests below and a row for each Trash/Trash/Integration site that is being
tested.

---+About this Document
    Each section of this document provides instructions on how to test functionality of one of the services that
runs on the Compute Element.
