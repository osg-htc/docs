---++ Introduction to GIP Configuration

This section gives information about the options in the GIP, Subcluster*, and SE* sections of the configuration file.

_Note for seasoned admins_:  This section has undergone a *significant amount of revision*; the latest update has introduced a new way to configure subclusters and SEs.  The old-style configuration will still work, but is deprecated.  *We strongly recommend updating your config to the new style.*  Once this is done, note that the GIP section itself has very few options left.

---+++ Notes for multi-CE sites.

If you would like to properly advertise multiple CEs per cluster, make sure that you:
   * Set the value of cluster_name in the [GIP] section to be the same for each CE.
   * Set the value of other_ces in the [GIP] section to be the hostname of the other CEs at your site; this should be comma separated.  So, if you have two CEs, ce1.example.com and ce2.example.com, the value of other_ces on ce1.example.com should be "ce2.example.com.  This assumes that the same queues are visible on each CE.
   * Set the value of site_name in the "Site Information" section to be the same for each CE.
   * Have the *exact* same configuration values for the GIP, SE*, and Subcluster* sections in each CE.

It is good practice to run "diff" between the config.ini of the different CEs.  The only changes should be the value of localhost in the [DEFAULT] section and the value of other_ces in the [GIP] section.

---++ GIP Section Options

The options given in bold type are mandatory.

%EDITTABLE{  header="| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation |" format="| text, 30 | text, 25 | textarea, 2x50 |"  changerows="on" quietsave="on" editbutton="Edit table" }%
| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation |
| advertise_gums | =True=, =False= | Defaults to False. If you want GIP to query and advertise your gums server set this to True. |
| advertise_gsiftp | =True=, =False= | Defaults to True.  If you don't want GIP to advertise your gridftp server set this to False. |
| gsiftp_host  | String | This should be set to the name of the gridftp server GIP will advertise if the advertise_gridftp setting is set to True. |
| cluster_name | String | This should *only* be set if you run multiple gatekeepers for the same cluster; if you do, set this value to the FQDN of the head node of the cluster. |
| other_ces| String | This should *only* be set if you run multiple gatekeepers for the same cluster; if you do, set this value to the comma-separate list of FQDNs for the other CEs at this site. |

---++ GIP Subcluster Configuration

Each homogeneous set of worker node hardware is called a *subcluster*.  For each subcluster in your cluster, fill in the information about the worker node hardware by creating a new Subcluster section with a unique name in the following format:  =[Subcluster CHANGEME]= where CHANGEME is the globally unique subcluster name (yes, it must be a *globally* unique name for the whole grid, not just unique to your site.  Get creative).

*At least one subcluster section* is required; please populate the information for all your subclusters.  For WLCG sites, information filled in here will be advertised as part of your !MoU commitment, so please strive to make sure it is correct.  The information needed is:

%TABLE{ tableborder="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" headerbg="#99CCCC" databg="#FFFFCC, #FFFFFF" valign="top" }%
%EDITTABLE{  header="| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation " format="| text, 30 | text, 25 | textarea, 2x50 |"  changerows="on" quietsave="on" editbutton="Edit table" }%
|Option|Values Accepted|Explanation |
|*name*|string|This is the same name that is in the Section label.  It should be *globally unique*|
|*node_count*|Positive Integer|This is the number of worker nodes in the subcluster|
|*ram_mb*|Positive Integer|Megabytes of RAM per node.|
|*cpu_model*|String|CPU model, as taken from /proc/cpuinfo.  Please, no abbreviations!|
|*cpu_vendor*|String|Vendor's name: AMD, Intel, or ??|
|*cpu_speed_mhz*|Positive Integer|Approximate speed, in MHZ, of the chips|
|*cpus_per_node*|Positive Integer|Number of CPUs (physical chips) per node.  Usually 1 or 2|
|*cores_per_node*|Positive Integer|Number of cores per node.  Usually 4 or 8|
|*inbound_network*|True, False|Set to true or false depending on inbound connectivity.  That is, external hosts can contact the worker nodes in this subcluster based on their hostname.|
|*outbound_network*|True, False|Set to true or false depending on outbound connectivity.  Set to true if the worker nodes in this subcluster can communicate with the external internet.|
| *cpu_platform* | x86_64, i686 | This option indicates the cpu platform. |

[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/InformationServices/SubclusterMapping][This page shows the mapping from these attribute names to GLUE attribute names]]

---++ GIP SE Configuration

For each storage element, add a new section called =[SE_CHANGEME]= where CHANGEME is the name of your SE.  Each SE name must be unique for the entire grid, so make sure to not pick anything generic like "MAIN".  Each SE section must start with the words "SE", and cannot actually be named "CHANGEME".

SE configuration can be a bit tricky.  We provide [[InformationServicesSEConfig][a few examples here.]]

---+++ Generic SE

We first outline the configuration for a generic SE, then have additional comments for !BestMan and dCache SEs.  *For WLCG sites to be advertised correctly, they _must_ use the bestman or dcache19 provider.*:

%TABLE{ tableborder="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" headerbg="#99CCCC" databg="#FFFFCC, #FFFFFF" valign="top" }%
%EDITTABLE{  header="| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation " format="| text, 30 | text, 25 | textarea, 2x50 |"  changerows="on" quietsave="on" editbutton="Edit table" }%
|Option|Values Accepted|Explanation|
|*enabled*|Boolean|True/False Indicates whether or not this SE section is enabled for the GIP.|
|*name*|String|Name of the SE as registered in OIM.|
|*srm_endpoint*|String|The endpoint of the SE.  It MUST have the hostname, port, and the server location (such as /srm/v2/server).  It MUST NOT have the ?SFN= string.  Example:  srm://srm.example.com:8443/srm/v2/server |
|*provider_implementation*|String|Set to *static* for a generic SE; we recommend !BestMan sites use the *bestman* implementation and dCache sites use *dcache* or *dcache19*.  See notes below|
|*implementation*|String|Name of the SE implementation.|
|*version*|String|Version number of the SE implementation.  Some provider implementations will attempt to auto-detect this.|
|*default_path*|String|Default storage paths for the VOs; VONAME is replaced with the VO's name.|
|vo_dirs|Comma-separated string|A comma-separated list of VONAME:PATH pairs; the PATH will override the *default_path* attribute for VONAME.|
|allowed_vos|Comma-separated list of VOs|By default, all VOs are advertised as having access to your SE.  If you want only a subset of VOs to be advertised, list them here|

---++ !BestMan and dCache notes

For !BestMan-based SEs, there are a few additional comments to make and extra options:

%TABLE{ tableborder="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" headerbg="#99CCCC" databg="#FFFFCC, #FFFFFF" valign="top" }%
%EDITTABLE{  header="| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation " format="| text, 30 | text, 25 | textarea, 2x50 |"  changerows="on" quietsave="on" editbutton="Edit table" }%
|Option|Values Accepted|Explanation|
|*srm_endpoint*|String|The endpoint of the SE.  It is most likely of the form srm://srm.example.com:8443/srm/v2/server.|
|*provider_implementation*|String|Set to 'bestman'|
|*implementation*|String|Set to 'bestman'|
|*version*|String|Version number; the "bestman" provider implementation will attempt to auto-detect this also.|
|*use_df*|True, False|Set to True if the bestman provide can use 'df' on the directory referenced above to get the freespace information.  If set to false, it probably won't detect the correct info.  Use this if !BestMan writes into a file system which is mounted on your head node (such as xrootdfs, IBRIX, or GPFS).|
The !BestMan provider will use srm-ping to query your !BestMan instance for information.  This means that the user *daemon* will need to read a valid hostcert in */etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem* and hostkey in */etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem*.  !BestMan server does not require any authorization to perform srmPing, so you do not need to change anything on your SRM server.

For dCache-based SEs:

%TABLE{ tableborder="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" headerbg="#99CCCC" databg="#FFFFCC, #FFFFFF" valign="top" }%
%EDITTABLE{  header="| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation " format="| text, 30 | text, 25 | textarea, 2x50 |"  changerows="on" quietsave="on" editbutton="Edit table" }%
|Option|Values Accepted|Explanation|
|*srm_endpoint*|String|The endpoint of the SE.  It is most likely of the form srm://srm.example.com:8443/srm/managerv2.|
|*provider_implementation*|String|Set to 'dcache' for dcache 1.8 (additional config is required), 'dcache19' for dcache 1.9, or 'static' for default values.   If you use the dcache provider with dCache 1.8, see [[InformationServices/DcacheGip][this page to complete installation]].  If you use the dcache19 provider, you must fill in the location of your dCache's information provider|
|*infoprovider_endpoint*|String|Url to the dcache information provider.  Only necessary for the dcache19 provider.|
|*implementation*|String|Set to 'dcache'|
|*version*|String|dCache version; non-static providers will also attempt to auto-detect this.  This should be the version from the output of "rpm -q dcache-server".|
|*srm_host*|String|This most likely does not need editing.  If your SRM endpoint has multiple aliases, the GIP might get confused when resolving the IP addresses given by dCache.  This setting will force the selection of a specific hostname.|
dCache version 1.9 added a new read-only XML information service which feeds the dcache19 provider.  The location of the info provider is most likely:
<verbatim>
http://dcache_head_node.example.com:2288/info
</verbatim>
It runs on the same node that the dcache web interface does.  Check your dCache documentation on how to enable the info service if that link does not work.

Since dCache 1.8 does not have a machine-readable information service, the "dcache" provider must access it through the admin interface; [[InformationServices/DcacheGip][this process is documented here]].  Some site admins consider this a security concern.


---+++ SE Space configuration.
Both the dCache and !BestMan providers have a concept of a logical storage grouping, or space.  You can control how the space access is advertise through adding options to the SE's section.  For dCache, a space may be one of several dCache concepts:
   * A link group is a space, if link groups are configured.
   * A pool group is a space.
If a pool group is inside a link group, only the link group will be advertised.  The space name is the name of the link group or pool group.

For !BestMan, a space is a SRM space token.  The name of the space is the space token description.

The following space-related options are valid; replace NAME with the space's name:

%TABLE{ tableborder="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" headerbg="#99CCCC" databg="#FFFFCC, #FFFFFF" valign="top" }%
%EDITTABLE{  header="| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation " format="| text, 30 | text, 25 | textarea, 2x50 |"  changerows="on" quietsave="on" editbutton="Edit table" }%
|Option|Values Accepted|Explanation|
|spaces|Comma-delimited list|Comma-delimited list of all the spaces that should be restricted by VO|
|space_NAME_vos|Comma-delimited list of VOs|By default, all VOs are allowed to access all spaces.  If you would like to change this for a specific space, "NAME", this should be a comma-delimited list of VOs allowed to access NAME.|
|space_NAME_default_path|String|The default storage path for VOs for the space NAME.  As in the "default_path" option, the word VONAME is evaluated to be the VO's name.|
|space_NAME_path|Comma-delimited list|A list of VONAME:PATH pairs for this space; works like the SE's vo_dirs variable.|

These options are not required for !BestMan or dCache.  Both providers will attempt to guess the correct values for spaces, but are not always perfect.

---++ No SE - Publish CE to SE Bindings for external SE
In very rare cases, a site may not host an SE, but have an agreement with another site to share or otherwise use their SE.  For this use case, edit gip.conf in $VDT_LOCATION/gip/etc (create if not present).  Make sure the following lines are present:
<verbatim>
[cesebind]
simple=False
se_list=SE1.example.com,SE2.example.com,...
</verbatim>
The se_list is a comma delimited list of SE Unique ID's as configured at the external site.  Usually, the SE unique ID is set to the full hostname of the SRM endpoint.

---++ Example Configurations for SE's and Subclusters
Examples taken from working installations of the new style Storage Element and Subcluster sections can be found at ConfigurationFileGIPExamples.
