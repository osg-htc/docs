WARNING! This page is for an older version of Hadoop.
For newer versions, please visit [[Documentation/Release3.InstallHadoopSE][Hadoop Release 3 Installation]]
%ENDCOLOR%


This tutorial covers the installation of a SE based on [[ReleaseDocumentation/Hadoop][Hadoop]] and [[ReleaseDocumentation/Bestman][BeStMan-gateway].  At the end of this tutorial you will be able to use [[https://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-wg/doc/SRM.v2.2.html][SRM]] to copy files into and out of the SE, access files through a local file system mount, and know how to add more storage space to Hadoop.

For more detailed information on each of the components, see the references at the bottom of this document.

---++Requirements

   * The participants will need to have a minimum of three servers and root access on both servers, but four or more is ideal.  
   * All servers should have a single public IP address. 
   * All servers must have the OS be SL4 or newer.
   * All servers must have the fuse kernel module and fuse userspace packages installed. Some instructions about this are below.
   * All servers must have Sun Java 1.6 installed. 
   * A working gums service is required for user mappings on the [[ReleaseDocumentation/GsiFtpStandAlone][GridFTP server]]; grid-mapfile mappings are not currently supported. The gums service will also be used by the !BeStMan server.
   * The operation of !BeStMan requires a valid service certificate. If you are planning to support access to your SE by LCG-Utils tools this certificate must be the copy of the host certificate. Otherwise, use a valid service certificate. 

There will be four servers referred to in the below tutorial.  The examples will use the following hostnames:
   * *NameNode* (namenode.host): This will host the Hadoop !NameNode and will serve the meta-data for the Hadoop file system.  This must have at least 4GB of memory.
   * *Secondary !NameNode* (secondary.host): This server will host the Hadoop Secondary !NameNode and acts as a backup and fail-over for the !NameNode.  This server can be omitted if necessary, though it is highly discouraged.
   * *DataNode* (datanode.host): This server will host the Hadoop !DataNode of the Hadoop file system. The actual data will be housed on this server. 
   * *SRM* (srm.host): The !SRM server will have the !BestMan service to act as the SRM Endpoint.  It will also host the !GridFTP server to serve as a gsiftp endpoint.  If you only have three servers, these can be run on the Secondary !NameNode.

---++ Installation Procedure

---+++ Install Hadoop

*Hadoop should be installed on the !NameNode, Secondary !NameNode, and !DataNode.  The SRM server will also need hadoop installed in order for a Hadoop (HDFS) fuse mount point*


Run the following as the root user:
<pre class="rootscreen">
rpm -ivh http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/osg-hadoop-1-2.el5.noarch.rpm
yum install hadoop
</pre>

Configure Hadoop by editing  ==/etc/sysconfig/hadoop==.  In general, you should be able to use an identical copy of ==/etc/sysconfig/hadoop== on all of your nodes.  The specific settings that you will want to change are listed below.  Descriptions of the settings are in the configuration file itself, and also here:  https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage/HadoopInstallation#Edit_etc_sysconfig_hadoop

<pre class="file">
HADOOP_NAMENODE
HADOOP_REPLICATION_DEFAULT
HADOOP_SECONDARY_NAMENODE

HADOOP_DATA

HADOOP_USER (optional if you want a different user besides "hadoop")
HADOOP_GANGLIA_ADDRESS (only if using ganglia)
HADOOP_NAMENODE_HEAP (optional, for memory tuning)

%ENDTWISTY%

Start Hadoop on the !NameNode first, then on the !Datanode second, and finally on the Secondary !NameNode using the same set of commands on each:
<pre class="rootscreen">
service hadoop-firstboot start
chkconfig hadoop on
service hadoop start
</pre>
*Note: you do not need to start Hadoop on the SRM server.*

---+++ Accessing Hadoop with Client Commands

*Note: At this point, you will need to logout and login again in order to pick up profile and environment changes.  If you do not, you will get JAVA_HOME and HADOOP_CLASSPATH related errors when using client commands.*


At this point you should be able to point your web browser at =http://%RED%namenode.host%ENDCOLOR%:50070/= and see your !NameNode status page and a single !Datanode.    Double-check the capacity of the !Datanode to make sure it is reasonable.  If the capacity is not right, you may need to edit ==/etc/hadoop/hadoop-site.xml== and change =dfs.datanode.du.reserved= to the size that you wish to reserve for hadoop DFS.

You can also copy files into and out of HDFS using the native hadoop commands, such as:

<pre class="rootscreen">
hadoop fs -mkdir /osg
hadoop fs -chown 777 /osg
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /etc/hosts /osg/hosts.txt
</pre>

Verify that the file was copied with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
hadoop fs -ls /
</pre>

---+++ Accessing Hadoop with fuse mount

Before you can use the POSIX fuse mount, you need to install the appropriate packages:
   * Fuse kernel module:  For newer kernels, this module is included in the kernel already.  To check, use the command ==lsmod== or run ==modprobe fuse==.
   * Fuse libraries: ==rpm -qa | grep fuse-libs== should return something similar to "fuse-libs-2.7.4-8_10.el5.x86_64" (your version/architecture may differ).
   * Fuse userspace tools: ==rpm -qa | grep fuse== should return something similar to "fuse-2.7.4-1.el3.rf.x86_64" (your version/architecture may differ).  Also, the file ==/sbin/mount.fuse== should exist.

Once fuse is installed, you can install the hadoop fuse package with:
<pre class="rootscreen">
yum install hadoop-fuse
</pre>

Now you can try mounting the POSIX fuse mount for hadoop by adding the following to ==/etc/fstab==
<pre class="rootscreen">
hdfs# /mnt/hadoop fuse server=%RED%NameNode.host%ENDCOLOR%,port=9000,rdbuffer=32768,allow_other 0 0
</pre>

Now mount the filesystem with:
<pre class="rootscreen">
mkdir -p /mnt/hadoop
mount /mnt/hadoop
</pre>

If you are having problems with fuse, you can also mount the filesystem manually with:
<pre class="rootscreen">
nohup /usr/bin/hdfs  /mnt/hadoop -o rw,server=%RED%NameNode.hostname%ENDCOLOR%,port=9000,rdbuffer=131072,allow_other -d &
</pre>

At this point you should be able to ls, cat, cp, and rm files in ==/mnt/hadoop==.  Verify that the file you copied earlier with the native hadoop commands appears in the POSIX fuse mount. 


---+++ Install !GridFTP

If you are installing on four or more servers, the !GridFTP service will be installed on the SRM node.  If you are using three nodes, the SRM node will be combined with the Secondary !NameNode server, and !GridFTP will be installed on this node.

<pre class="rootscreen">
rpm -ivh http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/osg-hadoop-1-2.el5.noarch.rpm
yum install gridftp-hdfs
</pre>

Verify that you have modified ==/etc/sysconfig/hadoop== appropriately (see above).  

Set your gums hostname in ==/etc/grid-security/prima-authz.conf==:  
<pre class="file">
imsContact https://%RED%your.gums.host:8443%ENDCOLOR%/gums/services/GUMSAuthorizationServicePort
</pre>

Now configure hadoop and restart xinetd so that it recognizes the new service.
<pre class="rootscreen">
service hadoop-firstboot start
service xinetd restart
</pre>

At this point you should be able to use globus-url-copy to copy files into and out of HDFS.  From a host with the osg client installed, run the following after replacing ==srm.host== with the hostname of the !GridFTP server:
<pre class="screen">
globus-url-copy file:////etc/hosts gsiftp://%RED%srm.host%ENDCOLOR%:2811/osg/junk.txt
</pre>

Now use the hadoop commands on any of your hadoop nodes to verify the file:

<pre class="rootscreen">
hadoop fs -ls /osg
hadoop fs -cat /osg/junk.txt
</pre>

---+++ Install !BeStMan SRM

The !BeStMan service will be installed on the *SRM* server if you are using four or more servers.  If you are using three nodes, the SRM node will be combined with the Secondary !NameNode server, and !GridFTP will be installed on this node.  This service uses a UNIX account to run as.  By default, this is the "bestman" user.

The operation of !BeStMan requires a valid service certificate. If you are planning to support access to your SE by LCG-Utils tools this certificate must be the copy of the host certificate. Otherwise, use a valid service certificate. This certificate needs to be owned by the bestman user.  This certificate will be assumed to be under ==/etc/grid-security/http== and will be owned by the bestman user.

Since we are installing !BeStMan on the same node as !GridFTP, we don't have to install the =osg-hadoop= setup package again and can proceed directly with the installation of !BeStMan.  Make sure to fix the ownership of your http cert/key pair after !BeStMan is installed:

<pre class="rootscreen">
yum install bestman hadoop-fuse
chown -R bestman: /etc/grid-security/http
</pre>

Make sure the POSIX fuse mount is available, following the directions above.

You should now modify your !BeStMan configuration in =/opt/bestman/conf/bestman.rc= to point to your !GridFTP server, set the allowed list of paths that !BeStMan can access, and point to your gums server.  For the ==GUMSCurrHostDN==, fill out the DN from your service certificate.
<pre class="rootscreen">
supportedProtocolList=gsiftp://%RED%srm.host%ENDCOLOR%:2811
GUMSserviceURL=https://%RED%your.gums.host:8443%ENDCOLOR%/gums/services/GUMSAuthorizationServicePort
GUMSCurrHostDN=%RED%/DC=org/DC=YOUR_ORG/OU=YOUR_OU/CN=CN_FROM_BESTMAN_SERVICE_CERT%ENDCOLOR%
localPathListAllowed=/mnt/hadoop
</pre>

You also need to run =visudo= to update the =/etc/sudoers= file with settings to allow !BeStMan to access files in HDFS.  By default, this is the ==bestman== account.  Add the following to the end of this file, and comment out the line that reads =Defaults  requiretty=

<pre class="file">
#Defaults  requiretty

Cmnd_Alias SRM_CMD = /bin/rm, /bin/mkdir, /bin/rmdir, /bin/mv, /bin/ls 
Runas_Alias SRM_USR = ALL, !root 
bestman ALL=(SRM_USR) NOPASSWD:SRM_CMD
</pre>

Now you can start the !BeStMan service with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
service bestman start
</pre>

At this point you should be able to use srmcp and srm-copy to copy files into and out of Hadoop.  (The following assumes that you have created the "osg" directory with the client commands above).
<pre class="screen">
srmls -2 srm://%RED%srm.host%ENDCOLOR%:8443/srm/v2/server?SFN=/mnt/hadoop/osg
srmcp -2 file:////etc/hosts srm://%RED%srm.host%ENDCOLOR%:8443/srm/v2/server?SFN=/mnt/hadoop/osg/junk2.txt
srm-copy file:////etc/hosts srm://%RED%srm.host%ENDCOLOR%:8443/srm/v2/server?SFN=/mnt/hadoop/osg/junk3.txt
</pre>

Congratulations!  You now have a working SE using Hadoop/HDFS and !BeStMan Gateway.
