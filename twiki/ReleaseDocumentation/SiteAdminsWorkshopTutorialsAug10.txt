---++ Introduction

This is a repository of information for the OSG site administrator's workshop held at the Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education (ACCRE) of the Vanderbilt University, August 10-11, 2010.   
   * Meeting homepage in OSG Indico system is [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=3429][here]],  [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=3429][agenda]].
   * Planning and organization: SiteCoordination.SiteAdminsWorkshopAug2010
   * Suggest format for hands-on guides [[HandsOn][here]], for example: ClientInstallationHandsOn.

---++ General Requirements
These apply to both the OSG site administrators and the CMS Tier 3 workshops.

Attendees should already have a valid grid certificate. Attendees should install an OSG 1.2 Grid client ([[ClientInstallationHandsOn][OSG client installation]]), specially if they plan to attend the Network session or to test grid resources. Information about certificates is available [[Documentation.GetAccessToGrid][here]].  Attendees will work with their own servers which should have pre-installed certificates. GUMS and CE installations will require one server each (it can be the same if you are just testing) with a platform [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported by VDT]].  You will need admin (root) privileges.  

---++ OSG and Tier 3s (Marco Mambelli)
This session presents an overview of OSG 1.2, VDT 2.0 and introduces some OSG concepts and the Tier 3 idea to newcomers.  This will be followed by a presentation of key security concepts.

Attendees will receive a brief description of the hands-on sessions.

---++ OSG Security (Igor Sfiligoi)
Give an introduction about certificates, CA, CRLs, trusted relationships on OSG.

Instruct on security best practices for site administrators.

---++ GUMS (Steve Timm)
The GUMS installation will show how to install a single GUMS server using the normal OSG Release Documentation.  We will also cover simple administration tasks of GUMS such as adding a new group.  
For GUMS hands on you need 1 machine real or virtual, a http cert, 2GB RAM, ~10GB disk. 
   * GUMSHandsOn


---++ Compute Element (Suchandra Thapa)
*CE Installation* walk through, then one on one tutoring/problem solving.
   * ComputingElementHandsOn
*Requirements* This session requires participants to have a server and root access to the server.  The system should have an full access to the internet and about 5GB of space available.  In addition, you should have a personal certificate and server, http, and rsv certificates as well.


---++ Network performance and troubleshooting (Jason Zurawski)
*Description:* Hands-on workshop will introduce the participants to network performance tools, and suggest strategies to locate and quickly resolve problems.  Emphasis will be placed on the use of diagnostic tools available in VDT including [[http://www.internet2.edu/performance/owamp/][OWAMP]], [[http://www.internet2.edu/performance/bwctl/][BWCTL]] and [[http://www.internet2.edu/performance/ndt/][NDT]] as well as introducing the concept of regular monitoring through the use of the [[http://psps.perfsonar.net][perfSONAR-PS]] framework.  

*Requirements:* Workshop exercises will be performed on a specially designed testbed accessed from the participants laptop.  Participants will need to have a laptop with a web browser and a terminal capable of connecting to remote resources via SSH.  Plugins for Flash and Java for the web browser will be required to view some of the web content.  

*Hands-on Section*

*Agenda:*
   * Welcome and Introductions (*5 Mins*)
   * Network Performance Primer - Why Should We Care? (*15 Mins*)
   * Getting the Tools (*10 Mins*)
   * Use of the BWCTL Server and Client (*30 Mins*)
   * Use of the OWAMP Server and Client (*30 Mins*)
   * Use of the NDT Server and Client (*30 Mins*)
   * BREAK (*15 mins*)
   * Diagnostics vs Regular Monitoring (*30 Mins*)
   * Network Performance Exercises (*1 hr 30 Mins*) 

---++ Storage Element Installation: !BeStMan - gateway (Tanya Levshina)
*Description:* !BeStMan-gateway hands-on will demonstrate how to install !BeStMan from OSG cache and how to configure it in gateway mode to satisfy most common Tier-3 requirements. The tutorial will also provide instructions for the gratia gridFTP transfer probe enabling and configuration.  

*Requirements* The participants will have to have a server and root access to the server. The system should have an full access to the internet.  In addition, you should have a personal certificate and server certificates as well.  If you are doing test  installation you should not worry about disk space that will be used as a storage area, but for actual installation some reasonable disk space (~1 TB?) is needed.  

*Hands-on guides:* BeStManGatewayHandsOnGuide


---++ Storage Element Installation: !BeStMan and Hadoop (Michael Thomas)
*Hands-on guides:*  HadoopInstallationHandsOn  Participants are encouraged to be familiar with Hadoop and the installation process from the official OSG Hadoop twiki page: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage/Hadoop

*Requirements* The participants will need to have a minimum of two servers, but preferably three or four, and root access on all servers.  All servers should have a single public IP address.  All servers must have the fuse kernel module and fuse userspace packages installed.  All servers must have Sun Java 1.6 installed.  A working gums service is required for user mappings; grid-mapfile mappings are not currently supported. One server will run the Hadoop !DataNode, one will run the Hadoop Namenode, one will run the Hadoop Secondary Namenode, and one will run the Bestman and Gridftp processes.  The BestMan+GridFTP server must have a valid host or service certificate installed in /etc/grid-security/{hostcert.pem,hostkey.pem} (for gridftp) and /etc/grid-security/http/{httpcert.pem,httpkey.pem} (for BestMan).

Slides for the talk can be found here:

http://unlhepcl.unl.edu/cl/Talk_slides.pdf

---+++ CRAB (Eric Vaandering)
*Hands-on guide:* HandsOnCRAB

*Requirements*

*CMS VO Membership* In addition to a certificate from a valid authority (likely DOEGrids), your certificate must identify you as part of the CMS VO. The registration process can be time-consuming (actions by several people are required), so it is important to start it as soon as possible. Use the following link for this: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/CRABPrerequisitesGRIDCredentials Make sure you follow any additional instructions for US-CMS users. To verify that this is done correctly, please issue the commands below on your exported certificate. These commands must be issued somewhere where a Grid UI is installed, such as the FNAL LPC, CERN's lxplus, etc. 
<pre>
voms-proxy-init -voms cms
voms-proxy-info -all | grep -Ei "role|subject"
</pre>
and make sure you see a response like this:
<pre>
subject   : /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Eric Vaandering 123456/CN=proxy
subject   : /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Eric Vaandering 123456
attribute : /cms/Role=NULL/Capability=NULL
attribute : /cms/uscms/Role=NULL/Capability=NULL
</pre>
If you do not have the first attribute line listed above, you have not completed the VO registration and you must complete it before continuing. 

*FNAL LPC account* While we will attempt to install CRAB on your local machine, obtaining an account at FNAL on the interactive cluster there will ensure you can complete the exercises. Please follow the instructions here: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/WorkBookRemoteSiteSpecifics#FermiLab

*SiteDB registration* You should be registered as an individual in !SiteDB. This is different than the site registration you did earlier.  Please follow the instructions at [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SiteDBForCRAB][SiteDB registration for CRAB]]
