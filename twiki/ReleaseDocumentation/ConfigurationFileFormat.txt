---++ About this Document
%ICON{hand}% This document is intended for system administrators and presents a reference to the syntax and structure of the ini configuration files used by various OSG configuration tools, most notably =configure-osg=.

%BR%

---++ General Layout

The configuration file used by configure-osg is similar in format to the ini configuration file used by windows.  Long lines can be split up using continuations as specified in RFC 822.  A config file is separated into sections with each section starting with a section name in square brackets (e.g. =[Section 1]=) .  Lines that begin with a =;= or a =#= are treated as comments and ignored.  Options can be set using either =name : value= or =name=value= pairs.  Finally, variables and variable subsitutions are supported.

---++ Variables and variable substitution
The configure-osg parser allows variables to be defined and used in the configuration file.  Any option set in a given section can be used as a variable in that section.  Note, this means that you will need to be careful when naming variables in order to avoid an infinite loop when resolving the variable substitution.  Assuming that you have set an option with the name =myoption= in the section, you can substitute the value of that option elsewhere in the section by referring to it as =%(myoption)s= .  Please note that the trailing =s= is required.  Also the variable substitution will only occur when setting an option, so option names can not have a variable substitution in them.

---++ Default Section
The config file also supports a special section labeled as =[Default]= .  Any option defined in this section can be referenced as a variable at any point in the file.  In the sample =config.ini= file, this section is used to define the =enable=, =disable=, =unavailable= variables as well as some variables that may be handy throughout the configuration file.
