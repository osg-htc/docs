%ICON{hand}% This document is for System Administrators and Grid Users. It contains a brief description of errors occurring during job submissions to a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%.

%STARTINCLUDE%

%STARTSECTION{"GramErrors"}%
---%SHIFT%+ Globus Gram Client Errors

There may be several reasons causing a client side error condition. These are a list of the known ones.

---%SHIFT%++ Error Code 47

The grid user is authorized to submit a job to %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%, but the assigned Unix account does not exist on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run cms-xen1.fnal.gov:2119/jobmanager-fork /bin/date
GRAM Job submission failed because the gatekeeper failed to run the job manager (%RED%error code 47%ENDCOLOR%)
</pre>

The GRAM log file on the Compute Element =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/globus-gatekeeper.log= will contain an entry indicating the missing Unix account:

<pre class="file">
TIME: Tue Feb 27 09:51:34 2007
 PID: 16564 -- Failure: getpwname() failed to find uscmspool591
</pre>

---%SHIFT%+ Globus GRAM-WS Client Errors

---%SHIFT%++ Error Code 200

The grid user is authorized to submit a job to %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM_WS%, but the =/etc/sudoers= file is misconfigured on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globusrun-ws -submit -F cms-xen1.fnal.gov:9443 -Ft Fork -c /bin/date
Submitting job...Done.
Job ID: uuid:5d85bb28-c67c-11db-ac3b-00163e010001

globusrun-ws: Job failed: %RED%Error code: 200%ENDCOLOR%
Sudo is misconfigured to run the globus-job-manager-script.pl script for user uscmspool591.
ERROR: Job FAILED with return code (255)
</pre>

The GRAM-WS log file on the Compute Element =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/container.log= will contain an entry:

<pre class="file">

     Job ee6b5450-c67b-11db-8fab-bf5150c2cbdd accepted for local user 'uscmspool591'

     exec.StateMachine [RunQueueThread_15,createFaultFromErrorCode:3264] 
     Unhandled fault %RED%code 200%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

The misconfiguration is likely associated with first entry in the =/etc/sudoers= file which is associated with authorizations for the globus-ws container user:

<pre class="file">
%UCL_CWD%/globus/libexec/globus-job-manager-script.pl *
</pre>

---%SHIFT%++ Error Code 201

The grid user is authorized to submit a job to %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM_WS%, but the assigned Unix account does not exist on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%:

</pre>

---%SHIFT%++ Invalid File Permissions on STDOUT

The grid user is authorized to submit a job to %LINK_GLOSSART_GRAM_WS%, but the =/etc/sudoers= file is misconfigured on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%. The error will only occur when output is _streamed_ back to the client as either stdout/stderr or in the form of a file:

<pre class="screen">

starter: the job manager failed to open stdout
ERROR: Job FAILED with return code (255)
</pre>

The GRAM-WS log file on the Compute Element =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/container.log= will contain an entry:

<pre class="file">

 "/fd40d51c-c67c-11db-ae39-00163e010001.0.stdout"
<b>.... followed by a java stacktrace.....</b>
</pre>

The misconfiguration is likely associated with _second_ entry in the =/etc/sudoers= file which is associated with the processing of the delegated proxy for the globus-ws container user:

<pre class="file">
%UCL_CWD%/globus/libexec/globus-gram-local-proxy-tool *
</pre>

%NOTE% After the =/etc/sudoers= file is corrected, a restart of the =globus-ws= container will be required to effect the change.
