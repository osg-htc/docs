---+ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for System Administrators who are planning to install !GridFTP server on a designated node to achieve better load balancing for your !BeStMan installation.
This document applies to the latest release %RED% OSG-%OSG_VERSION% %ENDCOLOR%. All procedures presented in this document in general require _root_ privileges.

---++Introduction

<div id="indent">
The !BeStMan server is using !GridFTP server to transfer files to/from any Posix compliant file system.The !GridFTP package contains components necessary to set up a stand-alone gsiftp server and tools used to monitor and report its performance.
A stand-alone !GridFTP server might be used under the following circumstances:
   * A simple front-end to a filesystem allowing access over WAN - for example NFS.
   * [[BeStMan][BeStMan]] is capable of distributing its workload among several gsiftp servers so if you expect large movements of data into/out of your site, multiple gsiftp servers can be set up.
</div>


---+++!!Engineering Considerations

<div id="indent">
It is recommended that the !GridFTP package be installed on its own server if:
   * You are serving the VOs that use storage heavily (CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0) and have more than 250 cores
   * Your site will be managing more than 50 TB of disk space
</div>

If you are planning to have a Storage Element with !BeStMan and have more
than 1Gbps bandwidth, then you should plan on at least one !GridFTP server
per 4Gbps of available bandwidth (assuming you have 10Gbps interfaces on the
server) if you want to maximize throughput. 
</p>

You have to decide what authorization mechanism do you prefer. You may use either grid-mapfile or !GUMS server for users’ authentication and authorization. More details about !GUMS could be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS GUMS Installation Guide]]. %BR% %BR% We currently recommend using GUMS as it provides superior flexibility and allows a site to manage all of its mappings in one central location; most large sites use GUMS.
---+++ How to get Help?

If a problem occurs during installation or verification of the service, see [[#DebugInfo][Debugging Information]].

If you cannot resolve the problem, the best way to get help is by following  [[HelpProcedure][this page]]. 

---++ Requirements

   1. [[PacmanInstall][pacman]] version >=%PACMAN_VERSION% is required
   1. The server must have a fully qualified domain name and a valid [[GetHostServiceCertificates][grid host certificate]] installed in =/etc/grid-security/=. 
   1. The firewall must allow incoming connections to the gsiftp port (default 2811). Outgoing connections must be allowed from high ports ( typically in range 32769-65535 ). We recommend to consult the [[ComputeElementFirewalls][Firewall Guide]] if you install the !GridFTP server for the first time.
   1. A working GUMS server or a gridmap-file are needed for authorization using grid certificates.

---++Installation Procedure
Login as root and check if pacman version >=%PACMAN_VERSION% is installed:
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;PACMAN3.28_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
pacman -version
</pre>

Next create and change to an installation directory. This directory, referred here as ==VDT_LOCATION==, will later be used to get the !GridFTP package  from the %CACHE% cache.
<pre class="screen">
mkdir -p /opt/osg/osg-%OSG_VERSION%-gsiftp/
cd /opt/osg/osg-%OSG_VERSION%-gsiftp/
</pre>

If you are using GUMS authorization method you will need to setup _VDT_GUMS_HOST_ environment variable, if you are using  gridmap-file ,please, proceed to the next step.
<pre class="screen"> 
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
export VDT_GUMS_HOST=&lt;GUMS hostname&gt;  
</pre>

Finally execute pacman to get the !GridFTP package from the %CACHE% cache. Pacman will ask whether you want to trust the cache (=yall=) and whether you want to accept the license (=y=).
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get %CACHE%:GridFTP
</pre>

The install procedure will print out a warning:
<verbatim>
========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.
</verbatim>

%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall" section="InstallACertificateAuthorityPackage"}%
---++ Post-Install Procedure

To finalize your installation you must run the =vdt-post-install= program on the command line:

<pre class="rootscreen">
vdt-post-install
</pre>

You can verify that the version installed is the version you expected by executing =vdt-version=. To see all services available use =vdt-control -list=
<pre class="screen">
vdt-version
vdt-control --list
</pre>

This completes the installation of the !GridFTP server. Move to the next step to configure the server.

---++ Service Configuration

If you don't have to worry about firewall please go to [[#GridftpConfig][GridFTP Configuration section]]. If you are dealing with firewall the gridftp port range should be properly set.
In order to do so you will have to modify _vdt-local-setup.sh_.
<pre class="file">
<verbatim>
#edit $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=<low_port,high_port>
GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=<low_port,high_port>
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
</verbatim>
</pre>

Where _low_port,high_port_ - is the ports range that is allowed for all outbound globus connections for gridftp (e.g GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=40000,49150). See [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementFirewalls#iptables_for_RHEL_or_compatible][Firewall Guide]]  for more information how to modify iptables.

If you are using GUMS authorization method, please, copy the following two files from _$VDT_LOCATION/post-install_ to in _/etc/grid-security_, otherwise skip this step: 
 <pre class="screen">
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/prima-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gsi-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
</pre>

You will need to make sure that users have write permission in to the storage area.  

#GridftpConfig
---+++ Gratia !GridFTP Transfer Probe Configuration

If you would like to collect and report to Gratia file transfer statistic you have to enable and configure Gratia !GrdFTP transfer probe  and perform the actions described in
 [[GratiaTransferProbe][Preparing, Installing and Validating Gratia transfer probe]]


---++ Enabling the Services

You can use the _vdt-control -list_ command to see all services that are installed as part of the install, and whether or not they are enabled or disabled. 
You will need to enable the following services:
   * fetch-crl   
   * vdt-rotate-logs  
   * vdt-update-certs       
   * gsiftp           
   * gratia-gridftp-transfer  %ICON{warning}% In case you want to run Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe
   * gums-host-cron   %ICON{warning}% In case you want to run Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe and are using !GUMS for authorization
   * edg-mkgridmap     %ICON{warning}% In case you want to generate and/or update gridmap-file and use it  for authorization 

You can execute _vdt-control -enable_ command and list all services you want to enable:
<pre class="screen">
<verbatim>
cd <VDT_LOCATION>
source setup.sh
vdt-control -enable fetch-crl vdt-rotate-logs vdt-update-certs gsiftp
</verbatim>
</pre> 

If you are using !GUMS or have gridmap-file and don't want to use automatically generated one, please, skip this section:
<pre class="screen">
<verbatim>
cd <VDT_LOCATION>
source setup.sh
vdt-control -enable edg-mkgridmap
edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap
</verbatim>
</pre> 
---++ Service Startup/Shutdown

The operation of !GridFTP requires a set of the services you have just enabled to be executed periodically as a cron jobs. gsiftp server requires =/etc/services= and =/etc/inetd.conf= to be changed. All these operation can be done by using =vdt-control= that makes the necessary changes to =inetd= and =cron=: 

<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --on
</pre>

To stop services and revert the changes simply execute:

<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --off
</pre>

Please note that on some unix systems =xinetd= instead of =inetd= will be used.
The detailed description of all the options available to start/stop services could be found [[ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices][here]].

---++ Validation of Service Operation
---+++ Self-testing with globus-url-copy command

To validate the operation of the !GridFTP server use the =globus-url-copy= client to transfer a file.
In order to do so you have to have access to your certificate and private key and create a proxy certificate (_grid-proxy-init_ or _voms_proxy_init_ command).
   * Login on the node you have installed !GridFTP as "yourself"
   * Setup location of !BeStMan installation
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
</pre>
   * Make sure that you have access to your certificate and private key on that node, you will need it to create a proxy certificate. Execute grid-proxy-init:
<pre class="screen">
grid-proxy-init
Your identity: .....
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
</pre>

Then create a file and copy it into another file using ==globus-url-copy== command:
<pre class="screen">
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/zero.source bs=1k count=1024

> globus-url-copy file:///tmp/zero.source gsiftp://yourhost.yourdomain/tmp/zero
> echo $?
0

> globus-url-copy gsiftp://yourhost.yourdomain/tmp/zero file:///tmp/zero.destination
> echo $?
0

> diff /tmp/zero.source /tmp/zero.destination 
> echo $?
0

</pre>

Verify that the [[GratiaTransferProbe#Sanity_Check][gratia probe is working]].
