---++ About This Document
The OSG Certificate Authority Distribution contains information about Certificate Authorities (CAs) in use in OSG.  

---++ CA Caches
There are now three locations from which CA certificates can be downloaded (CA-Certificates-Updater):
   * OSG: This distribution is maintained by the OSG security team and contains *OSG recommended* CAs. This cache currently has four sub caches with osg-recomended, and igtf-only CAs and locations for both old and new CA hash formats (for supporting openssl 1.0 transition)
      * OSG: This cache includes IGTF accredited CAs plus few unaccredited CAs added at the request of one or more OSG VOs. It is a new format CA distribution (includes md5 and sha1 hash to support openssl 0.9.x and 1.0)
      * OSG-compat: This cache includes IGTF accredited CAs plus few unaccredited CAs added at the request of one or more OSG VOs. It is a legacy format CA distribution (includes only md5  hash and suitable for openssl 0.9.x only)
      * IGTF: This cache includes only IGTF accredited CAs. It is a new format CA distribution (includes md5 and sha1 hash to support openssl 0.9.x and 1.0)
      * IGTF-compat: This cache includes only IGTF accredited CAs. It is a legacy format CA distribution (includes only md5  hash and suitable for openssl 0.9.x only)
   * ITB: This location is maintained by the OSG security team and is intended for ITB testing only and *should not* be used for production. As in production ITb cache also has four subcaches ITB, ITB-compat, ITB-IGTF, ITB-IGTF-compat.

%WARNING% Production services on OSG should *NOT* install (or reference via yum or apt) the ITB
version of the CA distribution since it may, at times, contain an untrustworthy CA certificate for testing purposes!%ENDCOLOR%
