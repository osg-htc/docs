---++ Introduction
See Trash.Trash/IntegrationCertScripts for information about all this.


---++ Example user certificate request & retrieval

   * Setup the osg-client: <pre>
source /opt/client/setup.sh
</pre>
   * Then follow the instructions in Trash.IntegrationCertScripts  (=cert-request --ou p=, and answer questions). When it asks you to input your sponsor's name, email, phone, use me as your sponsor:<pre>
input your email address: rwg@uchicago.edu
input your complete phone number: 312-804-0859
input your sponsor's name: Rob Gardner
input your sponsor's email address: rwg@uchicago.edu
input your sponsor's phone number: 312-804-0859
</pre>
   * Then, for the registration authority, choose OSG:<pre>Choose a registration authority to which you are affiliated.
If nothing else applies, pick OSG.
_Enter__this____for this registration authority
	ANL	 Argonne National Lab
	ESG	 Earth System Grid
	ESnet	 DOE Science network
	FNAL	 Fermilab host and service certificates
	FusionGRID	 National Fusion Collaboratory Project
	LBNL	 Berkeley Lab
	LCG	 LHC Computing Grid Catchall
	NERSC	 computer center
	ORNL	 Oak Ridge National Lab
	OSG	 Open Science Grid (choose this if nothing else applies)
	PNNL	 Pacific Northwest National Lab
(choose from left column): OSG</pre>
   * And for the VO, choose OSGEDU.
   * You'll get an email when its approved, with a serial number (eg. 37709)
   * Then retrieve it with: =cert-retrieve --serialnum 37709 --p12 usercert.p12=

---++ PKCS12 format
   * If you did not user the =--p12= option with the =cert-retrieve= command you can still generate a PKCS12 format file with the openssl command.
   * You'll need a version of your certificate to insert into your browser.
   * Do this: =openssl pkcs12 -export -in usercert.pem -inkey userkey.pem -out usercert.p12=
   * Import the =usercert.p12= into your browser


---++ Example host and http service certificate request
   * Here is a (dryrun) example to request a host certificate (courtesy Steve Timm):
<verbatim>
$ cert-request --dryrun --agree --ou s --name "Steven C Timm" \
      --host gc1-ce --email timm@fnal.gov --phone 630-840-8525 \
      --reason "Colombia Grid School" --affiliation osg --vo osgedu -dir .
</verbatim>
   * Remove the =-dryrun= and then the cert request will be submitted.
   * To request an  httpd service, add =--service http=.

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
Why is this document even there. Is it designed to be an example common usecase invocation for the cert-request command. 
I would recommend removing this page.
We should probably include contents from it as an example in [[CertificateGetCmd]]
