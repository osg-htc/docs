---+ About this Document
%STARTSECTION{"AboutBestman"}%
%ICON{hand}% This document is for Storage System Administrators. It contains the installation procedure for a %LINK_BESTMAN% in [[BeStMan#FullMode][%BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode]]. This document applies to the latest release %RED% OSG-%OSG_VERSION% %ENDCOLOR%.

%ENDSECTION{"AboutBestman"}%

---+ Introduction

%STARTSECTION{"IntroductionGeneric"}%
%LINK_BESTMAN% is a generic [[https://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-wg/doc/SRM.v2.2.html][SRM v2.2]] load balancing front-end for transfer servers and disk-based storage systems. It was developed by the [[https://sdm.lbl.gov/][Scientific Data Management Group]] at [[http://www.lbl.gov][Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]].

%BESTMAN% works on top of any disk-based POSIX-compliant file-systems. It is known to work on file systems such as NFS, GPFS, PVFS2, GFS, Ibrix, HFS+, Hadoop, !XrootdFS and Lustre and integrates with various file transfer services, such as gsiftp, http, https, bbftp and ftp.
%ENDSECTION{"IntroductionGeneric"}%

#FullMode
%BESTMAN% in %BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode is fully compliant with SRM v2.2. It provides support for the dynamic management of the available storage space and queuing of SRM requests. It can be configured to support Mass Storage Services (MSS). If you are not planning to use dynamic space management, request queuing and not interested in MSS support you should consider to install [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGateway][BeStMan-gateway]] instead.

%STARTSECTION{"MoreInfo"}%
For general information on storage software architecture, implementations and use, please read [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/StorageInfrastructureSoftware][on storage infrastructure software]]. For information on planning, installing and validating storage software see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/StorageSiteAdministrator][here]].
%ENDSECTION{"MoreInfo"}%

---+ Engineering Considerations

%STARTSECTION{"EngineeringConsiderationsPart1"}%

%BESTMAN% requires at least one node with following components to be installed: 
   * %BESTMAN% implements SRM v2.2 
   * !GridFTP server 
   * [[GratiaTransferProbe][Gratia gridftp transfer probe]] (optional) - a cron job reporting file transfers to the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaSiteCollector][Gratia collector]]
%ENDSECTION{"EngineeringConsiderationsPart1"}% 
  
%STARTSECTION{"EngineeringConsiderationsPart2"}% 
Please answer following questions before you proceed with installation and configuration of %BESTMAN%-%BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode storage element: 

   $ Q. _What authorization mechanism do you prefer?_ : Decide between a grid-mapfile or a [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][GUMS]] server for authorization. %BR% We recommend to use GUMS as the most flexible solution; most large sites use GUMS.

   $ Q. _How many !GridFTP servers you will need?_: Choose to run multiple !GridFTP servers for load balancing and better performance. We recommend to install additional !GridFTP servers if your Storage Element: 
   * is serving data to more than 250 cores for VOs that use storage heavily (e.g. CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0)
   * is managing more than 50 TB of disk space
   * has more than 1Gbps bandwidth: plan on at least one !GridFTP server for each 4Gbps of available bandwidth to maximize throughput 

   $ Q. _Do you need to enable Gratia gridftp-transfer probes?_ : The Gratia gridftp-transfer probes provide OSG storage statistics for accounting purposes. More details can be found at the  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/WebHome][Gratia Home Page]]. The reports include the source and destination of transfers, certificate subject of transfer initiator, as well as the size and status of the transferred file. %BR% The probe needs to be installed on every !GridFTP server which may be different from your %BESTMAN% server.
%ENDSECTION{"EngineeringConsiderationsPart2"}% 


   $ Q. _What kind of storage do you like to provide to your users?_: Choose between a *volatile cache* (files are stored for a fixed amount of time), a *custodial cache* (files are stored until deleted) or provide *both*. You can also allow users to write to storage areas that are outside the storage space managed by %BESTMAN%.


%STARTSECTION{"GetStorageHelp"}% 
---+ How to get Help?

   * see the [[#DebugInfo][debugging section]] below for problems installing or operating the storage element
   * follow [[HelpProcedure][this procedure]] if you can't resolve the problem
   * contact the developers at osg-storage@opensciencegrid.org or srm@lbl.gov
%ENDSECTION{"GetStorageHelp"}% 

%STARTSECTION{"Requirements"}% 

---+ Requirements

   1. all procedures in this document require _root_ privileges
   1. the installation procedure requires %LINK_PACMAN% version >= %PACMAN_VERSION% to be installed
   1. you will need at least 1 server to install the software
   1. the extended internet daemon [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinetd][xinetd]] must be installed and running on the server
   1. the operation of %BESTMAN% requires a valid service certificate. If you are planning to support access to your SE by [[ReleaseDocumentation.LcgUtilities][LCG-Utils tools]] this certificate *must* be the copy of the host certificate (see [[#Verify_the_BeStMan_Certificate][this section]] for details). Otherwise use a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates#Request_a_Service_Certificate][service certificate]].
   1. the service certificate must be owned by the Unix user that is running %BESTMAN%
   1. the firewall must allow incoming connections to the %BESTMAN% ports (default:10080,10443)
   1. the firewall must allow incoming connections to the !GridFTP port (default 2811)
   1. outgoing connections must be allowed from high ports ( typically in range 32769-65535 ). We recommend to consult the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementFirewalls][Firewall Guide]] if you install the !GridFTP server for the first time.
   1. Grid users will authenticate with your site using their grid certificates. The users have to be authorized in order to access your SE. You'll need to determine the authorization mode you wish to use before you can proceed with installation(see [[ReleaseDocumentation/AboutAuthorizationForCE][for details]]). 
   1. the server must have a fully qualified domain name and a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates#Request_a_Host_Certificate][host certificate]] installed in =/etc/grid-security=
%ENDSECTION{"Requirements"}% 

%STARTSECTION{"Installation"}%
---+ %BESTMAN% Installation Procedure 

The installation procedure consists of the following steps:

   1 verify the operation of =xinetd=
   1 verify the service certificate for %BESTMAN%
   1 create an installation directory
   1 use %LINK_PACMAN% to install %BESTMAN%
   1 [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GetHostServiceCertificates#Setup_Initial_Certificate_Author][install the CA Certificates and the Certificate Revocation List]]
   1 execute the post installation script 

---++ Verify Xinetd Status

The !GridFTP service will be started by the =xinetd= service on connection requests. Please verify that =xinetd= is running:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /etc/init.d/xinetd status
%RED%xinetd (pid xxxx) is running...%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

Otherwise consult the documentation provided with your operating system to find out how to install =xinetd=.

---++ Verify the %BESTMAN% Service Certificate

By default %BESTMAN% is using the certificate and key installed in =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem= respectively.  If you don't require support for !LCG-Utils simply proceed to [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates#Retrieve_and_Install_the_Service][request and install a service certificate]].

%WARNING% In order to handle requests from !LCG-Utils, %BESTMAN% must be configured to use a copy of the host certificate as its service certificate. This is mandatory for all %BESTMAN% servers supporting the ATLAS experiment. Also some grid users are using [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/LcgUtilities][lcg-utils]] to access the SE. 

There are two ways to solve this problem:

   1. If you don't have a service certificate installed in =/etc/grid-security/http=, simply copy the host certificate to the location of the service certificate:

<pre class="rootscreen">
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$mkdir -p /etc/grid-security/http
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$cp /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$cp /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$chown -R %RED%user.group%ENDCOLOR% /etc/grid-security/http
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$chmod 600 /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem
</pre>
 
   2. If you have a service certificate installed in  =/etc/grid-security/http= already, create a new sub-directory and copy the host certificate to this location:

<pre class="rootscreen">
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$mkdir -p /etc/grid-security/bestmancert
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$cp /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem /etc/grid-security/bestmancert/bestmancert.pem
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$cp /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem /etc/grid-security/bestmancert/bestmankey.pem
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$chown -R %RED%user.group%ENDCOLOR% /etc/grid-security/bestmancert
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$chmod 600 /etc/grid-security/bestmancert/bestmancert.pem  /etc/grid-security/bestmancert/bestmankey.pem
</pre>

%NOTE% =user= and =group= must correspond to the Unix account used to run %BESTMAN%!

%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall" section="CreateInstallationDirectory"}%

---++ Use Pacman to Install %BESTMAN%

Next, we will use %LINK_PACMAN% to install %BESTMAN% into the current working directory (=%UCL_CWD%=).

If you are using the [[InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][Grid User Management System (GUMS)]] as a Grid Identity Mapping Service, you will need to define the =$VDT_GUMS_HOST= environment variable first. Otherwise skip this step. 

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% export VDT_GUMS_HOST=%RED%&lt;your GUMS hostname&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

To download  the %BESTMAN%  package from the %CACHE% cache execute the =pacman= command. Pacman will ask whether you want to "trust the caches and accept the license", answer =yall= and =y= to install the %BESTMAN% package:
 
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Bestman
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Bestman
Do you want to add [http://software-itb.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): yall
Beginning VDT prerequisite checking script vdt-common/vdt-prereq-check...        

All prerequisite checks are satisfied.
                                             

========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.
%ENDTWISTY%
</pre>



Please check the installation log file =%UCL_CWD%/vdt-install.log= for errors if the installation failed. Otherwise proceed.

%STARTSECTION{"CAInstallation"}%
<!-- instructions to install and enable CA Certificates and the CRL -->
---++ Install a Certificate Authority Package

You will need to install a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CA% package. For more information and options see [[ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall#Install_a_Certificate_Authority][this document]].

%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall" section="LocalInstallation" INPUT_SCREEN="rootscreen"}%

%ENDSECTION{"CAInstallation"}%
%STARTSECTION{"PostInstall"}%
---++ Run the Post-Install Script

At last run the =vdt-post-install= script to finish the installation:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-post-install

Done.
</pre>

This completes the installation of the %BESTMAN% server. Move to the next section to configure the %BESTMAN%-%BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode and !GridFTP server. You may also choose to configure the Gratia transfer probe at this time (see [[#Engineering_Considerations][this section]] for detailed explanation).

If you want to install additional !GridFTP servers on the different nodes, please follow [[GsiFtpStandAlone][this document for !GridFTP server installation]]. See [[#Engineering_Considerations][this section]] for reasoning. 

%ENDSECTION{"PostInstall"}%

---+ %BESTMAN% Configuration

You will first need to configure %BESTMAN% in order to enable it as a service. The configuration process is controlled by the %BESTMAN% configuration script ( =$VDT_LOCATION/bestman/setup/configure= ). The full list of %BESTMAN% configuration options is provided by the [[http://sdm.lbl.gov/bestman/docs/bestman-guide.html][Bestman Administrative Guide]].

---++ Default Configuration

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% %UCL_CWD%/vdt/setup/configure_bestman --server y
</pre>

This command will configure %BESTMAN% using following defaults:

   * run %BESTMAN% using Unix account =daemon=
   * use certificate =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= and key =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem=
   * listen on secure port =10443= and public port =10080=
   * assume gridftp server is running on the same server listening on port =2811=
   * use grid-mapfile for authorization

---++ Configure using GUMS

<pre class="rootscreen">
<code>%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT%$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_bestman --server y \</br>
        --gums-host %RED%&lt;hostname of GUMS server&gt;%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --gums-port %RED%&lt;port of GUM server&gt;%ENDCOLOR%</code>
</pre>

This command will configure %BESTMAN% using following settings:

   * run %BESTMAN% using Unix account =daemon=
   * listen on secure port =10443= and public port =10080=
   * assume gridftp server is running on the same server listening on port =2811=
   * use GUMS for authorization

%NOTE% Please, see [[#Requirements][Requirements]] and [[#Verify_Service_Certificate_for_B][Verify Service Certificate]] section for more details.

---++ Configure Volatile Storage (Optional)

Volatile storage limits the lifetime of stored data. After the storage lifetime of the data expired, the file will be deleted.

<pre class="rootscreen">
<code>--volatile-file-lifetime %RED%&lt;maximum storage lifetime in secondes&gt;%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
--cache-size %RED%&lt;the size of volatile cache area in MB allocated for storage&gt;%ENDCOLOR% \</br></code>
</pre>

---++ Configure Custodial Storage (Optional)
 
If you want to create a custodial storage place where files could be stored unless they are explicitly deleted by user you will need to add the following options to the configuration above:

<pre class="rootscreen">
<code>--with-custodial-storage-path %RED%&lt;path to custodial storage&gt;%ENDCOLOR% /</br>
--with-custodial-storage-size %RED%&lt;size of custodial storage in MB&gt;%ENDCOLOR%</code>
</pre>

Additionally you may want to either _allow_ or _block_ access to certain storage paths, but not both:

<pre class="rootscreen">
<code>--with-allowed-paths  %RED%&lt;semicolon separated list of allowed storage paths&gt;%ENDCOLOR%</code>
</pre>

<pre class="rootscreen">
<code>--with-blocked-paths  %RED%&lt;semicolon separated list of blocked storage paths&gt;%ENDCOLOR%</code>
</pre>
 
%NOTE% By default =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/cache= will be used to store volatile data.

%WARNING% Keep in mind that %BESTMAN% will not be able to manage space in the areas specified in the list unless it is not also specified as custodial area.

---++ Complex Configuration
%STARTSECTION{"ComplexConfiguration"}%
Many more options are available to configure %BESTMAN% according to more specific requirements:

<pre class="rootscreen">
<code>%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt/setup/configure_bestman  --server y \</br>
        --user %RED%&lt;Unix user-name used to run BeStMan&gt;%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --cert %RED%&lt;location of bestman service certificate&gt;%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --key  %RED%&lt;location of bestman service key&gt;%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --gums-host %RED%&lt;hostname of GUMS server&gt;%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --gums-port %RED%&lt;port of GUM server&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
        --http-port %RED%&lt;public SRM port&gt;%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --https-port %RED%&lt;secure SRM port&gt;%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --globus-tcp-port-range %RED%&lt;low_port&gt;,&lt;high_port&gt;%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --volatile-file-lifetime %RED%&lt;maximum storage lifetime in secondes&gt;%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --cache-size %RED%&lt;the size of volatile cache area in MB allocated for storage&gt;%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --with-transfer-servers %RED%&lt;coma separated list of GridFTP servers&gt;%ENDCOLOR%</code>
</pre>

Where :
| *Argument Value* | *Default Value* | *Comment*| 
| ==user==| daemon | name of the non-privileged user that runs %BESTMAN% server process|
| ==bestman_service_cert==| /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem|is a path to service certificate|

|==low_port,high_port==|N/A| the open ports range that is allowed for all outbound globus connections for gridftp (see also how to deal with firewall in [[#GridFTP_Configuration][ in this section]])|
|==cache_size==|disk partition| the size of volatile cache area in MB allocated for storage|
|==lifetime==|30 minutes| the time in seconds that file stored in %BESTMAN% volatile cache will be available|

|==GridFTP_servers_list==|localhost| is a list !FQDN of your !GridFTP servers, separated by ; . e.g. “gsiftp://host1.domain.tld;gsiftp://host2.domain.tld”|
  
This command will allow you to configure %BESTMAN% that will manage a volatile space located under =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/cache directory=. The size of the area will be controlled by specified  =cache_size= or by size of the disk partition. The files that are stored at this area will be available ONLY during =lifetime= period.

%ENDSECTION{"ComplexConfiguration"}%

%STARTSECTION{"GridFTPConfiguration"}%
#GridFTP  
---++ !GridFTP  Configuration

!GridFTP server comes with %BESTMAN% installation and have to be configured if used with it GUMS authorization method.

If you are using GUMS authorization method, please, copy the following two files from ==$VDT_LOCATION/post-install== to  ==/etc/grid-security==. Otherwise go to the next [[#NextStep1][step]]: 
 <pre class="rootscreen">
<code>%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT%cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/prima-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT%cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gsi-authz.conf /etc/grid-security</code> 
</pre>


#NextStep1
If you have a firewall, the open port range for the gridftp should be properly set. In order to do so you will have to modify ==vdt-local-setup.sh== and ==vdt-local-setup.csh== files
<pre class="file">
<code>
#edit $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=%RED%low_port,high_port%ENDCOLOR%
GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=%RED%low_port,high_port%ENDCOLOR%
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE </code>
</pre>

Where ==low_port, high_port==  controls all outbound globus connections for gridftp (e.g 40000,49150). You should select the same range of ports you have selected during %BESTMAN%-%BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode configuration with  --globus-tcp-port-range %RED%low_port,high_port%ENDCOLOR% option.

You can have multiple installation of  !GridFTP servers located on  the nodes you have specified in %BESTMAN%-%BESTMAN_TYPE% mode configuration (see  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GsiFtpStandAlone][separate !GridFTP installation]] if you want to install it as a stand-alone server).

You will need to make sure that users have write permissions in to the storage area.  
%ENDSECTION{"GridFTPConfiguration"}%

%STARTSECTION{"GridFTPProbeConfiguration"}%
---+++ Gratia !GridFTP Transfer Probe Configuration

To enable and configure the Gratia !GrdFTP transfer probe for the !GridFTP server that comes with %BESTMAN% follow the instructions in

%ENDSECTION{"GridFTPProbeConfiguration"}%

%STARTSECTION{"EnableServices"}%

%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices" section="EnableService" INPUT_SERVICE="vdt-rotate-logs gsiftp gratia-gridftp-transfer (gums-host-cron|edg-mkgridmap)"}%

%NOTE% Please only choose =gums-host-cron= if you are using GUMS. If you want to generate local dynamic gridmap file choose =edg-mkgridmap= service instead.  If you are using existing gridmap file that has been already installed on your system, do not specify neither ==gums-host-cron== nor ==edg-mkgridmap== services.

If you have decided to use grid-map file for authorization and would like that it has been automatically generated for you do the following after you have enabled ==edg-mkgridmap== service :

---+ Trash/Trash/Integration with the information system

Trash/Trash/Integration of the SE with the central information systems takes place during the Compute Element installation/configuration. See the topic [[ReleaseDocumentation/GenericInformationProviders][Generic Information Providers]]. The SE does not collect or publish information independently.


---+ Validation of Service Operation
%STARTSECTION{"Testing"}%
---++ Site registration and daily monitoring

Once you have your SE setup and configured, you can register it with the [[http://datagrid.lbl.gov/sitereg/][LBNL SRM monitoring system]]. This will run daily tests against your SE and the results can be viewed [[http://datagrid.lbl.gov/osg/][here]].

---++ Self-testing with srm clients

In order to verify that the system is functional you will need to have access to srm client commands, be able to create a proxy certificate (==grid-proxy-init== or ==voms_proxy_init== command) and have access to your certificate and private key.

There are multiple ways of doing this.
%ENDSECTION{"Testing"}%
%STARTSECTION{"ClientInstall"}%
---+++ Preparing to run srm-client command on the %BESTMAN% node
If you don't have an access to the  node where [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][OSG Client]] is installed  you can still test %BESTMAN%.
   * Login on the %BESTMAN% node as "yourself"
   * Setup location of %BESTMAN% installation
<pre class="screen">
<code>source %UCL_CWD%/setup.sh</code>
</pre>

Make sure that you have access to your certificate and private key on that node. You will need it to create a proxy certificate. Execute grid-proxy-init :
<pre class="screen">
<code>grid-proxy-init
Your identity: .....
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:</code>
</pre>

You will need to add the path to all the srm client commands to your ==PATH== environment variable. 
<pre class="screen">
<code>export PATH=$PATH:$VDT_LOCATION/bestman/bin</code>
</pre>

---+++ Preparing to run srm-client command from the different node

 You may have an access to the node where OSG client is already installed and  where you have your certificate and key. If you want to install OSG Client use instructions  provided in [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][in that installation Guide]]. Then generate a proxy certificate by issuing ==grid_proxy_init== or _voms_proxy_init_:
<pre class="screen">
<code>source %RED%VDT_LOCATION%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh
grid-proxy-init
Your identity: .....
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:</code>
</pre>

or

<pre class="screen">
<code>source %RED%VDT_LOCATION%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh
voms-proxy-init -voms %RED%VO%ENDCOLOR%
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:</code>
</pre>
Where  ==VDT_LOCATION== is the directory where the client is installed and ==VO== name of your Virtual Organization.
%ENDSECTION{"ClientInstall"}%

---+++ Executing SRM-client commands 

After you create a proxy certificate, you may try to verify %BESTMAN%-%BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode with srm client commands:

Execute srm-ping: 
<pre class="screen">
 <code>srm-ping srm://%RED%BeStMan_host:secured_http_port%ENDCOLOR%/srm/v2/server

Please check that your ==gumsIDMapped== is not ==null==. If this is the case you have probably misconfigured your grid-mapfile or !GUMS related configuration.
If you have reasonable result you may try to srm copy. In order to do so create a file ==test== in ==/tmp== directory and write into the default volatile space:

If you turn on Gratia !GridFTP transfer probes, you should be able to see the accounting information by accessing your Gratia collector. See details in  [[GratiaTransferProbe][Preparing, Installing and Validating Gratia transfer probe]].
%STARTSECTION{"Troubleshooting"}%
---+ Troubleshooting
---++ File Locations

You could find log and configuration files for each of the module in the following location: 
| *Module Name* |  *Configuration files* | *Log files* | 
|%BESTMAN% | $VDT_LOCATION/bestman/conf/bestman.rc | $VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/event.srm.log<br/>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/bestman.log | 
|!GridFTP |$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/services/vdt-run-gsiftp.sh.env| $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp.log<br/> $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp-auth.log |

---++ Open Ports

The following ports are opened for the installed services
|*Module Name*|*Port Number*| *Protocol*|
|%BESTMAN%| default 10080| tcp|
||default 10443|tcp|
|!GridFTP|2811|tcp|
||lowPort,maxPort if needed to control outbound globus connections|tcp|  

#DebugInfo

---++ Debugging Procedure
If  system validation failed, you would probably need to check the each component in order 
to verify your installation. In order to do so you should check all of them in the following order: 
   * !GUMS (if in use) 
   * !GridFTP 
   * %BESTMAN% 

---+++ Verifying !GUMS 

Make sure that the service certificate you specified for %BESTMAN%  configuration with  
==--cert service_cert== , ==--key service_key==  options and !GridFTP service certificate are 
accepted by !GUMS  (see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][GUMS Installation Documentation]])   
 
Get mapping ==uid== for your certificate and verify that this ==uid== exists on %BESTMAN% and !GridFTP node. 
 
---+++ Verifying !GridFTP 

Login on the node where you have installed have your certificate installed and  access to %CACHE%:wn_client or  %CACHE%:client.

You will need to get your ==voms-proxy== or ==grid_proxy== certificate see [[Validation of Service Operation][this section]] : 

Then test !GridFTP: 
<pre class="screen">
<code>source %RED%VDT_LOCATION%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh 
echo “This is a test” >/tmp/test 
globus-url-copy -dbg file:///tmp/test gsiftp://%RED%GridFtp_host%ENDCOLOR%/tmp/test 
</pre>

Check the !GridFTP logs if you have encountered any errors.

---+++ Verifying %BESTMAN%-%BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode

First, make sure that %BESTMAN% is running: 
<pre class="screen">
# ps auxww|grep $VDT_LOCATION/bestman|grep -v grep
daemon   27648  0.0  0.0  4944 1168 pts/2    S    07:46   0:00 /bin/sh /usr/local/osg-bestman/bestman/sbin/bestman.server
daemon   27676  3.3  7.4 715240 155208 pts/2 Sl   07:46   1:59 /usr/local/osg-bestman/jdk1.6/bin/java -server -Xmx512m -Dorg.globus.tcp.port.range=20000,25000 -DX509_CERT_DIR=/usr/local/osg-bestman/globus/TRUSTED_CA -Daxis.ServerConfigFile=/usr/local/osg-bestman/bestman/conf/server-config.wsdd gov.lbl.srm.server.Server /usr/local/osg-bestman/bestman/conf/bestman.rc
</pre>

If %BESTMAN% is not running check information in that log files ==$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log== and  ==$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/bestman.log==.

There is no error in the log file (==$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/event.srm.log==)
