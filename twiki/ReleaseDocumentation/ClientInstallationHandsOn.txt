---++Introduction
=OSG-client= is the package provided by OSG for user interaction with the Grid: it allows to initiate the proxies and provides the clients to use Compute Elements and Storage Elements.
It can be installed as root for all the users in the system or by regular users for personal consumption.

Root installation of the client, both using Pacman and RPM packages, is covered in detail by the OSG release documentation:
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallOSGClient][Installing OSG client using RPM]] (new release candidate)
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][Installing OSG client using Pacman]] (OSG 1.2)

This page presents a short version of the installation and covers mainly the personal installation.
OSG supports multiple Unix shells. The examples in this page use =sh= (=bash=). For =csh= or other shells see the referenced documentation.

Other hands-on guides are available at HandsOn.

---++Requirements
=OSG-client= requires for you to have one of the many VDT supported platforms (see the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][VDT requirements]]), network connection and about 1.2 GB of disk space available. To use the Grid you will need also your [[ReleaseDocumentation.CertificateUserGet][Grid Certificate]].

To install OSG client using RPM you need also a RHEL5 based OS (Centos 5 or SL5 are OK) and root access to the machine.

---++ Installing OSG Client using RPM
We assume that you are familiar with the basics of package management in a RHEL OSG, specially the use of =rpm= and =yum= commands. If not please check the referenced documentation.

---+++ Add the package repositories
OSG software is distributed via the OSG yum repositories. Some packages depend on packages distributed via the [[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL][EPEL]] repositories. Both need to be enabled to install OSG RPMs.
   1. If not already present, install the package to use the EPEL repository: <pre class="rootscreen">
wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
rpm -i epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm </pre>
   1. Install the OSG repositories: <pre class="rootscreen">
rpm -Uvh http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/repos/3.0/el5/testing/x86_64/osg-release-3.0-3.noarch.rpm </pre>

*WARNING*: enabling new repositories may add new packages or change the version of packages that you may get from other repositories
       
*WARNING*: if you have your own mirror or configuration of the EPEL repository, you *MUST* verify that it contains the latest packages from EPEL and that the OSG repository has a better yum priority than EPEL.  Otherwise, you will have strange deploying issues.

---+++ Install OSG client
  1. Install the osg-client meta package, which will pull in all dependencies. <pre class="rootscreen">
yum install --enablerepo=osg-testing --nogpgcheck osg-client   </pre>

---++ Installing OSG Client using Pacman
---+++Getting Pacman
%LINK_GLOSSARY_PACMAN% is a package management used by OSG.
OSG 1.2 requires Pacman 3.28 or later. If you have an earlier version or no Pacman, you need to [[PacmanInstall][install Pacman]]:
<pre class="screen">
wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-3.28.tar.gz
tar --no-same-owner -xzvf pacman-3.28.tar.gz
cd pacman-3.28
source setup.sh
</pre>

---+++Installing OSG-client

It is recommended to install OSG-client in a local file system (on shared ones the installation may fail due to load). In the example I will use =/scratch/=, a local directory with write access to regular users

<pre class="screen">
source /scratch/pacman-3.28/setup.sh 
mkdir /scratch/osg-client
cd /scratch/osg-client
pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client
</pre>
Answer =yall= when asked to trust the caches (you will trust al the caches used in the installation).

The installation should complete with something like:
<pre class="screen">
Beginning VDT prerequisite checking script vdt-common/vdt-prereq-check...       

All prerequisite checks are satisfied.

========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.

The VDT version 2.0.0 has been installed.
                                         
The OSG Client package OSG version 1.2 has been installed.

More information about installing and using OSG-client is available in the ClientInstallationGuide

More information on available commands and how to use the OSG Client can be found in the ClientUseHandsOn and the [[ReleaseDocumentation.ValidateClients][CE and Client validation section]] both referenced below.

---++Client use

If you installed OSG client using Pacman, each time you want to use the client you must source the setup file (e.g. =source /opt/client/setup.sh=).
A Pacman installation is a sandbox not affecting your default system environment.

If you installed OSG client using RPM, all the commands will be in your path ready to be used.

Here is a brief presentation placing the OSG client within the Grid stack and introducing the [[ClientUseHandsOn][end user tutorial]] that was presented during the March 09 OSG All Hands meeting.
In the ClientUseHandsOn tutorial you will find useful information and examples of basic commands that you can run once you install the OSG client.
