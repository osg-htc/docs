---++ About this Document
This document shows the installation of the Virtual Organization Membership Service, %LINK_VOMS%, service.  This service is used to maintain the membership of the VO, and also to manage attributes for users.

This document is intended to be only a portion of the larger [[ReleaseDocumentation.VomsInstallGuide][VOMS Installation Guide]].

---++ Requirements
   1 verify that your Operating System is [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported]]
   1 a %LINK_PACMAN% installation of version %PACMAN_VERSION% or later
   1 Installation must be done as root.
   1 allow inbound and outbound network connection _to all GUMS servers that may query this VOMS_

---++ Installation package
Setup %LINK_PACMAN%:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cd <i>PACMAN_DIR</i>
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% source setup.sh
</pre>

---++ Create the Installation Directory
Create an empty installation directory and change into it. 
Here we'll call it =voms=, created under  =/usr/local/osg=. 

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir -p %UCL_CWD%
</pre>

%WARNING% You can install VOMS in any arbitrary directory. Please don't directly use a system directory like =/opt= or =/usr= here. The installation routine will create many sub-directories in the install directory chosen.

---++ Installation using Pacman
In the next step we will use the =pacman= command line tool to install the package from the OSG software cache. %LINK_PACMAN% will ask whether you want to "trust the caches and accept the license", answer =yall= and =y= to install VOMS.

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cd %UCL_CWD%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get  %CACHE%:voms
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
Full output with questions:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get  http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:voms
Do you want to add [http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): yall
Beginning VDT prerequisite checking script vdt-common/vdt-prereq-check... 

All prerequisite checks are satisfied.
...                                                                          


========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.
</pre>

The above line should be the last line of output you see.  The version number of the tarball may be different than that shown above.  Do not be concerned with this.
%ENDTWISTY%

If you saw no errors and Pacman created some _setup_ files, then the first part of the installation completed successfully. 

---++ Update the Environment

Depending on your shell update your environment by sourcing =%UCL_CWD%/setup.sh= or =%UCL_CWD%/setup.csh=:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% source %UCL_CWD%/setup.sh
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-post-install 
Starting...
Done.
</pre>


<!-- How to install and handle CA Certificates and the CRL on storage and worker nodes:

---++ Starting VOMS
With this release all services are initially disabled so you will have to enable them manually as follows:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cd %UCL_CWD%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% source setup.sh
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --enable fetch-crl
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --enable vdt-update-certs
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --enable vdt-rotate-logs
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --enable mysql5
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --enable apache
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --enable tomcat-55
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --enable voms 
</pre>
%NOTE% The voms service will not exist until you have created the VO.

In order to turn the VOMS services on, you have to perform the following action:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cd %UCL_CWD%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% source setup.sh
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --on
enabling cron service fetch-crl... ok
enabling cron service vdt-rotate-logs... ok
enabling cron service vdt-update-certs... ok
enabling init service mysql5... ok
enabling init service apache... ok
enabling init service tomcat-55... ok
enabling init service voms... ok
</pre>

%NOTE% Technically now you have a running VOMS server but very little will work until you complete the configuration steps (below). Specially the following:
      * define a VOMS administrator
      * create a VO and add some users
      * allow read-only access to your VO
