OSG 3.6 News
============

!!! danger "Upcoming OSG 3.6 end-of-support dates"
    OSG 3.6 reaches the "End of Regular Support" on March 31, 2024 and will only receive critical bug-fix and
    security updates until its end-of-life on June 30, 2024.
    See our [Release Series documentation](./release_series.md#series-life-cycle) for more details.

    Note that the OSG 3.6 end-of-life coincides with the wider Enterprise Linux 7 end-of-life.
    **We recommend upgrading to OSG 24 and an Enteprise Linux 9 distribution at your earliest convenience.**

**Supported OS Versions:** EL7, EL8, EL9

The OSG 3.6 release series is a major overhaul of the OSG software stack compared to previous release series with
changes to core protocols used for authentication and data transfer:
bearer tokens, such as [SciTokens](https://scitokens.org/) or WLCG tokens, are used for authentication instead of
GSI proxies and HTTP is used for data transfer instead of GridFTP.

To support these new protocols, OSG 3.6 includes HTCondor 9.0, HTCondor-CE 5, GlideinWMS 3.9, and XRootD 5.4.
We also dropped support for the GridFTP, GSI authentication, and Hadoop.

Known Issues
------------

The following issues are known to currently affect packages distributed in OSG 3.6:

### Preparing for HTCondor 10.0 ###

We have released HTCondor version 10.0 into the OSG repositories.

!!! note
    The `condor-upgrade-checks` RPM version 10.0.5 works with existing HTCondor 9.0.x installations.
    It can be installed with either HTCondor version 9 or 10.

HTCondor-CE and HTCondor pool administrators should install the `condor-upgrade-checks` RPM and run the
`condor_upgrade_check` script to check for actions that need to be
taken before upgrading to HTCondor version 10. This script checks for three
possible issues:

-   HTCondor upgrade causing a change in `TRUST_DOMAIN` which would invalidate existing IDTOKENS
-   Recent and current GPU jobs that will no longer match, because the new `require_gpus` `condor_submit` command must be used for GPU matching
-   HTCondor map files that have regular expressions that the new PCRE2 library will not accept

To check your Access Point configuration run:

    :::console
    root@access-point # condor_upgrade_check

To check your Compute Entrypoint configuration run:

    :::console
    root@htcondor-ce # condor_upgrade_check -ce

!!! note
    Don't forget to check to HTCondor batch system as well


For more information, consult the HTCondor documentation

### CA Certificates on EL9 ###

EL9 operating systems have a tighter default cryptographic policy that can cause services to reject certificates issued
by SHA-1 signed CAs.
Some CAs in the `igtf-ca-certs` and `osg-ca-certs` packages are affected and you may see service issues if your server
certificate or certificates presented by clients are issued by these CAs.
The Software Team is investigating solutions but in the meantime, we recommend running the following command on XRootD
hosts to accept certificates issued by SHA-1 signed CAs:

```
root@host # update-crypto-policies --set DEFAULT:SHA1
```

!!! note "Do I need to run this on my Compute Entrypoint (CE) hosts?"
    No. At this time, the Software Team believes that CE hosts are unaffected since their clients only present tokens
    and token issuers present modern CAs.

### rrdtool ###

To improve support for Python 3 based GlideinWMS in EL7,
the EL7 OSG Yum repositories contain a newer version of `rrdtool` than the operating system repositories.
This may cause dependency solving issues with non-OSG packages.
Therefore, on EL7 hosts that are not running GlideinWMS, we suggest adding the following line under the `[osg]` section
of `/etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo`:

```
excludepkgs=rrdtool
```

!!! note "No tarball client updates"
    This release does not contain any tarball client updates for EL7 or EL8.
    Initial EL9 tarballs will be released at a later date.

-   Critical [Gratia Probe 2.8.4](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gratia-probe/releases/tag/v2.8.4) update for
    HTCondor APs for all operating systems, fixing issues with `gratia-probe-condor-ap` 2.8.1 through 2.8.3.
    If you have any of these versions, please update and perform the following steps to process

        :::console
        # By default, this will bring you to /var/lib/condor-ce/gratia/data/
        root@host # cd $(condor_config_val PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR)
        root@host # mv quarantine/history* .

    !!! tip "Too many files for `mv`"
        If you have a busy AP, you may encounter too many files in the `quarantine` directory to move all at once.
        In this case, we suggest moving the history files to the `data` directory in batches.
        The Gratia Probe will handle history files in the `data` directory in bundles so you do not need to wait
        for processing to complete before moving the next batch over.

-   This is the initial release of OSG Software Stack for EL9!
    Notable differences between EL9 and EL7/EL8 include:
    -   Frontier Squid 5.8-2.1

        !!! warning "If you've already installed `frontier-squid-5.8-1.1` on an EL9 host..."
            You will need to uninstall `frontier-squid` and remove `/etc/init.d`.
            If you have any other packages that have files in `/etc/init.d`, they may also need to be reinstalled and
            cleaned up in a similar fashion.

### **February 26, 2021:** 3.6 Released

!!! question "Where are GlideinWMS and XRootD?"
    XRootD and GlideinWMS are both absent in the initial OSG 3.6 release:
    we expect major version updates that may require manual intervention for both of these packages so we are holding
    their initial releases in this series until they are ready.


This initial release of the OSG 3.6 release series is based on the packages available in OSG 3.5.31.
One of the major changes in this release series is the shift to token-based authentication from GSI proxy-based
authentication.
Here is a list of the differences in this initial release:

-   GridFTP, GSI, and Hadoop are no longer available
-   Added packages to support token-based authentication
-   [HTCondor 8.9.11](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/v9_0/version-history/development-release-series-89.html#version-8-9-11):
    initial token support (8.9.12, which will contain default configuration using tokens, was delayed)
-   HTCondor-CE 5.0.0:
    support for Python 3
-   [Gratia Probe 2.0.0](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gratia-probe/releases/tag/v2.0.0-2):
    replace all batch system probes with the non-root HTCondor-CE probe
-   [OSG-Configure 4.0.0](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-configure/releases/tag/v4.0.0):
    - Deprecated RSV
    - Dropped unused configuration modules and attributes
    - Reorganized some configuration (see [update instructions](updating-to-osg-36.md#osg-configure) for more details)

In addition, we have updated our
[Software Release Policy](https://osg-htc.org/technology/policy/software-release/) to follow a rolling
release model.

Finally, our [Docker image releases](https://osg-htc.org/technology/policy/container-release/) will more
closely track our OSG 3.6 repositories.
