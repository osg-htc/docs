OSG Software Supported Operating Systems
==========================================

The OSG Software 3.4 release series is supported on Red Hat Enterprise 6 and 7 and compatible platforms,
for 64-bit Intel architectures.

OSG also supports select rebuilds of RHEL.  Specifically:

-   CentOS 6
-   CentOS 7
-   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
-   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
-   Scientific Linux 6
-   Scientific Linux 7

OSG builds and tests its RPMs on the latest releases of the relevant platforms (e.g., in 2018, the RHEL 7 builds were based on RHEL 7.5).
Older releases of the OS may not receive thorough testing and may have subtle bugs.
In particular, versions of RHEL/CentOS/SL 7 less than 7.5 have known issues with several pieces of software, including `osg-oasis` and `xrootd-lcmaps`.
If sites run into problems with one of those versions, we will ask them to update to the latest OS packages as part of the support process.

The OSG Software 3.3 release series was supported on Red Hat Enterprise 6 (32-bit and 64-bit) and 7 (64-bit only) and compatible
platforms.  Support for this release series (including security patches) ended in May 2018.  If you need help migrating from OSG 3.3,
please contact support@opensciencegrid.org.
