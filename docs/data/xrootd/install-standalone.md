title: Install XRootD Standalone
DateReviewed: 2022-03-24

Install XRootD Standalone
=========================

[XRootD](http://xrootd.org/) is a hierarchical storage system that can be used in many ways to access data,
typically distributed among actual storage resources.
In its standalone configuration, XRootD acts as a simple layer exporting data from a storage system to the outside world.

This document focuses on installing a default configuration of XRootD standalone that provides the following features:

- Supports any POSIX-based storage system
- Macaroons, X.509 proxy, and VOMS proxy authentication
- Third-Party Copy over HTTP (HTTP-TPC)

Before Starting
---------------

Before starting the installation process, consider the following points:

-   **User IDs:** If it does not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user ID `xrootd`
-   **Service certificate:** The XRootD service uses a host certificate and key pair at
    `/etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdcert.pem` and `/etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdkey.pem` that must be owned by the `xrootd` user
-   **Networking:** The XRootD service uses port 1094 by default

As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:

-   Ensure the host has [a supported operating system](../../release/supported_platforms.md)
-   Obtain root access to the host
-   Prepare [the required Yum repositories](../../common/yum.md)
-   Install [CA certificates](../../common/ca.md)

Installing XRootD
-----------------

To install an XRootD Standalone server, run the following command:

```console
root@xrootd-standalone # yum install osg-xrootd-standalone
```

Configuring XRootD
------------------

To configure XRootD as a standalone server, you will modify `/etc/xrootd/xrootd-standalone.cfg` and the config files
under `/etc/xrootd/config.d/` as follows:

1.  Configure a `rootdir` in `/etc/xrootd/config.d/10-common-site-local.cfg`, to point to the top of the directory
    hierarchy which you wish to serve via XRootD.

        set rootdir = <DIRECTORY>

    !!! danger "Carefully consider your `rootdir`"
        Do not set `rootdir` to `/`.
        This might result in serving private information.

1.  If you want to limit the sub-directories to serve under your configured `rootdir`,
    comment out the `all.export /` directive in
    `/etc/xrootd/config.d/90-osg-standalone-paths.cfg`,
    and add an `all.export` directive for each directory under `rootdir` that you wish to serve via XRootD.
    
    This is useful if you have a mixture of files under your `rootdir`, for example from multiple users,
    but only want to expose a subset of them to the world.
    
    For example, to serve the contents of `/data/store` and `/data/public` (with `rootdir` configured to `/data`):

        all.export /store/
        all.export /public/

    If you want to serve everything under your configured `rootdir`, you don't have to change anything.

    !!! danger
        The directories specified this way are writable by default.
        Access controls should be managed via [authorization configuration](#configuring-authentication-and-authorization).

1. In `/etc/xrootd/config.d/10-common-site-local.cfg`, add a line to set the `resourcename` variable.
   Unless your supported VOs' policies state otherwise,
   this should match the [resource name](../../common/registration.md#registering-resources) of your XRootD service.
   For example, the XRootD service registered at the
   [University of Florida site](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/b14218d6e9d9df013a42e4d8538b2eeea615514c/topology/University%20of%20Florida/UF%20HPC/UFlorida-HPC.yaml#L250)
   should set the following configuration:

        set resourcename = UFlorida-XRD

### Configuring authentication and authorization

XRootD offers several authentication options using security plugins to validate incoming credentials, such as bearer tokens, X.509 proxies, and VOMS proxies.
Please follow the [XRootD authorization documentation](xrootd-authorization.md) for instructions on how to configure authentication and authorization,
including validating credentials and mapping them to users if desired.

### Optional configuration

The following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be required for setting up a small site.
If you do not need any of the following special configurations, skip to
[the section on using XRootD](#using-xrootd).


#### Enabling multi-user support

The `xrootd-multiuser` plugin allows XRootD to write files on the storage system as the
[authenticated](xrootd-authorization.md) user instead of the `xrootd` user.
If your XRootD service only allows read-only access, you should skip installation of this plugin.

To set up XRootD in multi-user mode, install the `xrootd-multiuser` package:

``` console
root@xrootd-standalone # yum install xrootd-multiuser
```

If you are using XRootD-Multiuser with a VOMS FQAN, you need XRootD 5.5.0 or greater.

#### Throttling IO requests

XRootD allows throttling of requests to the underlying filesystem.
To enable this,

1.  In an `/etc/xrootd/config.d/*.cfg` file, e.g. `/etc/xrootd/config.d/99-local.cfg`, set the following configuration:

        xrootd.fslib throttle default
        throttle.throttle concurrency <CONCUR> data <RATE>

    Replacing `<CONCUR>` with the IO concurrency limit, measured in seconds
    (e.g., 100 connections taking 1ms each, would be 0.1), and `<RATE>` with the data rate limit in bytes per second.
    Note that you may also just specify either the concurrency limit:

        xrootd.fslib throttle default
        throttle.throttle concurrency <CONCUR>

    Or the data rate limit:

        xrootd.fslib throttle default
        throttle.throttle data <RATE>

1.  If XRootD is already running, restart the relevant [XRootD service](#using-xrootd) for your configuration to take
    effect.

For more details of the throttling implementation,
see the [upstream documentation](https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/tree/master/src/XrdThrottle).

#### Enabling CMS TFC support (CMS sites only)

For CMS sites, there is a package available to integrate rule-based name lookup using a `storage.xml` file.
If you are not setting up a service for CMS, skip this section.

To install an `xrootd-cmstfc`, run the following command:

``` console
root@xrootd-standalone # yum install --enablerepo=osg-contrib xrootd-cmstfc
```

You will need to add your `storage.xml` to `/etc/xrootd/storage.xml` and then add the following line to your XRootD
configuration:

``` file
# Integrate with CMS TFC, placed in /etc/xrootd/storage.xml
oss.namelib /usr/lib64/libXrdCmsTfc.so file:/etc/xrootd/storage.xml?protocol=hadoop
```

Add the orange text only if you are running hadoop (see below).

See the CMS TWiki for more information:

-   <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/HdfsXrootdInstall>

Using XRootD
------------

In addition to the XRootD service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation.
The specific services are:

| Software          | Service Name                          | Notes                                                                                                       |
|:------------------|:--------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fetch CRL         | EL8,EL9: `fetch-crl.timer` <br> EL7: `fetch-crl-boot` and `fetch-crl-cron` | See [CA documentation](../../common/ca.md#managing-fetch-crl-services) for more info                        |
| XRootD            | `xrootd@standalone`                   | Primary xrootd service if _not_ running in [multi-user mode](#enabling-multi-user-support)                |
| XRootD Multi-user | `xrootd-privileged@standalone`        | Primary xrootd service to start _instead of_ `xrootd@standalone` if running in [multi-user mode](#enabling-multi-user-support) |

Start the services in the order listed and stop them in reverse order.
As a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as `root`):

| To …                                        | Run the command…                 |
|:--------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| Start a service                             | `systemctl start SERVICE-NAME`   |
| Stop a service                              | `systemctl stop SERVICE-NAME`    |
| Enable a service to start during boot       | `systemctl enable SERVICE-NAME`  |
| Disable a service from starting during boot | `systemctl disable SERVICE-NAME` |

Validating XRootD
-----------------

To validate an XRootD installation, perform the following verification steps:

!!! note
    If you have configured authentication/authorization for XRootD,
    be sure you have given yourself the necessary permissions to run these tests.
    For example, if you are using an X.509 proxy,
    make sure your DN is mapped to a user in [/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile](xrootd-authorization.md#mapping-subject-dns),
    make sure you have a valid proxy on your local machine,
    and ensure that the [Authfile](xrootd-authorization.md#authorization-database) on the XRootD server gives
    write access to the mapped user from `/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile`.

1. Verify [authorization](xrootd-authorization.md#verifying-xrootd-authorization) of bearer tokens and/or proxies

1.  Verify HTTP-TPC using the same GFAL2 client tools:

    !!! bug "Requires gfal2 >= 2.20.0"
        `gfal2-2.20.0` contains a fix for a bug affecting XRootD HTTP-TPC support.

    1.  Copy a file from your XRootD standalone host to another host and path where you have write access:

            :::console
            root@xrootd-standalone # gfal-copy davs://localhost:1094/<PATH TO LOCAL FILE> \
                                               <REMOTE HOST>/<PATH TO WRITE REMOTE FILE>

        Replacing `<PATH TO LOCAL FILE>` with the path to a file that you can read on your host relative to `rootdir`;
        `<REMOTE HOST>` with the protocol, FQDN, and port of the remote storage host;
        and `<PATH TO WRITE REMOTE FILE>` to a location on the remote storage host where you have write access.

    1.  Copy a file from a remote host where you have read access to your XRootD standalone installation:

            :::console
            root@xrootd-standalone # gfal-copy <REMOTE HOST>/<PATH TO REMOTE FILE> \
                                               davs://localhost:1094/<PATH TO WRITE LOCAL FILE>

        Replacing `<REMOTE HOST>` with the protocol, FQDN, and port of the remote storage host;
        `<PATH TO REMOTE FILE>` with the path to a file that you can read on the remote storage host;
        and `<PATH TO WRITE LOCAL FILE>` to a location on the XRootD standalone host relative to `rootdir` where you
        have write access.

Registering an XRootD Standalone Server
---------------------------------------

To register your XRootD server, follow the general registration instructions
[here](../../common/registration.md#new-resources) with the following XRootD-specific details:

1.  Add an `XRootD component:` section to the `Services:` list, with any relevant fields for that service.
    This is a partial example:

        :::console
        ...
        FQDN: <FULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME>
        Services:
          XRootD component:
            Description: Standalone XRootD server
        ...

    Replacing `<FULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME>` with your XRootD server's DNS entry.

2.  If you are setting up a new resource, set `Active: false`.
    Only set `Active: true` for a resource when it is accepting requests and ready for production.

### Service Configuration

The configuration that your XRootD service uses is determined by the service name given to `systemctl`.
To use the standalone config, you would start XRootD with the following command:

``` console
root@host # systemctl start xrootd@standalone
```
