Access Point Acceptable Use Policy For the OSPool
=================================================

!!! warning "DRAFT"
    This document is a work in progress.

The Open Science Pool (OSPool) offers capacity contributed by organizations that are members of the OSG Compute
Federation.
The OSPool grants Access Points the ability to access the nation’s computing capacity for the benefit of the
research community.
It is the responsibility of all parties involved to maximize the impact of these contributions to
Open Science.
This AUP outlines the responsibilities in achieving this goal of OSG users that place their workloads on
OSG managed Access Points (APs) to harness the capacity of the OSPool.

General Use Limitations
-----------------------

In addition to the user or operator specific policies outlined in the sections below,
all AP users and operators are expected to adhere to the following usage limitations:

-   You agree that work running on the OSPool through your Access Point will be relevant to research and/or education
    efforts associated with an academic, government, or non-profit institution in the United States.
    Use by external collaborators of such an institution are permitted, provided they are relevant as defined above.
    Use of other resources and services via the Access Point should also follow relevant policies of use for those
    resources and services.
-   Efforts benefitting from the OSPool and other Access Point features shall provide appropriate acknowledgement of
    support or citation;
    please see
    [this page](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000640421-acknowledging-the-open-science-grid)
    for information about citation.
-   You shall not use the Access Point or OSPool for any purpose that is unlawful and not (attempt to) breach or
    circumvent any administrative or security controls.
-   You shall respect intellectual property and confidentiality agreements.
-   You shall protect your access credentials (e.g. private keys, tokens, or passwords).
-   You shall keep all your registered information correct and up to date.
-   You shall immediately report any known or suspected security breach or misuse of the resources/services or access
    credentials to the specified incident reporting locations and to the relevant credential-issuing authorities.
-   You use the resources/services at your own risk. There is no guarantee that the
-   resources/services will be available at any time or that their integrity or confidentiality will be preserved or
    that they will suit any purpose.
-   You agree that logged information, including personal data provided by you for registration purposes, may be used
    for administrative, operational, accounting, monitoring and security purposes.
    You agree that this logged information may be disclosed to other authorized participants via secured mechanisms,
    only for the same purposes and only as far as necessary to provide the services.
-   You agree that the body or bodies granting you access and resource/service providers are entitled to regulate,
    suspend or terminate your access without prior notice and without compensation, within their domain of authority,
    and you shall immediately comply with their instructions.
-   You are liable for the consequences of your violation of any of these conditions of use, which may include but are
    not limited to the reporting of your violation to your home institute and, if the activities are thought to be
    illegal, to appropriate law enforcement agencies.

Access Point Operation Policy
-----------------------------

This Operational Policy enumerates the roles and responsibilities of the Access Point (AP) operator;
the operator of an AP is then responsible for their users' behaviors.

The OSG Consortium collects metadata about the jobs run on the OSPool to present resources and funding agencies with
information like the resource usage, project, and field of science;
APs must participate in this resource accounting system.
Additionally, the statistics about jobs (aggregated per-user-per-project) will be used to monitor the overall health and
throughput of the pool;
staff may follow up with APs in light of poor resource utilization.

As the OSPool operations staff has a responsibility to the entire pool, the OSPool operations staff may disable the AP’s
connection to the OSPool, as necessary, to maintain operational integrity and resource utilization.
When disabled, the AP will no longer receive resources from the OSPool (but may still use other non-OSPool resources).
If the OSPool operators are unable to contact the AP administrator in a timely manner to respond to an urgent
operational issue (such as a security incident or workload crashing execution points), they may disable the AP.
To reduce the security attack surface of the OSPool, operators will disable APs that have been idle for more than 90
days.  APs will need to contact the OSPool operators to be re-enabled.
