title: Installing the Worker Node Client via OASIS

Installing the Worker Node Client via OASIS
===========================================

The **OSG Worker Node Client** is a collection of software components that is expected to be added to every worker node
that can run OSG jobs. It provides a common environment and a minimal set of common tools that all OSG jobs can expect
to use.
Contents of the worker node client can be found [here](using-wn.md#common-software-available-on-worker-nodes).

!!! note
    It is possible to install the Worker Node Client software in a variety of ways, depending on your local site:

    -   Use from OASIS (this guide) - useful when [CVMFS](install-cvmfs.md) is already mounted on your worker nodes
    -   [Install using a tarball](install-wn-tarball.md) - useful when installing onto a shared filesystem for distribution to worker nodes
    -   [Install using RPMs and Yum](install-wn.md) - useful when managing your worker nodes with a tool (e.g., Puppet, Chef) that can automate RPM installs

This document is intended to guide system administrators through the process of configuring a site to make the Worker Node Client software available from OASIS.

Before Starting
---------------

As with all OSG Software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:

-   Ensure the host has [a supported operating system](../release/supported_platforms.md)
-   On every worker node, [install and configure CVMFS](install-cvmfs.md)

Once configured to use OASIS, OSG jobs will download the worker-node software on demand (into the local disk cache).
This may result in extra network activity, especially on first use of the client tools.

Configure the CE
----------------

Determine the OASIS path to the Worker Node Client software for your worker nodes:

| Worker Node OS | Use…                                                                                 |
|:---------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EL 8 (64-bit)  |  `/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/24/current/el8-x86_64` |
| EL 9 (64-bit)  |  `/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/24/current/el9-x86_64` |

On the CE, in the `/etc/osg/config.d/10-storage.ini` file, set the `grid_dir` configuration setting to the path from the previous step.

Once you finish making changes to configuration files on your CE, validate, fix, and apply the configuration:

```console
root@host # osg-configure -v
root@host # osg-configure -c
```

For more information, see the [OSG worker node environment documentation](../worker-node/using-wn.md) and the
[CE configuration instructions](../other/configuration-with-osg-configure.md#storage).

Validating the Worker Node Client
---------------------------------

To verify functionality of the worker node client, you will need to submit a test job against your CE and verify the job's output.

1.  Submit a job that executes the `env` command (e.g. Run [condor\_ce\_trace](https://htcondor.github.io/htcondor-ce/v24/troubleshooting/debugging-tools/#condor_ce_trace) with the `-d` flag from your HTCondor CE)
2.  Verify that the value of `OSG_GRID` is set to the directory of your WN Client installation

### Manually Using the Worker Node Client From OASIS

If you must log onto a worker node and use the Worker Node Client software directly during your login session, consult the following table for the command to set up your environment:

| Worker Node OS | Run the following command…                                                                           |
|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EL 8 (64-bit)  |  `source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/24/current/el8-x86_64/setup.sh` |
| EL 9 (64-bit)  |  `source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/24/current/el9-x86_64/setup.sh` |
