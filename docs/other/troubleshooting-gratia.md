title: Troubleshooting Gratia Accounting
DateReviewed: 2022-05-06

Troubleshooting Gratia Accounting
=================================

Gratia is software used in OSG to gather accounting information for usage of computational resources.
This information is collected from individual services at a site,
such as a Compute Entrypoint (CE) or an Access Point (AP),
through "Gratia probes" and transferred to the central OSG GRACC server.

Gratia probes are run periodically as cron jobs under an HTCondor Schedd process (i.e., Schedd cron jobs) as the
`condor` user.
The commands that you run, configuration locations that you verify, and log locations that you check will depend on the
type of host that you are troubleshooting.

Accounting Architecture
-----------------------

![Gratia Basics](../img/gratia-overview.png)

These are the definitions of the major elements in the above figure.

-   **Gratia probe**: A piece of software that collects accounting data from the host on which it's running, and
    transmits it to the GRACC server.
-   **GRACC server**: A server that collects Gratia accounting data from one or more sites and can share it with users
    via a web page.
    The GRACC server is hosted by the OSG.
-   **Reporter**: A web service running on the GRACC server.
    Users can connect to the reporter via a web browser to explore the Gratia data.
-   **Collector**: A web service running on the GRACC server that collects data from one or more Gratia probes.
    Users do not directly interact with the collector.

You can explore the details of the OSG accounting data at <https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org> and
<https://display.opensciencegrid.org/>.

Determine Your Host Type
------------------------

Before continuing with the rest of the document, it is important to know what type of host you are troubleshooting:

-  Do users log into this host and submit jobs? Then you are running an **Access Point**
-  Does this host accept pilot jobs from remote clients? Then you are running a **Compute Entrypoint**

If you are still not sure, you can run the following command to determine if this is a CE installation:

``` console
$ rpm -q osg-ce
osg-ce-24-1.osg24.el9.x86_64
```

If the output is blank, then you are not working with a CE host.

!!! note "Access Points vs Compute Entrypoints"
    A single host should not be used as both an AP and a CE but if you've inherited a host,
    it's possible that the host was installed improperly.

Is Gratia Up-To-Date?
---------------------

Ensure that you have the latest bug-fixes:

```
yum update 'gratia-probe*'
```

Is Gratia Running?
------------------

Since Gratia probes run as Schedd cron jobs, first verify that the relevant HTCondor service is running based on the
type of host that you are troubleshooting:

| **Host**           | **Command**                  |
|:-------------------|------------------------------|
| Access Point       | `systemctl status condor`    |
| Compute Entrypoint | `systemctl status condor-ce` |

If they are not running, consult the relevant documentation to enable and start the appropriate service:

-   [Access Point](../submit/install-ospool-ap.md#managing-services)
-   [Compute Entrypoint](https://htcondor.com/htcondor-ce/v24/operation/#managing-htcondor-ce-services)

### Identifying failures ###

Schedd cron jobs are logged to the SchedLog, whose location depends on the type of host you are troubleshooting:

| **Host**           | **Log Path**                  |
|:-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Access Point       | `/var/log/condor/SchedLog`    |
| Compute Entrypoint | `/var/log/condor-ce/SchedLog` |

Currently, the default log level does not show Schedd cron job activity (future releases will show failures by default)
so you must perform the following steps to see the relevant log messages:

1.  Identify the configuration location for your host:

    | **Host**           | **Configuration Directory** |
    |:-------------------|-----------------------------|
    | Access Point       | `/etc/condor/config.d`      |
    | Compute Entrypoint | `/etc/condor-ce/config.d`   |

1.  In a `.conf` file in the configuration directory that you determined above, increase the debug level:

        SCHEDD_DEBUG = $(SCHEDD_DEBUG) D_CAT D_ALWAYS:2

Successful cron jobs will appear in the relevant `SchedLog` like so: 

```
05/06/22 19:25:31 (D_ALWAYS:2) CronJob: Starting job 'GRATIA' (/usr/share/gratia/htcondor-ce/condor_meter)
05/06/22 19:25:31 (D_ALWAYS:2) Create_Process: using fast clone() to create child process.
05/06/22 19:25:31 (D_ALWAYS:2) CronJob: STDOUT closed for 'GRATIA'
05/06/22 19:25:31 (D_ALWAYS:2) CronJob: STDERR closed for 'GRATIA'
05/06/22 19:25:31 (D_ALWAYS:2) CronJob: 'GRATIA' (pid 1082) exit_status=0
05/06/22 19:25:31 (D_ALWAYS:2) CronJob::Schedule 'GRATIA' IR=F IP=T IWE=F IOS=F IOD=F nr=116 nf=0
05/06/22 19:25:31 (D_ALWAYS:2) CronJob::Schedule 'GRATIA_CLEANUP' IR=F IP=T IWE=F IOS=F IOD=F nr=2 nf=0
```

### Verifying packaging ###

Gratia probe RPM packaging will create the appropriate files and folder structure with the correct permissions so that
Gratia probes can run smoothly.
However, it's possible that stale configuration management or other automation scripts at your site could 
To verify that file contents and ownership have not been changed, run one of the following commands based on the type of
host you are troubleshooting:

| **Host**           | **Command**                                |
|:-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Access Point       | `rpm -q --verify gratia-probe-condor-ap`   |
| Compute Entrypoint | `rpm -q --verify gratia-probe-htcondor-ce` |

### Verifying configuration ###

When troubleshooting Gratia, there are two different configurations to investigate:

-   [HTCondor configuration](#htcondor-configuration) if job history records aren't being processed.
-   [Gratia ProbeConfig](#gratia-probeconfig) if your job history records are being processed but they are either
    malformed or are not being sent to the GRACC

#### HTCondor configuration ####

The HTCondor and/or HTCondor-CE configuration determines where job history files are written and how often the Gratia
probe Schedd cron job are run.

##### Access Points ####

Verify the values of your HTCondor `PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR` configurations match the output below:

``` console
# condor_config_val -v PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR
PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR = /var/lib/condor/gratia/data
 # at: /usr/share/condor/config.d/50-gratia-gwms.conf, line 28
 # raw: PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR = /var/lib/condor/gratia/data

```

- **If you see the above output**, your Gratia Probe configuration is correct and you may continue onto the
  [next section](#gratia-probeconfig).

- **If you do not see the above output**:

    1.  If the value of `condor_config_val -v PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR` is not `/var/lib/condor/gratia/data`
        note its value.
        Then visit the referenced file, remove the offending configuration and repeat until the output of
        `condor_config_val -v PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR` matches the above output.

    1.  If you noted a different value in step a, copy data from the old directory to the new directory and fix ensure
        that ownership is correct:

            :::console
            root@host # cp  <ORIGINAL DIR>/* /var/lib/condor/gratia/data/
            root@host # chown -R condor:condor /var/lib/condor/gratia/data/

        Replacing `<ORIGINAL_DIR>` with the value that you noted in step a.

##### HTCondor-CE and HTCondor batch systems #####

Verify the values of your HTCondor and HTCondor-CE `PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR` configurations match the output below:

``` console
# condor_ce_config_val -v PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR
Not defined: PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR
 # at: <Default>
 # raw: PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR = 

# condor_config_val -v PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR
PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR = /var/lib/condor-ce/gratia/data
 # at: /etc/condor/config.d/99-gratia.conf, line 5
 # raw: PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR = /var/lib/condor-ce/gratia/data
```

- **If you see the above output**, your Gratia Probe configuration is correct and you may continue onto the
  [next section](#gratia-probeconfig).

- **If you do not see the above output**:

    1.  If the value of `condor_config_val -v PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR` is not `/var/lib/condor-ce/gratia/data`
        note its value.
        Then visit the referenced file, remove the offending configuration and repeat until the output of
        `condor_config_val -v PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR` matches the above output.

    1.  If the value of `condor_ce_config_val -v PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR` is set,
        visit the referenced file and remove the offending configuration.
        Repeat until the output of `condor_ce_config_val -v PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR` matches the above output.

    1.  If you noted a different value in step a, copy data from the old directory to the new directory and fix ensure
        that ownership is correct:

            :::console
            root@host # cp  <ORIGINAL DIR>/* /var/lib/condor-ce/gratia/data/
            root@host # chown -R condor:condor /var/lib/condor-ce/gratia/data/

        Replacing `<ORIGINAL_DIR>` with the value that you noted in step a.

##### HTCondor-CE and non-HTCondor batch systems #####

After updating your `gratia-probe-*` packages,
verify that your HTCondor-CE's `PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR` is set to `/var/lib/condor-ce/gratia/data`:

```console
root@host # condor_ce_config_val -v PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR
PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR = /var/lib/condor-ce/gratia/data
# at: /etc/condor-ce/config.d/99_gratia-ce.conf, line 5
# raw: PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR = /var/lib/condor-ce/gratia/data
```

- **If you see the above output**, your Gratia Probe configuration is correct and you may continue onto the
  [next section](#gratia-probeconfig).

- **If you do not see the above output**, visit the file listed in the output of `condor_ce_config_val`, remove the
  offending value, and repeat until the proper value is returned.

### Gratia ProbeConfig ###

#### Access Points ####

Verify that your Gratia configuration is correct in `/etc/gratia/condor-ap/ProbeConfig` based on the table below:

1.  Fill in the value for `SiteName` with the Resource Name you registered in Topology (see
    [this section](../submit/install-ospool-ap.md#register-your-access-point-in-osg-topology) for details).
    For example:
   
        :::xml
        SiteName="OSG_US_EXAMPLE_SUBMIT"

1.  Set the ProbeName:

        :::xml
        ProbeName="condor-ap:<HOST_FQDN>"

    Replacing `<HOST_FQDN>` with your access point's fully qualifed domain name

1.  Enable the Gratia Probe:

        :::xml
        EnableProbe="1"

#### Compute Entrypoints ####

In normal cases, `osg-configure` manages the relevant ProbeConfig and it can be configured by modifying
`/etc/osg/config.d/30-gratia.ini`.
Consult the [osg-configuration documentation](configuration-with-osg-configure.md#gratia) for details.

If there are problems or special configuration, you might need to edit the Gratia configuration files yourself by
modifying `/etc/gratia/htcondor-ce/ProbeConfig`.

The ProbeConfig files have many details.
A few options that you might need to edit are shown before.
This is **not** a complete file, but only shows a subset of the options.

``` file
<ProbeConfiguration 

    CollectorHost="gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80"
    SSLHost="gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80"
    SSLRegistrationHost="gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80"

    ProbeName="htcondor-ce:fermicloud084.fnal.gov"
    SiteName="WISC_OSG_EDU"
    EnableProbe="1"
/>
```

The options you see here are:

| Option              | Comments                                                                               |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CollectorHost       | The GRACC server this probe reports to                                                |
| SSLHost             | The GRACC server this probe reports to                                                |
| SSLRegistrationHost | The GRACC server this probe reports to                                                |
| ProbeName           | The unique name for this probe. Note that it includes the probe type and the host name |
| SiteName            | The name of your Resource, as registered in [OSG Topology](../common/registration.md).      |
| EnableProbe         | The probe will only run if this is "1"                                                 |

Again, there are many more options in this file. Most of the time you won't need to touch them.

Have Records Been Uploaded To the GRACC?
----------------------------------------

If you have verified that your [Gratia probe is running](#is-gratia-running) and you are receiving pilot jobs,
you should see data in the GRACC for your service approximately 24h after jobs have completed successfully by entering
your Topology-registered site name into the `Facility` dropdown:

-   [Access Points](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000037/payload-jobs-summary?orgId=1)
-   [Compute Entrypoints](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000043/pilot-jobs-summary?orgId=1)

If you still aren't seeing data in GRACC, use this section to ensure that your resources are registered properly.

### Have you configured the resource names correctly? ###

#### Access Points ####

Ensure that `SiteName` in your ProbeConfig matches your Topology-registered resource name.
See [this section](#access-points_1) for details

#### Compute Entrypoints ####

Do the names of your resources match the names in
[OSG Topology](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/tree/master/topology)?
Gratia retrieves the resource name from the `Site Information` section of the `/etc/osg/config.d/40-siteinfo.ini`


``` file
;===================================================================
;                       Site Information
;===================================================================

[Site Information]
; Set "group" to "OSG" for a production site, or "OSG-ITB" for an ITB site.
; 
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS
group = OSG

; Set "host_name" to the host name of the CE being configured.
; This should resolve in DNS; if DNS is not set up yet, enter an IPv4/v6 address instead.
;
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS
host_name = tusker-gw1.unl.edu

; Set "resource" to the name of the resource that you have registered
; in the OSG topology repository at https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology
; 
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS
resource = Tusker-CE1

```

Do those names match the names that you registered with OSG Topology?
If not, edit the names, and rerun "osg-configure -c".

### Did the site name change? ###

Was the site previously reporting data, but the registered Topology site name changed?
When the site name changes, you need to ask the GRACC operations team to update the name of your site at the GRACC
collector:

1.  Open a [support ticket](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/helpdesk/tickets/new)
1.  Select "Software or Service"
1.  Select "GRACC Operations"
1.  Write a friendly email that asks the GRACC team to change your site name at the collector.
    Make sure to tell them the old name and the new name:

        Hello GRACC Team,
        
        Please change the site name of my site from <OLD NAME> to <NEW NAME>.
        
        Thanks, ...
