Installation Guides
===================

The Open Science Grid consists primarily of a fabric of services at
participating sites.

One of the most common ways of participating in the OSG is to install
one of our software services at your site and provide computational
power opportunistically to the grid.

Our most common software products include:

* [HTCondor CE Installation](docs/compute-entrypoint/HTCondor_CE.md): Provides a _gateway_
  between the grid and your batch system.
* [HTTP Proxy](docs/data/frontier-squid.md): Caches the most commonly-used files at your
  site to preserve bandwidth (a custom packaging of the venerable `squid` software).
